In these games, played on a lattice, an additional spatial layer is introduced for dependence on more complex parameters and simulation of changes in the environment. Furthermore, diverse polymorphic equilibrium points dependent on cell reproduction, model parameters, and their simulation are discussed. Our analysis demonstrates the sensitivity properties of \{MSEGs\} and possibilities for further development. We discuss applications of MSEGs, particularly algorithms for modelling cell interactions during the development of tumours. "

abstract = "Abstract Living cells, like whole living organisms during evolution, communicate with their neighbors, interact with the environment, divide, change their phenotypes, and eventually die. The development of specific ways of communication (through signaling molecules and receptors) allows some cellular subpopulations to survive better, to coordinate their physiological status, and during embryonal development to create tissues and organs or in some conditions to become tumors. Populations of cells cultured in vitro interact similarly, also competing for space and nutrients and stimulating each other to better survive or to die. The results of these intercellular interactions of different types seem to be good examples of biological evolutionary games, and have been the subjects of simulations by the methods of evolutionary game theory where individual cells are treated as players. Here we present examples of intercellular contacts in a population of living human cancer HeLa cells cultured in vitro and propose an evolutionary game theory approach to model the development of such populations. We propose a new technique termed Mixed Spatial Evolutionary Games (MSEG) which are played on multiple lattices corresponding to the possible cellular phenotypes which gives the possibility of simulating and investigating the effects of heterogeneity at the cellular level in addition to the population level. Analyses performed with \{MSEG\} suggested different ways in which cellular populations develop in the case of cells communicating directly and through factors released to the environment. "

Although \{MOBA\} is currently one of the most played genres around the world, it is known as a game that offer less autonomy, more challenges and consequently more frustration. Due to these characteristics, the use of a mechanism that performs the difficulty balance dynamically seems to be an interesting alternative to minimize and/or avoid that players experience such frustrations. In this sense, this paper presents a dynamic difficulty adjustment mechanism for \{MOBA\} games. The main idea is to create a computer controlled opponent that adapts dynamically to the player performance, trying to offer to the player a better game experience. This is done by evaluating the performance of the player using a metric based on some game features and switching the difficulty of the opponent’s artificial intelligence behavior accordingly. Quantitative and qualitative experiments were performed and the results showed that the system is capable of adapting dynamically to the opponent’s skills. In spite of that, the qualitative experiments with users showed that the player’s expertise has a greater influence on the perception of the difficulty level and dynamic adaptation. "

The goal is to construct, using representative statistics computed from children's physiological signals, an estimator of the degree to which games provided by the playground engage the players. Previous studies have identified the difficulties of isolating elements of physical activity attributed to reported entertainment derived (solely) from heart rate (HR) recordings. In the present article, a survey experiment on a larger scale and a physical activity control experiment for surmounting those difficulties are devised. In these experiments, children's HR, blood volume pulse (BVP) and skin conductance (SC) signals, as well as their expressed preferences of how much “fun” particular game variants are, are obtained using games implemented on the Playware physical interactive playground. Given effective data collection, a set of numerical features is computed from these measurements of the child's physiological state. A comprehensive statistical analysis shows that children's reported entertainment preferences correlate well with specific features of the recorded signals. Preference learning techniques combined with feature set selection methods permit the construction of user models that predict reported entertainment preferences given suitable signal features. The most accurate models are obtained through evolving artificial neural networks and are demonstrated and evaluated on a Playware game and a control task requiring physical activity. The best network is able to correctly match expressed preferences in 69.64% of cases on previously unseen data ( p -value = 0.0022 ) and indicates two dissimilar classes of children: those that prefer constantly energetic play of low mental/emotional load; and those that report as fun a dynamic play that involves high mental/emotional load independently of physical effort. The generality of the methodology, its limitations, its usability as a real-time feedback mechanism for entertainment augmentation and as a validation tool are discussed. "

These three methods are then compared on their ability to represent individual human decision makers. Comparisons are conducted using three different proposed metrics that address the problem of matching decisions at the action, tactical, and strategic levels. Results indicate that a small gallery of personas evolved from designer intuitions can capture human decision making styles equally well as clones evolved from human play-traces for the testbed game MiniDungeons.

abstract = "Abstract Intelligent agents are widely used in robotics, gaming and simulation. A key issue is modelling human behaviours so that intelligent agents can use a human’s behavioural model to imitate them and predict their next moves. In this article, we use Internet-based multiplayer online gaming (MOG) as a case study to present our approach to predictive user modelling through behavioural analysis of online gameplay data. As latency is an inherited bottleneck of the Internet and is likely to remain so into a foreseeable future, a lot of efforts have been made to address the resulting issues. Most of the existing latency handling techniques are based on the assumption that latency is within an acceptable threshold so that they can alleviate or even completely hide its negative impact on players’ quality of experience (QoE) that directly determines consumers’ satisfaction of the provided \{MOG\} services. While this assumption is mostly valid, it is worth noting that a player’s Internet connection latency always fluctuates (known as jitter), possibly to the extent of exceeding a MOG’s designated threshold in which case none of the techniques can handle properly but disconnecting the player from the gameplay session. Forcing a player to quit prematurely simply due to a spike of unusual high latency has a significant negative impact both on the gameplay’s fairness and on the player’s QoE. To improve customer satisfaction of a \{MOG\} service, we propose a more tolerant approach by temporarily substituting a player with a humanoid bot in the event of latency hikes so that the player always remains in the gameplay session. The challenge in this approach is to create a personalised humanoid bot that can imitate the playing pattern of the individual human player being substituted. Our solution is to first extract key variables that have impact on the human player’s decision-makings through behavioural analysis of the player’s historical gameplay data, then model the relationships among these variables, and finally creates the player’s humanoid bot with the model. In this paper, we use a multiplayer online pong game as a case study to explain behavioural variables, modelling techniques, processes, outcomes, and performance studies. "

Most of these games are purely for entertainment, but use of computer games for education has also expanded dramatically. At the same time, experimental games have become a staple of social science research but have depended on relatively small sample sizes and simple, abstract situations, limiting their range and applicability. If only a fraction of the time spent playing computer games could be harnessed for research, it would open up a huge range of new opportunities. We review the use of games in research, education, and entertainment and develop ideas for integrating these three functions around the idea of ecosystem services valuation. This approach to valuation can be seen as a version of choice modeling that allows players to generate their own scenarios taking account of the trade-offs embedded in the game, rather than simply ranking pre-formed scenarios. We outline a prototype game called “Lagom Island” to test the proposition that gaming can be used to reveal the value of ecosystem services. Our prototype provides a potential pathway and functional building blocks for approaching the relatively untapped potential of games in the context of ecosystem services research. "

While this paper is motivated by my interest in inter- and intra-gender conflicts of interest in sexual reproduction, \{BNL\} games also arise just as naturally in most two-species interactions. Thus, the methodology may provide a novel approach to investigating such classical ecological phenomena as prey–predator/host–parasite interactions and interspecies competition for resources. Finally, given the growing tendency to utilize evolutionary games in economic modeling, a case can be made for the current paper being of interest to traditional game-theoretic modelers in connection with situations such as buyer/seller or employer/employee interaction.

In particular, a cooperative solution is subgame consistent if the optimality principle agreed upon at the outset remains in effect in any subgame starting at a later stage with a state brought about by prior optimal behavior. Hence the players do not have incentives to deviate from the previously adopted optimal behavior. For the first time, subgame consistent solutions in cooperative dynamic games with non-transferable payoffs/utility (NTU) using a variable payoff weights scheme is analyzed. A solution mechanism for characterizing subgame consistent solutions is derived. The use of a variable payoff weights scheme allows the derivation of subgame consistent solutions under a wide range of optimality principles. The analysis widens the application of \{NTU\} cooperative dynamic games through the provision of a dynamically stable solution. "

We show that the effect of the degree of adversity on the probability of cooperation is monotonous, and has an opposite sign for smaller and for larger cooperation costs. For intermediate cooperation costs, we show that the effect of a harsher environment on the probability of cooperation is hill-shaped. "

The Stackelberg payoff matrix is built under the nominal conditions, and then evaluated under different probable uncertain scenarios using a Monte-Carlo simulation. The competition between the Stackelberg game players and the third parties is solved through a Nash Equilibrium game. A novel way to analyze the game outcome is proposed based on a win–win Stackelberg set of “Pareto-frontiers”. The benefits of the resulting \{MINLP\} tactical models are illustrated by a case study with different vendors around a client SC. The results show that the coordinated decisions lead to higher expected payoffs compared to the standalone case, while also leading to uncertainty reduction. "

We study the beyond worst-case synthesis problem for two important quantitative settings: the mean-payoff and the shortest path. In both cases, we show how to decide the existence of finite-memory strategies satisfying the problem and how to synthesize one if one exists. We establish algorithms and we study complexity bounds and memory requirements. "

Results indicated that gamer identity, trait competitiveness, and playing habits modulate the experience of social identity threat. Performance and affective responses elicited by the Stereotype Threat Condition were more negatively affected in case of strongly identified gamers, highly competitive women, and/or avid players when compared with the other conditions.

Opponent modeling, predicting an opponent’s actions in advance of execution, is one approach for selecting actions in adversarial settings, but it is often performed in an ad hoc way. This chapter introduces several methods for using opponent modeling, in the form of predictions about the players’ physical movements, to learn team policies. To explore the problem of decision making in multiagent adversarial scenarios, we use our approach for both offline play generation and real-time team response in the Rush 2008 American Football Simulator. Simultaneously predicting movement trajectories, future reward, and play strategies of multiple players in real time is a daunting task, but we illustrate how it is possible to divide and conquer this problem with an assortment of data-driven models.

abstract = "Abstract Current affective user experience studies require both laborious and time-consuming data analysis, as well as dedicated affective classification algorithms. Moreover, the high technical complexity and lack of general guidelines for developing these affective classification algorithms further limits the comparability of the obtained results. In this paper we target this issue by presenting a tool capable of automatically annotating and triangulating players’ physiologically interpreted emotional reactions to in-game events. This tool was initially motivated by an experimental psychology study regarding the emotional habituation effects of audio-visual stimuli in digital games and we expect it to contribute in future similar studies by providing both a deeper and more objective analysis on the affective aspects of user experience. We also hope it will contribute towards the rapid implementation and accessibility of this type of studies by open-sourcing it. Throughout this paper we describe the development and benefits presented by our tool, which include: enabling researchers to conduct objective a posteriori analyses without disturbing the gameplay experience, automating the annotation and emotional response identification process, and formatted data exporting for further analysis in third-party statistical software applications.

The proposed stimulators are perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), social influence (SI), perceived self-efficacy (PSE) and perceived enjoyment (PE). \{PU\} and \{PEOU\} were derived from TAM, \{SI\} was taken from the TRA, \{TPB\} and \{DOI\} model, \{PE\} was obtained from the extended-TAM model and \{PSE\} was taken from Bandura’s theory. This is among the first study that uses a model consisting of integrated constructs from TAM, extended-TAM, TRA, TPB, \{DOI\} and Bandura’s theory in predicting acceptance of ME. Empirical data were analyzed by employing Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis. Gender moderating effect was examined via multiple group analysis (MGA). The findings revealed that PU, PEOU, \{SI\} and \{PE\} are positively associated with consumer \{IU\} of ME. Surprisingly, there were no significant moderating effects of gender. The control variables (i.e. age, marital status, education level, number of mobile phone and experience) were found to have no confounding effects on the \{ME\} adoption. The findings have contributed theoretical and managerial implications to \{ME\} providers, mobile phone manufacturers, the music, movie and gaming industry players. "

abstract = "Abstract Darwin’s theory of evolution - as introduced in game theory by Maynard Smith - is not the only important evolutionary aspect in an evolutionary dynamics, since complex interdependencies, competition, and growth should be modeled by, for example, reactive aspects. In the ultimatum game, the reciprocity and the fifty–fifty partition seems to be a deviation from rational behavior of the players under the light of Nash equilibrium. Such equilibrium emerges, for example, from the punishment of the responder who generally tends to refuse unfair proposals. In the iterated version of the game, the proposers are able to improve their proposals by adding a value thus making fairer proposals. Such evolutionary aspects are not properly Darwinian-motivated, but they are endowed with a fundamental aspect: they reflect their actions according to value of the offers. Recently, a reactive version of the ultimatum game where acceptance occurs with fixed probability was proposed. In this paper, we aim at exploring this reactive version of the ultimatum game where the acceptance by players depends on the offer. In order to do so, we analyze two situations: (i) mean field and (ii) we consider players inserted within the networks with arbitrary coordination. We then show that the reactive aspect, here studied, thus far not analyzed in the evolutionary game theory literature can unveil an essential feature for the convergence to fifty–fifty split. Moreover we also analyze populations under four different polices ranging from a highly conservative to a moderate one, with respect to the decision in changing the proposal based on acceptances. We show that the idea of gaining less more times added to the reciprocity of the players is highly relevant to the concept of “healthy” societies population bargaining. "

abstract = "Abstract Player Modelling has been receiving much attention from the game community in the recent years. The ability to build accurate models of player behavior can be useful in many aspects of a game. One important aspect is the tracking of a player’s behavior along time, informing every time a change is perceived. This way, the game Artificial Intelligence can adapt itself to better respond to this new behavior. In order to build models of player behavior, researchers frequently resort to Machine Learning techniques. Such methods work on previously recorded game metrics representing player’s interactions with the game environment. However, if the player changes styles over time, the constructed models get out of date. In order to address this drawback, this work proposes the use of and incremental learning technique to track a player’s behavior during his/her interaction with the game environment. Our approach attempts to automatically detect the moments in time when the player changes behavior. We apply a change detection technique from the area of Data Stream Mining that is based on incremental clustering and novelty detection. We also propose three modifications to the original technique, in order to formalize change detection, improve detection rate and reduce detection delay. Simulations were performed considering data produced by the Unreal Tournament game, showing the applicability of the method to online tracking of a player’s behavior and informing whenever behavior changes occur.

Despite the importance of spatial structure in biological collective action, the analysis of n-player games games in spatially structured populations has so far proved elusive. We address this problem by considering mixed strategies and by integrating discrete-action n-player games into the direct fitness approach of social evolution theory. This allows to conveniently identify convergence stable strategies and to capture the effect of population structure by a single structure coefficient, namely, the pairwise (scaled) relatedness among interacting individuals. As an application, we use our mathematical framework to investigate collective action problems associated with the provision of three different kinds of collective goods, paradigmatic of a vast array of helping traits in nature: “public goods” (both providers and shirkers can use the good, e.g., alarm calls), “club goods” (only providers can use the good, e.g., participation in collective hunting), and “charity goods” (only shirkers can use the good, e.g., altruistic sacrifice). We show that relatedness promotes the evolution of collective action in different ways depending on the kind of collective good and its economies of scale. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for relatedness, the kind of collective good, and the economies of scale in theoretical and empirical studies of the evolution of collective action.

More specifically, we develop a function g r that maps impartial combinatorial games to n-tuples called game values. A game value of some impartial combinatorial game G describes the probability that any player can win assuming player r plays randomly (i.e. player r chooses games at random without strategy). After devising our game value function g r , we apply it to the analysis of three-player Chomp whereby the second player plays randomly. Our analysis gives game values for single rowed Chomp positions and two rowed Chomp positions where the bottom row has 1 or 2 elements. We next discuss three alternative methods of analysis. First we extend our game value function to support more than just a single random player. Our second extension allows the random player to choose from an arbitrary distribution over games (as opposed to uniform which is assumed in our analysis of Chomp). This second extension also allows us to model a player who makes correct decisions for “simple” games (those that are, for instance, close to an end game) while playing randomly for more complex games. Finally, the third method considers the case where the random player only makes a mistake with probability ϵ and otherwise plays strategically. We conclude with many open problems and some interesting observations on the behavior of games containing a random player. "

This exploratory study focused on modeling the determinants of actual use of online game playing. Many researchers have shown perceived enjoyment and flow experience as important drivers of actual use of online game playing. The theory of planned behavior has been used in this study. Data were collected from 1584 Universiti Sains Malaysia students with different backgrounds using a structured questionnaire. The findings show that perceived enjoyment has the strongest influence on actual use. Other variables found to influence actual usage include the level of perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, attitude, perceived enjoyment, and flow experience. Implications of this research for future researchers will also be discussed. We hope this research will increase researchers’ interest in further development in this sector and that the model will assist the games industry to identify factors that increase actual use by players.

A structural equation modelling analysis and the FsQCA method were adopted to explore the survey responses of 394 players who were recruited for this study. According to the empirical study results, human–computer interaction (HI), social interaction (SI), skill (S), and challenge (C) independently positive influenced flow experience, and further positively influenced the \{PL\} of mobile game users. This study contributes to the literature on flow theory by elucidating the influence of player behavior on their PL. In particular, the higher the C and \{SI\} are, the more the game challenges experienced players and facilitates interactions with each other, thereby raising PL. "

In the research discussed in this article we investigate to what extent incorporating opponent modelling enhances the performance of case-based adaptive game AI. In our approach, models of the opponent players are generated automatically, on the basis of observations drawn from a multitude of games. We performed experiments that test the enhanced approach in an actual, complex \{RTS\} game, and observed that the effectiveness of case-based adaptive game \{AI\} increases significantly when opponent modelling is incorporated.

Furthermore, commitment has been linked to greater accommodation (i.e., constructive responses) in relationship conflicts. The present study extended the model to the context of multiplayer online games. Participants (N = 176) who regularly played a multiplayer online game completed modified versions of the investment model and accommodation scales in an online questionnaire. Structural equation modeling analyses showed that satisfaction and investment predicted greater game commitment, which in turn predicted greater accommodation toward the game's problems (i.e., lower endorsement of exit behaviors, greater endorsement of voice and loyalty behaviors). Findings showed that the investment model provides a valid framework for examining game commitment. "

In particular, we study simple sequential Bayesian games with unlimited time horizon where two players share a visible scene, but where the tasks (termed assignments) of the players are private information. We present an influence diagram framework for representing simple type of games, where each player holds private information. The framework is used to model the analysis depth and time horizon of the opponent and to determine an optimal policy under various assumptions on analysis depth of the opponent. Not surprisingly, the framework turns out to have severe complexity problems even in simple scenarios due to the size of the relevant past. We propose two approaches for approximation. One approach is to use Limited Memory Influence Diagrams (LIMIDs) in which we convert the influence diagram into a set of Bayesian networks and perform single policy update. The other approach is information enhancement, where it is assumed that the opponent in a few moves will know your assignment. Empirical results are presented using a simple board game. "

Gamification is usually implemented using game elements combined with game mechanics that encourage competition between game players trying to reach some objectives or quantifiable outcome. Most games contain certain common aspects that are frequently created or reinvented for each new game. Solutions to these aspects may vary system to system but they have many commonalities. The concept of design patterns, which so far have proven successful in object-oriented design and software engineering, seeks to communicate these solutions in an easy to understand manner. We extract gamification patterns from known gamified systems and describe them using the Machinations modelling tool and the pattern description scheme. A case study shows how patterns can be used in practice. "

A multivariate analysis of variance evidenced that controls were higher on commitment and in-depth exploration, whereas players were higher on reconsideration of commitment and internet addiction. A structural equation model in which the three identity processes affected simultaneously internet addiction and regular involvement in massively multiplayer online role-playing games showed that reconsideration of commitment was positively associated with internet addiction and the probability to be a player, whereas in-depth exploration was negatively associated only with the probability to be a player. Being a regular player of massively multiplayer online role-playing games seems to be associated with a troubled path in the process of identity formation. "

abstract = "Abstract Smart Farming is a development that emphasizes the use of information and communication technology in the cyber-physical farm management cycle. New technologies such as the Internet of Things and Cloud Computing are expected to leverage this development and introduce more robots and artificial intelligence in farming. This is encompassed by the phenomenon of Big Data, massive volumes of data with a wide variety that can be captured, analysed and used for decision-making. This review aims to gain insight into the state-of-the-art of Big Data applications in Smart Farming and identify the related socio-economic challenges to be addressed. Following a structured approach, a conceptual framework for analysis was developed that can also be used for future studies on this topic. The review shows that the scope of Big Data applications in Smart Farming goes beyond primary production; it is influencing the entire food supply chain. Big data are being used to provide predictive insights in farming operations, drive real-time operational decisions, and redesign business processes for game-changing business models. Several authors therefore suggest that Big Data will cause major shifts in roles and power relations among different players in current food supply chain networks. The landscape of stakeholders exhibits an interesting game between powerful tech companies, venture capitalists and often small start-ups and new entrants. At the same time there are several public institutions that publish open data, under the condition that the privacy of persons must be guaranteed. The future of Smart Farming may unravel in a continuum of two extreme scenarios: 1) closed, proprietary systems in which the farmer is part of a highly integrated food supply chain or 2) open, collaborative systems in which the farmer and every other stakeholder in the chain network is flexible in choosing business partners as well for the technology as for the food production side. The further development of data and application infrastructures (platforms and standards) and their institutional embedment will play a crucial role in the battle between these scenarios. From a socio-economic perspective, the authors propose to give research priority to organizational issues concerning governance issues and suitable business models for data sharing in different supply chain scenarios.

The main focus is on using dynamic fitness landscapes as a mathematical model of coevolutionary game dynamics. Hence, an alternative tool for analyzing coevolutionary games becomes available, and landscape measures such as modality, ruggedness and information content can be computed and analyzed. In addition, fixation properties of the games and quantifiers characterizing the interaction networks are calculated numerically. Relations are established between landscape properties expressed by landscape measures and quantifiers of coevolutionary game dynamics such as fixation probabilities, fixation times and network properties.

Such systems are exponentially more succinct than standard state-transition graphs, as repeated sub-systems are described only once. Early work on model checking of hierarchical systems shows that one can do better than a naive algorithm that “flattens” the system and removes the hierarchy. Given a hierarchical system S and a branching-time specification ψ for it, we reduce the model-checking problem (does S satisfy ψ?) to the problem of solving a hierarchical game obtained by taking the product of S with an alternating tree automaton A ψ for ψ. Our approach leads to clean, uniform, and improved model-checking algorithms for a variety of branching-time temporal logics. In particular, by improving the algorithm for solving hierarchical parity games, we are able to solve the model-checking problem for the μ-calculus in Pspace and time complexity that is only polynomial in the depth of the hierarchy. Our approach also leads to an abstraction-refinement paradigm for hierarchical systems. The abstraction maintains the hierarchy, and is obtained by merging both states and sub-systems into abstract states. "

We present two structural rules, which are formulated similarly to closure rules for tableaux proofs that restrict players' strategies to a mapping between games in extensive forms (i.e., game trees) and proof trees. Both rules are motivated from players' preferences and limitations; they can therefore be viewed as being player-self-imposable. First-order logical consequence is thus shown to result from playing a specific type of argumentation game. The alignment of such games with the normative model of the Pragma-dialectical theory of argumentation is positively evaluated. But explicit rules to guarantee that the argumentation game instantiates first-order logical consequence have now become gratuitous, since their normative content arises directly from players' preferences and limitations. A similar naturalization for non-classical logics is discussed. "

This experimental design uses a mental models approach to examine game features (e.g., controller naturalness), player characteristics (e.g., first person shooter experience, sex, degree of competitiveness) and the game play experience (e.g., perceived game realism, immersion, game failure, frustration and enjoyment) to explain aggressive outcomes. Results from a revised path model suggest perceived realism, immersion, and experience with other first person shooters all positively predicted enjoyment while frustration negatively predicted game enjoyment. Frustration and enjoyment both predicted state aggression. The findings of this study support the application of mental models as a theoretical approach to unify thinking about violent games, contextual features of violent games, individual difference variables and differences in player perceptions and game experiences with regards to outcome aggression. Results are discussed in terms of the model matching hypothesis and implications for the comprehensive study of violent game play, including the importance of enjoyment and frustration, are also discussed.

Even if an exhaustive analytical study of such games between many players may be tricky, numerical experiments highlight interesting asymptotic properties. In particular, we emphasize that randomness plays a key role in concentrating wealth in the extreme, in the hands of a single player. From a mathematical perspective, we interestingly adopt some diffusion limits for small and high-frequency transactions which are otherwise extensively used in population genetics. Finally, the impact of small tax rates on the preceding dynamics is discussed for several regulation mechanisms. We show that taxation of income is not sufficient to overcome this extreme concentration process in contrast to the uniform taxation of capital which stabilizes the economy and prevents agents from being ruined.

These games are in general undecidable and not determined according to the classical definition. We show that such games are determined under a more general notion of winning strategy. We also consider mean-payoff games where the winner can be determined by the winner of a finite cycle-forming game. This yields several decidable classes of mean-payoff games of asymmetric information that require only finite-memory strategies, including a generalization of full-observation games where positional strategies are sufficient. We give an exponential time algorithm for determining the winner of the latter. "

While existing literature on \{EV\} charging demand management has focused on technical aspects and considered EV-owners as utility maximizers, this study proposes a behavioural model incorporating psychological aspects relevant to EV-owners facing charging decisions and interacting with the supplier. The behavioural model represents utility maximization under myopic loss aversion (MLA) within an ultimatum game (UG) framework where the two players are the EV-owner and the electricity supplier. Experimental economics allowed testing the validity of the behavioural model by designing three experiments where a potential EV-owner faces three decisions (i.e., to postpone \{EV\} charging to off-peak periods for a discount proposed by the supplier, the amount of discount to request for off-peak charging at times decided by the supplier, and the amount of discount to accept for supplier-controlled charging) under two contract durations (i.e., short-term, long-term). Findings from the experiments show that indeed potential EV-owners perform charging decisions while being affected by \{MLA\} resulting from monetary considerations and the \{UG\} participation, and that presenting long-term contracts help potential EV-owners to curtail \{MLA\} behaviour and minimise cost even though the assumption of utility maximization is violated.

In this paper, we focus on user strategy selection with respect to information diffusion in generalized networks, and study its evolutionary dynamics and their benefits, as user behavior/interests change over the course of time. We model information diffusion in generalized networks through graphical evolutionary game theory (graphical EGT) and analyze the evolution of the system and its Evolutionary Stable States (ESS) for time-varying fitness values due to time-varying user interests. We perform extensive evaluations based on numerical and simulation results, and study the impact of several parameters on the derived \{ESS\} curves (i.e., \{ESS\} points over time). Such parameters involve user interests and their fitness values, and the degree distributions and network type of the layers of the generalized network. We thoroughly evaluate via numerical analysis and appropriate examples the existence of \{ESS\} loci for the system dynamics depending on the associated parameters. Also, we discuss the relation between (graphical) EGT-based information diffusion analysis and the epidemics-based information diffusion modeling and analysis that is frequently applied in the literature. Our modeling and evaluations can be used to predict the evolution of the cumulative behavior, allowing for efficient design and control of information campaigns. "

This paper formulates a model of the multi-player donor–recipient game considering a multi-recipient scenario. The promotion of cooperation is also studied by introducing a discriminative cooperation strategy into the game, which donates resources to recipients in proportion to their previous donations with a cost for the collection of information. The evolutionary dynamics of individual strategies are explored in homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios by leveraging spatial evolutionary game theory. The results show that in a homogeneous scenario, defectors can dominate the network at the equilibrium state only when the cost-to-benefit ratio ( R ) of donated resources is large. In a heterogeneous scenario, three strategies can coexist all the time within the range of R that was studied, and the promotion of cooperation is more effective when the values of R are smaller. Results from a single node evolution and the formation of local patterns of interaction are provided, and it is analytically shown that discriminators can maintain fairness in resource donation and guarantee long-term cooperation when R is not too large.

As long as the players move in independent parts of the net, they do not know of each other; when they synchronize at a joint transition, each player gets informed of the causal history of the other player. We show that for Petri games with a single environment player and an arbitrary bounded number of system players, deciding the existence of a safety strategy for the system players is EXPTIME-complete.

The nature of their design means that user experience factors make design and/or evaluation difficult using traditional methods commonly used in interactive systems. It is therefore necessary to know how to apply Playability in order to design, analyse, optimise and adapt it to a player’s preferences. In this paper, a strong relationship between user experience (UX) and playability is introduced and justified, a characterisation of player experience (PX) is presented based on playability, and a practical method for player experience assessment is described by using the “Castlevania: Lords of Shadow” video game to be a. The results offers a mechanism for the evaluation (validation and verification) of the quality of the experience and interaction process and acts as a complementary alternative to the traditional tests performed by the video game industry professionals during the Quality Assurance Process (QA Process) to help to share results, reports and have a global point of view to analyse the final game experience.

The probability that an individual moves from its current location is based on the amount of time it has occupied a given position and the relative fitness values of the individual occupying the destination position. Our results show that random movement can promote cooperative behaviour in N -player games. In some circumstances, random mobility enhances system-wide cooperation levels when compared to the static model. However, the outcome is strictly dependent on the cost-to-benefit ratio and the range of movement. An analysis of the population dynamics suggests that the convergence rate of the model (i.e., the time for the population to reach an equilibrium state) is faster with mobility in place. Our findings help to further understand the relationship between mobility and evolving game-playing strategies in spatially structured populations, especially when efficient collective actions matter.

Although current multi-piece failure (MPF) rates are at their lowest in years, there is still room for further improvement by regulating the bat profiles allowed in games. The influence of bat profile tapering was analyzed utilizing finite element models of various known profile geometries to determine the effect on bat durability. LS-DYNA simulations were processed for profiles over a range of maple wood densities that would be currently allowed by \{MLB\} regulations. This paper will describe the various modelling studies conducted to determine the factors that comprise a bat profile of good durability. The results of the modelling are compared to on-field data of bat failures during gameplay of known profiles used by \{MLB\} players. A profile scoring formula is proposed that is a combination of bat geometrical characteristics and bat wood density. This score is shown to be a good predictor of the relative durability of a given set of bat configurations. "

In order to predict the outcome of the game, we model the game states using influence maps. Influence maps are numerical matrices representing the influence of each player’s army in the map, and they are useful for different types of spatial reasoning. We test different machine learning techniques on two different datasets of StarCraft games. The first dataset contains 4-player games in which the players are controlled by the internal game AI. The second dataset contains 2-player human games from specialized websites. We analyze the similarities and differences between both datasets and the performance of each algorithm. Finally, we perform a small experiment with expert players and conclude that our system reaches a level of precision similar to the human judges, although human judges base their predictions on a much more complex and abstract set of game features.

The experimental results point to two different playing contexts: home and mobile, which were evaluated with a gameplay experience questionnaire (GEQ). The \{GEQ\} showed significant difference in negative affect and immersion between mobile and home setting, which are moderated by several influencing contextual factors. This leads us to propose a contextual gameplay experience model that accounts for spatial, temporal, social, cultural, and psychological influences in an external context.

Despite the novelty in audio only gaming, our approach builds on a foundation of several years of research into audio only applications for sight impaired users, augmented reality systems and human–computer interaction studies. In comparison to attempts to provide a realistic user interface, we argue a simple interface enhances both immersion and entertainment value, serendipitously making audio only games practical for mobile computing.

The framework presented allows for deriving beliefs by characterizing the reliability of the signals, and the players’ degree of confidence in these signals. This makes it particularly suitable for games with a large number of heterogenous players. "

In this paper, we study traces collected over a period of one week on the access networks of four different markets serviced by a large \{ISP\} that provides Broadband Fixed Wireless (BFW) access service to users. Based on the amount of traffic generated, its popularity among the subscribers in all the markets, and its sensitivity to Quality of Service (QoS) requirements due to its interactive nature, we identify Counter-Strike, a fast-action game as the application for our study. We discuss player behavior and game traffic behavior in various markets to identify any effects of the migration to broadband services for the last-mile access. We also investigate some of the factors that would influence the provisioning of QoS, namely latency and bandwidth usage. We observe that the distribution of the game playing duration of users’ is heavy-tailed. On the data sets we studied, we found that the latency between the users and the game servers falls below the upper bound suggested by researchers. "

Especially, the problem of associating users to base stations (BSs) and allocating frequency channels must be revised and carefully studied. Finding the optimal solution of such problem is NP-hard. Further, it requires huge amount of information exchange between the BSs. In order to efficiently solve this problem in a distributed manner, we model it using non-cooperative game theory. The proposed game model is proved to not always admit pure Nash equilibria (PNEs), even though simulations show that, for slow fading channels, a \{PNE\} exists for most instances of the game. It is shown that, when the game admits PNEs, its prices of anarchy and stability are close to one. By modifying the players’ actions set and hence obtaining a new game model, we guarantee the existence of \{PNEs\} at the expense of performance degradation. Next, a fully distributed algorithm, based on a learning mechanism, is proposed. It requires no communication between the \{BSs\} and needs only one bit of feedback. Simulations show that the fully distributed algorithm has tight-to-optimal performance and solves efficiently the trade-off between complexity, information exchange and performance. We benchmark the proposed algorithm against the centralized optimal algorithm, the maximum signal to interference-plus-noise ratio algorithm, the best response dynamics algorithm and the randomized weighted majority algorithm.

abstract = "Abstract Bone remodeling is a complex process involving cell–cell interactions, biochemical signaling and mechanical stimuli. Early models of the biological aspects of remodeling were non-spatial and focused on the local dynamics at a fixed location in the bone. Several spatial extensions of these models have been proposed, but they generally suffer from two limitations: first, they are not amenable to analysis and are computationally expensive, and second, they neglect the role played by bone-embedded osteocytes. To address these issues, we developed a novel model of spatial remodeling based on the principles of evolutionary game theory. The analytically tractable framework describes the spatial interactions between zones of bone resorption, bone formation and quiescent bone, and explicitly accounts for regulation of remodeling by bone-embedded, mechanotransducing osteocytes. Using tools from the theory of interacting particle systems we systematically classified the different dynamic regimes of the spatial model and identified regions of parameter space that allow for global coexistence of resorption, formation and quiescence, as observed in physiological remodeling. In coexistence scenarios, three-dimensional simulations revealed the emergence of sponge-like bone clusters. Comparison between spatial and non-spatial dynamics revealed substantial differences and suggested a stabilizing role of space. Our findings emphasize the importance of accounting for spatial structure and bone-embedded osteocytes when modeling the process of bone remodeling. Thanks to the lattice-based framework, the proposed model can easily be coupled to a mechanical model of bone loading. "

At each time during the game, each player holds h cards in hand. Cards are drawn sequentially from a deck and the players should decide whether to play, discard or store them for future use. One of the features of the game is that the players can see their partners' cards but not their own and information must be shared through hints. We introduce a single-player, perfect-information model and show that the game is intractable even for this simplified version where we forego both the hidden information and the multiplayer aspect of the game, even when the player can only hold two cards in her hand. On the positive side, we show that the decision version of the problem—to decide whether or not numbers from 1 through n can be played for every color—can be solved in (almost) linear time for some restricted cases.

Our aim is to understand how likely is it that social outcomes are either those in which preferences dominate choices or those in which some individuals sacrifice their preferences to achieve consensus with others. Our results show that, the stronger individual preferences, the harder to achieve consensus in choices. However, in cases where the payoff ratio is less extreme, full coordination (consensus) is always an equilibrium. Finally, if the level of conflict is low, individual preferences become less relevant and all players choosing what they prefer is not an equilibrium anymore. "

Based on duality theorem of linear programming (LP) and the representation theorem for fuzzy sets, the mean and the lower and upper limits of the TFN-type fuzzy value are easily computed through solving the derived \{LP\} models with data taken from 1-cut set and 0-cut set of fuzzy payoffs.

Moreover, we can easily compute the upper and lower bounds of any Alfa-cut set of the TFN-type fuzzy value for any matrix game with payoffs of \{TFNs\} and players’ optimal mixed strategies through solving the derived \{LP\} models at any specified confidence level Alfa.

The model explains transfer effects with the aid of a trust mechanism that determines how rewards change depending on the dynamics of the interaction between players.

abstract = "Abstract The Elo rating system was originally developed for rating chess players, nowadays it is widely used for ranking players of many other games. The system can be used in educational systems when we interpret student's answer to an item as a match between the student and the item. In this way we can easily dynamically estimate the skill of students and difficulty of items. We provide a systematic overview of different variants of the Elo rating system and their application in education. We compare the Elo rating system to alternative methods and describe a specific case study (an adaptive practice of geography facts) to illustrate the application of the Elo rating system in education. We argue that the Elo rating system is simple, robust, and effective and thus suitable for use in the development of adaptive educational systems. We provide specific guidelines for such applications. "

While prior research has investigated latent motivations as determinants of in-game content purchases, the prior literature has not focused on more concrete reasons to purchase in-game content that stem from how the games are being designed. We form an inventory of reasons (19) to buy in-game content via triangulating from analyses of top-grossing free-to-play games, from a review of existing research, and from industry expert input. These reasons were operationalized into a survey (N = 519). Firstly, we explored how these motivations converged into categories. The results indicated that the purchasing reasons converged into six dimensions: 1) Unobstructed play, 2) Social interaction, 3) Competition, 4) Economical rationale, 5) Indulging the children, and 6) Unlocking content. Secondly, we investigated the relationship between these factors and how much players spend money on in-game content. The results revealed that the purchase motivations of unobstructed play, social interaction, and economical rationale were positively associated with how much money players spend on in-game content. The results imply that the way designers implement artificial limitations and obstacles as well as social interaction affects how much players spend money on in-game content. "

The risk results from a conjunction of natural factors and human activity. Efficient actions against runoff in agricultural watersheds are well known. However they are still difficult to implement as they require co-operation between stakeholders. Local actors thus need tools to help them understand the collective consequences of their individual decisions and help to initiate a process of negotiation between them. We decided to use a participatory approach called companion modelling (ComMod), and, in close collaboration with one of the first group of local stakeholders, to create a role-playing game (RPG) to facilitate negotiations on the future management of erosive runoff. This paper describes and discusses the development of the \{RPG\} and its use with other groups of local stakeholders within the framework of two game sessions organized by two different watershed management committees. During the joint construction step, stakeholders shared their viewpoints about the environment, agents, rules, and how to model runoff in preparation for the creation of the RPG. During the \{RPG\} sessions, two groups of eight players, including farmers, mayors and watershed advisors, were confronted with disastrous runoff in a fictive agricultural watershed. Results showed that they managed to reduce runoff by 20–50% by engaging a dialogue about grass strips, storage ponds and management of the intercrop period. However, further progress is still needed to better control runoff through the implementation of better agricultural practices because, during the \{RPG\} sessions, the watershed advisors did not encourage farmers to do so. Because of the complexity of management problems, results of jointly constructing the game and the \{RPG\} sessions showed that modelling and simulation can be a very useful way of accompanying the collective learning process. This new way of working was welcomed by the participants who expressed their interest in organizing further \{RPG\} sessions. "

A \{DC\} includes four main spaces (Boy, 2005): (1) a rationalization space where the various components of the system being designed (SBD) are described in terms of design rationale, integration and requirements; this space includes declarative and procedural descriptions and statements; (2) an activity space where the current version of the \{SBD\} is displayed; it includes static and dynamic features; this space enables \{SBD\} manipulation; (3) a structure space where the various components and their inter-relations are formally and declaratively described as systems of systems; (4) a function space where the various functions of the \{SBD\} are described in terms of procedural knowledge and dynamic processes involved; this space includes qualitative and quantitative physical and cognitive models. The rationalization space is informed using an adapted version of the \{QOC\} method (Questions, Options, Criteria), which was tested within the I2S-LWR design team. The activity space contains 3D models developed using AutoDesk Inventor, and transferred into the Unity game engine web player in order to facilitate integration within the \{DC\} spaces and enable intuitive manipulation of objects in the activity space. Two additional spaces were added: an instant messaging capability that allows design team members (DTMs) to exchange with one another on a DC; and a structured evaluation space. \{DCs\} are cooperatively created and refined by DTMs, and synthesized during periodic design meetings, the frequency of which may vary. Incrementally combining abstract explanations of designed elements and integration with their explicit visual representation improves mutual understanding among DTMs, and consolidates design decisions. This human-centered design (HCD) approach also improves individual and collective familiarization with the complexity of mixing several expert contributions in \{NPP\} design. In this case, \{HCD\} is not focused on end-users, but rather on the designers themselves. "

Devices are players aiming to find the final positions which achieve a global property of the induced subnetwork. We actually focus on solutions (i.e. Nash equilibria) connecting all the players while minimizing the distances from their home locations. We show that the game always admits a pure Nash equilibrium, and that the convergence after a finite number of improving moves is guaranteed only when players perform their best possible moves; in this case, we provide tight bounds on the speed of convergence to Nash equilibria, both when initial positions are arbitrary and when players start at their home positions. As for the Nash equilibria performances, we first prove that the price of stability is 1 (i.e., an optimal solution is also a Nash equilibrium). Furthermore, we provide tight bounds on the price of anarchy, also showing that better performances are obtained when players start at their home positions. Finally, through extensive experiments, we show that high bounds on the price of anarchy as well as high convergence time of best move dynamics to Nash equilibria are only due to pathological worst cases. Moreover, quite often improving move dynamics (i.e., where players do not necessarily perform a best possible move) converge to Nash equilibria on the tested instances even though the class of instances does not guarantee the convergence.

In this model players have weights (W being the sum of all the player's weights) and there is a critical distance β as well as a link cost α. The cost incurred by a player depends on the cost of establishing links to other players and on the sum of the weights of those players that remain farther than the critical distance. Intuitively, the aim of any player is to be relatively close (at a distance less than β) from the rest of players, mainly of those having high weights. The main features of celebrity games are that: computing the best response of a player is NP-hard if β &gt; 1 and polynomial time solvable otherwise; they always have a pure Nash equilibrium; the family of celebrity games having a connected Nash equilibrium is characterized (the so called star celebrity games) and bounds on the diameter of the resulting equilibrium graphs are given; a special case of star celebrity games shares its set of Nash equilibrium profiles with the MaxBD games with uniform bounded distance β introduced in Bilò et al. [6]. Moreover, we analyze the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and of Stability (PoS) of celebrity games and give several bounds. These are that: for non-star celebrity games PoA = PoS = m a x { 1 , W / α } ; for star celebrity games PoS = 1 and PoA = O ( m i n { n / β , W α } ) but if the Nash Equilibrium is a tree then the PoA is O ( 1 ) ; finally, when β = 1 the PoA is at most 2. The upper bounds on the PoA are complemented with some lower bounds for β = 2 . "

However these games do not normally consider the reasoning abilities of players. One solution is to use formal logics which allow for modeling the reasoning abilities of agents as well as allowing formal reasoning about certain properties of games such as the solution of games. In this paper, we propose an epistemic logic to study strategic games with incomplete information. In this logic we can for instance precisely describe what the requirements and consequences of informative actions are in the cloud services scenario. We can reason what rational agents should do if they can choose between different available actions. In addition, this language can be used as a semantically well-defined query language for model checkers to automatically verify the game descriptions with respect to their intended specifications. "

While better players showed greater activation in one region (right dorsal striatum) their relative skill was better diagnosed by considering the sequential structure of whole brain activation. Using a cognitive model that played this game, we extracted a characterization of the mental states that are involved in playing a game and the statistical structure of the transitions among these states. There was a strong correspondence between this measure of sequential structure and the skill of different players. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis, it was possible to recognize, with relatively high accuracy, the cognitive states participants were in during particular scans. We used the sequential structure of these activation-recognized states to predict the skill of individual players. These findings indicate that important features about information-processing strategies can be identified from a model-based analysis of the sequential structure of brain activation. "

abstract = "Abstract Despite the huge growth potential that has been predicted for in-app purchases and the mobile game market, little is known about what motivates game players to make such purchases. The purpose of this paper is to build a research model based on the loyalty literature and studies of value theory to identify the antecedents of in-app purchase intention in the context of mobile games. The proposed model was empirically evaluated using a web survey of 3309 mobile game players: 813 nonpaying players and 2496 paying players. Structural equation modeling was used to assess the research model. The results reveal that loyalty to the mobile game has significant influence on a player’s intention to make an in-app purchase. The perceived values of the game (playfulness, connectedness, access flexibility, and reward) have direct influence on the loyalty of all players but appear to have relatively little impact on the purchase intentions of nonpaying players. Two values (loyalty and good price) were found to have a direct impact on a player’s intention to make an in-app purchase. Specifically, our study revealed differences between paying users and nonpaying users. This study provides a better understanding of how the values influence loyalty among all players of the game, and the purchase intentions of paying and nonpaying players. Further insights into mobile game app marketing strategies are provided as well. "

Consistent with the social identity model of deindividuation effects (SIDE), the anonymity of online games may engender endorsement of group-consistent attitudes and amplification of social stereotyping, such as the adherence to gender norms predicted by expectations states theory. A 2 × 3 × 2 virtual field experiment (N = 520) in an online first-person shooter video game examined effects of a confederate players’ sex, communication style, and skill on players’ compliance with subsequent online friend requests. We found support for the hypothesis that, in general, women would gain more compliance with friend requests than men. We also found support for the hypothesis that women making positive utterances would gain more compliance with friend requests than women making negative utterances, whereas men making negative utterances would gain more compliance with friend requests than men making positive utterances. The hypothesis that player skill (i.e., game scores) would predict compliance with friend requests was not supported. Implications for male and female game players and computer-mediated communication in online gaming environments are discussed. "

abstract = "Abstract In soccer, the bicycle kick has provided viewers moments of breathtaking spectacle that seem virtuosic in scope. The novelty of such moments is underscored by the rarity with which players have performed this complex skill during national or international tournaments. The rarity of these occurrences is both a product of perceptions that it is a high-risk, low return skill and by the fact that there is a dearth of scientific research on the biomechanics of the technique. Two genera can be discerned based on starting position: 1) back-facing the goal, and 2) side-facing the goal. The current study, using 3D motion capture technology and full-body biomechanical modeling, identifies elements that govern entrainment of the technique by examining jumping, kicking and falling phases of the skill execution. Motor sequencing during the first two phases can be characterized by analyzing the following parameters: 1) angle between the player’s thighs (humerus bones) upon take-off, 2) the whip-like control of the kicking leg, 3) timing between ball motion and joint coordination and, for the side-facing bicycle kick, 4) rotation of the player’s trunk during the jumping phase. Dispersion of energy during falling after the kick is accomplished by sharing the load using a sequence of partial landings. Collectively, this information could help entrainment of the skill. Virtuosic in appearance, more frequent use of the kick can only enhance the excitement of the game. "

This “self-design” approach uses role playing games and agent based modelling to let participants design their own conceptual framework, and so modelling supports, of issues. The method has a multi-scale focus I order to enable the whole multi-scale Sahelian logic to be expressed and on the other hand to encourage the players to deal with possible region-wide changes implied by their “local” policy objectives. This multi-level participatory design of land use policies has been under experimentation in Senegal since 2008 in different local and national arenas. The process has resulted in the “self-design” of a qualitative and relatively simple model of Sahelian uncertainty, which can be played like a role playing game as well a computerized model. Results are shown in perceptible autonomous organisational learning at the local level. Participants were also able to incorporate their own ideas for new rules for access to resources. They designed innovative collective rules, organised follow up and monitoring of these new land uses. Moreover, meaningful ideas for environmental policies are beginning to take shape. This work raises the epistemological question of what is meant by the term “indigenous knowledge” in environmental management, ranging from knowledge based on practical experience being included in the scholar's framing of knowledge, to a legitimate local ability to contextualize and re-arrange scientific expertise, to profoundly different worldviews which do not match ours.

To unravel this evolutionary riddle, several models have been developed within the theoretical framework of spatial game theory, focussing on the interactions between two general classes of player, “cooperators” and “defectors”. Generally, explicit movement in the spatial domain is not considered in these models, with strategies moving via imitation or through colonisation of neighbouring sites. We present here a spatially explicit stochastic individual-based model in which pure cooperators and defectors undergo random motion via diffusion and also chemotaxis guided by the gradient of a semiochemical. Individual movement rules are derived from an underlying system of reaction-diffusion-taxis partial differential equations which describes the dynamics of the local number of individuals and the concentration of the semiochemical. Local interactions are governed by the payoff matrix of the classical prisoner's dilemma, and accumulated payoffs are translated into offspring. We investigate the cases of both synchronous and non-synchronous generations. Focussing on an ecological scenario where defectors are parasitic on cooperators, we find that random motion and semiochemical sensing bring about self-generated patterns in which resident cooperators and parasitic defectors can coexist in proportions that fluctuate about non-zero values. Remarkably, coexistence emerges as a genuine consequence of the natural tendency of cooperators to aggregate into clusters, without the need for them to find physical shelter or outrun the parasitic defectors. This provides further evidence that spatial clustering enhances the benefits of mutual cooperation and plays a crucial role in preserving cooperative behaviours. "

We first present an analysis of the behavior of children playing traditional tag games. Based on these observations, we designed the Interactive Tag Playground (ITP), an interactive installation that uses tracking and floor projections to enhance the game of tag. We evaluate the \{ITP\} in one user study with adults and one with children. We compare players’ reported experiences when playing both traditional and interactive tag. Players report significantly higher engagement and immersion when playing interactive tag. We also use tracking data collected automatically to quantitatively analyze player behavior in both tag games. Players exhibit similar patterns of physical activity and interactions in both game types. We can therefore conclude that interactive technology can be used to make traditional games more engaging, without losing social and physical character of the game. "

Personal mobility carbon allowance (PMCA) schemes allocate carbon credits to users at no cost based on the emissions reduction goal of the system. Users spend carbon credits for travel and a market place exists where users can buy or sell credits. To understand this process, a real-time experimental game tool is developed where players are asked to make travel decisions within the carbon budget set by \{PMCA\} and they are allowed to trade carbon credits in a market modeled as a double auction game. Results from estimated random parameter models show that medium and low income group users are highly sensitive to increase in carbon cost for grocery (non-work) trips. Further, the elasticity values show that high income group are less sensitive to carbon cost increase for work trips. The market dynamics such as number of total bids or asks are examined through count data models. The insights from the models can be used to effectively design the parameters of \{PMCA\} schemes. In addition, the experimental game tool and the analysis framework can be applied to understand other market based strategies such as carbon tax and tradable emissions permits. "

The results indicate that the perceived congruity of \{IGA\} reduces the perceived intrusiveness of the \{IGA\} and positively contributes to the perceived realism of the fantasy game. Intrusiveness and realism, in turn, influence players’ attitude towards the \{IGA\} and their play intention of the fantasy game. Whilst the positive effect of perceived congruity through intrusiveness is reinforced by the perceived interactivity of the IGA, the effect of perceived congruity through realism is attenuated by perceived interactivity.

The model is described by a system of ordinary differential equations which depends on players payoff functions, as well as on the adjacency matrix of the underlying graph. Since the number of differential equations increases with the number of vertices in the graph, the analysis of \{EGN\} becomes hard for large graphs. Building on the notion of lumpability for Markov chains, we identify conditions on the network structure allowing to reduce the original graph. In particular, we identify a partition of the vertex set of the graph and show that players in the same block of a lumpable partition have equivalent dynamical behaviors, whenever their payoff functions and initial conditions are equivalent. Therefore, vertices belonging to the same partition block can be merged into a single vertex, giving rise to a reduced graph and consequently to a simplified system of equations. We also introduce a tighter condition, called strong lumpability, which can be used to identify dynamical symmetries in \{EGN\} which are related to the interchangeability of players in the system. "

Mild Traumatic Brain Injury, concussion, widely occurs in American football because of the frequent strokes to players’ heads. Concussion includes several types of neurological dysfunctions such as headache, dizziness, confusion, blurred vision, delayed reaction time and etc. Lots of the studies have focused on understanding the concussion and improving the protective performance of the helmet, so that the dose of the injury in players is reduced. Researches in this area can be classified as two major methods: experimental studies and Finite Element Modeling (FEM) simulations. In experiments, researchers have tried to record head impacts or reconstruct the severe collisions using the game videos in the laboratory conditions. They have used the Hybrid \{III\} dummy in order to study the effects of the different impact parameters such as direction, velocity, region of the head being hit and etc. These studies have been done by analyzing the dynamic responses of head including linear acceleration (LA), rotational acceleration (RA), and different head injury criteria like Head Injury Criteria (HIC) and Gadd Severity Index (GSI). Mentioned impact parameters have been also examined using \{FEM\} simulations. Researchers have applied the results of experimental tests including linear and rotational acceleration in order to study the brain deformation responses to different types of impacts. In this regards, brain deformation responses like maximum principal strain have been considered and analyzed using the head injury and concussion thresholds. "

In this work the \{PD\} is studied in a one-dimensional lattice, where each cell represents a player, which in turn can interact with the neighbors playing the \{PD\} (cooperate or defect). The update of states adopts the Pavlovian Evolutionary Strategy (PES) or Darwinian Evolutionary Strategy (DES). Adopting PES, if a player receives a positive payoff greater than his/her aspiration level, he/she keeps the current state, and switches otherwise. Adopting DES, player compares his/her payoff with payoff of opponents. If it is not the highest, he/she copies the state of fittest player, switching the state if it is different of his/her current state. The critical temptation values obtained analytically are reported, and the cluster patterns that emerge from the interactions among the players are shown. Also we defined analytical functions that calculate the maximum/minimum size of defective/cooperative clusters. Also, the parameter space is explored with exhaustive computational simulations, which confirm the analytical results and reinforce that Pavlovian strategy foments cooperation among players. In steady state, system can reach the cooperative or quasi-regular phases, when adopting the PES, and cooperative, defective or chaotic phases, adopting the DES. The new quasi-regular phase occurs when several players switch their states in each round, but the proportion of cooperators does not show significant variation. Additionally, the present work shows that the lowest temptation level (T=1) may be considered a trivial case only for the particular case where the players interact with only one neighbor, otherwise system presents the same features that for higher temptation values.

Here I focus on the capacity of the inclusive fitness approach to effectively handle non-additive or synergistic interactions. I work with a binary interaction with the matrix game [ a b c d ] and I restrict attention to transitive (homogeneous) populations with weak selective effects. First of all I observe that the construction of “higher-order” relatedness coefficients permits these synergistic interactions to be analyzed with an inclusive fitness analysis. These coefficients are an immediate generalization of Hamilton׳s original coefficient and can be calculated with exactly the same type of recursive equations. Secondly I observe that for models in which the population is not too large and local genetic renewal is rare (e,g, rare mutation), these higher order coefficients are not needed even with non-additive interactions; in fact the synergistic interaction is entirely equivalent to a closely-related additive one. The overall conclusion is that in the study of synergistic binary social interactions (2-player games) in a finite homogeneous population with weak selection and rare genetic renewal, a standard inclusive-fitness analysis is able to predict the direction of allele-frequency change. I apply this result to analyze a recent model of Allen and Nowak (2015). "

At each stage, a player does not know what action the other player will take, but otherwise knows the full state of the game. This formalism has been used to express games in general game playing and can also model many discrete approximations of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we describe both novel and existing algorithms that compute strategies for the class of two-player zero-sum simultaneous move games. The algorithms include exact backward induction methods with efficient pruning, as well as Monte Carlo sampling algorithms. We evaluate the algorithms in two different settings: the offline case, where computational resources are abundant and closely approximating the optimal strategy is a priority, and the online search case, where computational resources are limited and acting quickly is necessary. We perform a thorough experimental evaluation on six substantially different games for both settings. For the exact algorithms, the results show that our pruning techniques for backward induction dramatically improve the computation time required by the previous exact algorithms. For the sampling algorithms, the results provide unique insights into their performance and identify favorable settings and domains for different sampling algorithms. "

We focus on two classes of games: (1) aggregative games with strategic substitutes and (2) nice aggregative games, where payoff functions are continuous and concave in own strategies. We provide simple sufficient conditions under which positive shocks to individual players increase their own actions and have monotone effects on the aggregate. The results are illustrated with applications to public good provision, contests, Cournot competition and technology choices in oligopoly. "

We add to the literature by expanding the application of mathematical models and applying an Equilibrium Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC), which is used to model multi-leader–follower games, to a spatial market. Using our model, we investigate the prevalent market setting in the international market for metallurgical coal between 2008 and 2010, whose market characteristics provide arguments for a wide variety of market structures. Using different statistical measures to compare model results with actual market outcomes, we find that two previously neglected settings perform best: First, a setting in which the four largest metallurgical coal exporting firms compete against each other as Stackelberg leaders, while the remainders act as Cournot followers.

In this model, we cannot interchange the identities of the players without interchanging the payoff of the strategies. This model differs from the symmetric model, where each player has two different choices from the two choices of the other one. We consider that the round of the game is infinitely repeated (infinitely repeated and asymmetric 2×2 game). The payoff matrix corresponding to all possible strategies of the game is obtained. Furthermore, we will apply the resulting matrix in two examples. During this, we will draw the attention towards the behavior of some of the strategies and the evolutionary stability. "

Preparing land, finding seeds, tending crops, responding to the land's needs—across the planet, human players simulate many of the same choices faced by the world's real-life farmers. These millions, though using simulation models, do not pursue their agricultural goals for an academic purpose. Rather, driven by human curiosity and the desire to connect to others, they are playing computer games with names like “Farmville”, “Happy Farm”, and “Farm Town.” Using the rapidly emerging social media framework, these are among the most popular games devised in all of human history. Meanwhile, academics labour to schedule playing sessions for their carefully crafted real-world land-use simulation models. What if these two worlds could be combined, with millions of people acting as agents in academically informative land-use models? This paper compares the characteristics of the world's most popular social media farming games to agent-based agricultural land use models produced in academia. We describe how the multiplayer aspect of social media games can inform and improve existing scientific models, and propose a framework for merging these technologies to create “massively multi-player land use models”, or MMLUMs. Such models require no significant technical breakthroughs, but rather a reconception of the representation of space and of player management that already is present in academic models. Accessed by millions through social media, such hybrid academic/gaming models could quickly make significant contributions to scientific understanding of agricultural land use dynamics. More broadly, a functioning \{MMLUM\} game, even if only moderately successful by online gaming standards, could help researchers from many fields address a very wide host of vital questions about Earth's future.

According to that assumption, the game is transformed from the symmetric three- player model to asymmetric two-player model such that, the identities of the players cannot be interchanged without interchanging the payoff of the strategies. Each strategy in the resulting model is expressed with two state automata. We determine the payoff matrix corresponding to the all possible strategies. We noticed that, for some strategies, it is better to be a player of the first type (independent player) than being of the second type (allies). "

Northern white ash had been the wood of choice until the introduction of hard maple in the late 1990s. Since the introduction of maple to the game, there was a perceived increase in the rate of bats to exhibit multiple piece failures (MPF)—both ash and maple. These failures introduced a new aspect to the game that can be a significant factor during play, i.e. pieces of bats going into the field of play, thereby distracting fielders while reacting to the batted ball. Observations of bat breakage in the field and lab testing of bats in controlled conditions have shown the bat durability is a function of wood quality and bat profile. Wood quality is described by the density and the slope of grain of the wood used in the bat. The density and the slope of grain determine the effective strength of the wood. The bat profile is described by the variation in the diameter of the bat along its length. The wood densities and bat profiles which are preferred by players, are typically in direct contradiction with what makes for a durable bat. In this paper, the finite element method is used to develop calibrated models of the breaking of wood bats in controlled lab conditions. The modeling approach is then used to explore how bat profile influences bat durability and what potential changes can be made in bat profile to satisfy player desires while increasing bat durability.

abstract = "Abstract It is well-known that individual diversity is a typical feature within the collective population. To model this kind of characteristics, we propose an evolutionary model of public goods game with two types of players (named as A and B), where players are located on the sites of a square lattice satisfying the periodic boundary conditions. The evolution of the strategy distribution is governed by iterated strategy adoption from a randomly selected neighbor with a probability, which not only depends on the payoff difference between players, but also on the type of the neighbor. For B-type agents, we pose a pre-factor ( 0 &lt; w &lt; 1 ) to the strategy transfer probability, which implies the lower teaching activity or strategy convincing performance; but w is always set to be 1 for A-type agents, hence it means that A-type players are influential ones who own a larger strategy spreading chance. Furthermore, we also consider the competition between two opposite effects when the number of nearest neighbors ( k ) is increased from 4 to 24. Within a range of the portion of A-type influential players, the inhomogeneous teaching activity in strategy transfer yields a relevant increase (dependent on w ) in the density of cooperators characterizing the promotion of cooperation. Current findings are of utmost importance for us to understand the evolution of cooperation under many real-world circumstances, such as the natural, biological, economic and even social systems. "

The games have shown promise in solving a variety of problems, which computer computation has been unable to resolve completely thus far. In this study, we consider generalized \{ESP\} games with two objectives. First, we propose an analytical model for computing the utility of generalized \{ESP\} games, where the number of players, the consensus threshold, and the stopping condition are variable. We show that our model can accurately predict the stopping condition that will yield the optimal utility of a generalized \{ESP\} game under a specific game setting. A service provider can therefore utilize the model to ensure that the hosted generalized \{ESP\} games produce high-quality labels efficiently. Second, we propose a metric, called system gain, for evaluating the performance of ESP-like \{GWAP\} systems, and also use analysis to study the properties of generalized \{ESP\} games. We believe that \{GWAP\} systems should be designed and played with strategies. To this end, we implement an optimal puzzle selection strategy (OPSA) based on our analysis. Using a comprehensive set of simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed \{OPSA\} approach can effectively improve the system gain of generalized \{ESP\} games, as long as the number of puzzles in the system is sufficiently large.

Often most of the players are individually insignificant, and are effective in the game only via coalitions. At the same time there may exist big players who retain the power to wield single-handed influence. The interactions are modeled as cooperative games with a continuum of players. In general, the continuum consists of a non-atomic part (the “ocean”), along with (at most countably many) atoms. The continuum provides a convenient framework for mathematical analysis, and approximates the results for large finite games well. Also, it enables a unified view of games with finite, countable, or oceanic player-sets, or indeed any mixture of these.The value is defined as a map from a space of cooperative games to payoffs that satisfies the classical value axioms: additivity (linearity), efficiency, symmetry and positivity. The chapter introduces many spaces for which there exists a unique value, as well as other spaces on which there is a value.A game with infinitely many players can be considered as a limit of finite games with a large number of players. The chapter studies limiting values which are defined by means of the limits of the Shapley value of finite games that approximate the given game with infinitely many players.Various formulas for the value which express the value as an average of marginal contribution are studied. These value formulas capture the idea that the value of a player is his expected marginal contribution to a perfect sample of size t of the set of all players where the size t is uniformly distributed on [0,1]. In the case of smooth games the value formula is a diagonal formula: an integral of marginal contributions which are expressed as partial derivatives and where the integral is over all perfect samples of the set of players. The domain of the formula is further extended by changing the order of integration and derivation and the introduction of a well-crafted infinitesimal perturbation of the perfect samples of the set of players provides a value formula that is applicable to many additional games with essential nondifferentiabilities.

abstract = "Abstract Animals can often coordinate their actions to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. However, this can result in a social dilemma when uncertainty about the behavior of partners creates multiple fitness peaks. Strategies that minimize risk (“risk dominant”) instead of maximizing reward (“payoff dominant”) are favored in economic models when individuals learn behaviors that increase their payoffs. Specifically, such strategies are shown to be “stochastically stable” (a refinement of evolutionary stability). Here, we extend the notion of stochastic stability to biological models of continuous phenotypes at a mutation-selection-drift balance. This allows us to make a unique prediction for long-term evolution in games with multiple equilibria. We show how genetic relatedness due to limited dispersal and scaled to account for local competition can crucially affect the stochastically-stable outcome of coordination games. We find that positive relatedness (weak local competition) increases the chance the payoff dominant strategy is stochastically stable, even when it is not risk dominant. Conversely, negative relatedness (strong local competition) increases the chance that strategies evolve that are neither payoff nor risk dominant. Extending our results to large multiplayer coordination games we find that negative relatedness can create competition so extreme that the game effectively changes to a hawk–dove game and a stochastically stable polymorphism between the alternative strategies evolves. These results demonstrate the usefulness of stochastic stability in characterizing long-term evolution of continuous phenotypes: the outcomes of multiplayer games can be reduced to the generic equilibria of two-player games and the effect of spatial structure can be analyzed readily.

We give conditions on reactivity and marginal costs under which the solution converges to the Cournot–Nash equilibrium. Moreover, we compare the stability regions of the proposed oligopoly to a similar one, in which the \{LMA\} firm is replaced by a best response firm, which is more rational than the \{LMA\} firm. We show that, depending on costs ratio, the equilibrium can lose its stability in two different ways, through both a flip and a Neimark–Sacker bifurcation. We show that the nonlinear, noninvertible map describing the model can give rise to several coexisting stable attractors (multistability). We analytically investigate the shape of the basins of attractions, in particular proving the existence of regions known in the literature as lobes. "

In this manuscript we derive the composition of a many-player multiple strategy system in the mutation–selection equilibrium. This results in a simple expression which can be obtained by recursions using coalescence theory.

In this study, we examine the relationship between gaming gratifications and genre preferences on the basis of a multivariate model deduced from previous research. We applied this model to survey data from a representative sample of 4500 gamers. We found that, apart from socio-demographics, individual and content-related gratifications are relevant predictors for genre preferences, especially for “core-gamer” genres such as roleplaying or action and shooter games. Beyond the “core-gamer”, there is large group of (older) casual players who prefer puzzle and simulation games and seek fewer and different gratifications from computer gaming. "

Their interrelations correspond to alternative behavior, namely, cooperation, non-cooperation and competition, while they are large-scale spatially distributed systems combining multiple means of transportation and the infrastructure and equipment typically utilized for servicing demand, results to a complex system integration. In this paper, the case of the optimal design of freight networks is investigated, aiming to highlight the particularities emerging in this case of transportation facilities strategic and/or operational planning and the multiple game-theoretic and equilibrium problems that are structured in cascade and in hierarchies. The application that is investigated here focuses in the design of a significant ‘player’ of the freight supply chain, namely container terminals, while the proposed framework will aim on analyzing investment strategies built on integrated demand–supply models and the optimal network design format. The approach will build on the multilevel Mathematical Programming with Equilibrium Constraints (MPECs) formulation, but is further extended to cope with the properties introduced by the ‘designers’ (infrastructure authorities), shippers and carriers competition in all levels of MPECs. Since container terminals are typically competing each other, the nomenclature used here for formulating appropriate \{MPECs\} problems are based on hierarchies of Variational Inequalities (VI) problems, able to capture the alternative relationships emerging in realistic freight supply chains. The proposed formulations of the competitive network design case is addressed by a novel approach of co-evolutionary agents, which can be regarded as new in equilibrium estimation. Finally, the results are compared with alternative network design cases, namely the centralized cooperative and exchanging design. Under this analysis it is able to highlight the differences among alternative design cases, but moreover an estimation of the ‘price of anarchy’ in transportation systems design is offered, an element of both theoretical as well as practical relevance.

They interacted with various genres of games, including action games, puzzle games, casual games, and narratively complex games, several of which were rated as “mature” games, intended only for adult players. Qualitative data was collected in the form of videos taken during the gameplay, in focus group interviews immediately following the gameplay, and in follow-up surveys conducted several weeks later. Quantitative data was collected in the form of a self-reported emotional reaction assessment tool based on the pleasure-arousal-dominance emotional state model. "

The key achievements of the paper are to provide the dominance regions and to show that an analysis of dominance provides a complete solution to the game. This paper also presents a study of the effects of obstacles by comparing the dominance regions in the presence and absence of obstacles. The obstacles considered include line segments and polygons as well as obstacles that have asymmetric effects on the players. As part of the discussion, a novel, multiplayer pursuit–evasion game is also presented. It features three players on two teams, and it can be used to model rescue scenarios and biological behaviors. The solution of this game cannot be determined from the previous literature, but the methods provided in this paper are used to determine dominance and solve the game. "

We show that \{AGGs\} can be used to compactly represent all games that are compact when represented as graphical games, symmetric games, anonymous games, congestion games, and polymatrix games, as well as games that require exponential space under all of these existing representations. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a player's expected utility under an arbitrary mixed-strategy profile, and show how to use this algorithm to achieve exponential speedups of existing methods for computing sample Nash equilibria. We present results of experiments showing that using \{AGGs\} leads to a dramatic increase in the size of games accessible to computational analysis.22We gratefully acknowledge Moshe Tennenholtz for his co-authorship of a paper on Local Effect Games (Leyton-Brown and Tennenholtz, 2003), an action-centric graphical model for games that inspired our work on AGGs.

Positional data of three pairs of skilled female badminton players (average age 20.5 ± 1.38 years) were captured and analyzed. Local correlation coefficient, which provides information on the relationship of players’ displacement data, between each pair of players was computed for angle and distance from base position. Speed scalar product was in turn established from speed vectors of the players. The results revealed two patterns of playing behaviors (i.e., in-phase and anti-phase patterns) for movement displacement. Anti-phase relation was the dominant coupling pattern for speed scalar relationships among the pairs of players. Speed scalar product, as a collective variable, was different between cooperative and competitive plays with a greater variability in amplitude seen in competitive plays leading to a winning point. The findings from this study provide evidence for increasing stroke variability to perturb existing stable patterns of play and highlights the potential for speed scalar product to be a collective variable to distinguish different patterns of play (e.g., cooperative and competitive).

In static entry games, we test the theory of global games which posits that players play games of complete information as if they were playing a related global game of incomplete information. By contrast, in dynamic n-period entry games, the efficient subgame perfect equilibrium prediction is for all to enter whenever the payoff relevant state variable exceeds a certain threshold. The subgame perfect entry threshold of the dynamic game will generally differ from the global game threshold of the static version of the same game. Nevertheless, our experimental findings suggest that entry thresholds are similar between static and dynamic versions of the same game. An implication is that the modeling of entry games with strategic complementarities as static, one-shot games – ignoring the dynamic element of such interactions – may not be unreasonable. "

abstract = "Abstract In game theory the interaction among players obligates each player to develop a belief about the possible strategies of the other players, to choose a best-reply given those beliefs, and to look for an adjustment of the best-reply and the beliefs using a learning mechanism until they reach an equilibrium point. Usually, the behavior of an individual cost-function, when such best-reply strategies are applied, turns out to be non-monotonic and concluding that such strategies lead to some equilibrium point is a non-trivial task. Even in repeated games the convergence to a stationary equilibrium is not always guaranteed. The best-reply strategies analyzed in this paper represent the most frequent type of behavior applied in practice in problems of bounded rationality of agents considered within the Artificial Intelligence research area. They are naturally related with the, so-called, fixed-local-optimal actions or, in other words, with one step-ahead optimization algorithms widely used in the modern Intelligent Systems theory. This paper shows that for an ergodic class of finite controllable Markov games the best-reply strategies lead necessarily to a Lyapunov/Nash equilibrium point. One of the most interesting properties of this approach is that an expedient (or absolutely expedient) behavior of an ergodic system (repeated game) can be represented by a Lyapunov-like function non-decreasing in time. We present a method for constructing a Lyapunov-like function: the Lyapunov-like function replaces the recursive mechanism with the elements of the ergodic system that model how players are likely to behave in one-shot games. To show our statement, we first propose a non-converging state-value function that fluctuates (increases and decreases) between states of the Markov game. Then, we prove that it is possible to represent that function in a recursive format using a one-step-ahead fixed-local-optimal strategy. As a result, we prove that a Lyapunov-like function can be built using the previous recursive expression for the Markov game, i.e., the resulting Lyapunov-like function is a monotonic function which can only decrease (or remain the same) over time, whatever the initial distribution of probabilities. As a result, a new concept called Lyapunov games is suggested for a class of repeated games. Lyapunov games allow to conclude during the game whether the applied strategy provides the convergence to an equilibrium point (or not). The time for constructing a Potential (Lyapunov-like) function is exponential. Our algorithm tractably computes the Nash, Lyapunov and the correlated equilibria: a Lyapunov equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium, as well it is also a correlated equilibrium. Validity of the proposed method is successfully demonstrated both theoretically and practically by a simulated experiment related to the Duel game. "

More specifically, for any two-player game, we give a simple construction of a three-player game whose Nash equilibria (even under repetition) correspond to those of the one-shot two-player game. Combined with recent computational hardness results for one-shot two-player normal-form games (Daskalakis et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2007), this gives our main result: the problem of finding an (epsilon) Nash equilibrium in a given n × n × n game (even when all payoffs are in { − 1 , 0 , 1 } ) is PPAD-hard (under randomized reductions).

To counteract such potential effects, we explore the moderating role of avatar self-relevance in avatar-induced stereotype threat effects. Specifically, we examine how avatar customization (i.e., designing an avatar) and avatar-body connection (i.e., the perception that the avatar is incorporated into body schema) interact with avatar gender to influence user’s post-game behavior in ways that conform to gendered stereotypes. In an experimental study (N = 64, all female), participants completed a competitive math task after playing a digital sword-fighting game. For participants who customized an avatar and experienced low avatar embodiment, those who used male avatar performed better at the math task than those who used a female avatar. These findings extend our understanding of avatar use effects, especially as they relate to avatar self-relevance, avatar customization, avatar embodiment, and stereotype threat, thereby providing insights into the ways that digital games can be designed to maximize positive outcomes for players in a variety of meaningful contexts.

This work presents a decentralized, real-time algorithm for cooperative pursuit of a single evader by multiple pursuers in bounded, simply-connected planar domains. The algorithm is based on minimizing the area of the generalized Voronoi partition of the evader. The pursuers share state information but compute their inputs independently. No assumptions are made about the evader’s control strategies other than requiring the evader control inputs to conform to a speed limit. Proof of guaranteed capture is shown when the domain is convex and the players’ motion models are kinematic. Simulation results are presented showing the efficiency and effectiveness of this strategy. "

For a weighted game we say that a power index satisfies local monotonicity if a player who controls a large share of the total weight vote does not have less power than a player with a smaller voting weight. In (Holler, 1982) Manfred Holler introduced the Public Good index. In its unnormalized version, i.e., the raw measure, it counts the number of times that a player belongs to a minimal winning coalition. Unlike the Banzhaf index, it does not count the remaining winning coalitions in which the player is crucial. Holler noticed that his index does not satisfy local monotonicity, a fact that can be seen either as a major drawback (Felsenthal &amp; Machover, 1998, 221 ff.)or as an advantage (Holler &amp; Napel 2004). In this paper we consider a convex combination of the two indices and require the validity of local monotonicity. We prove that the cost of obtaining it is high, i.e., the achievable new indices satisfying local monotonicity are closer to the Banzhaf index than to the Public Good index. All these achievable new indices are more solidary than the Banzhaf index, which makes them as very suitable candidates to divide a public good. As a generalization we consider convex combinations of either: the Shift index, the Public Good index, and the Banzhaf index, or alternatively: the Shift Deegan–Packel, Deegan–Packel, and Johnston indices.

Such excluded regressors arise in various empirical contexts. Our identification method is constructive, and provides a basis for nonparametric estimators. For a semiparametric model with linear payoffs, we propose root-N consistent and asymptotically normal estimators for players’ payoffs.

The concepts of dominance and equivalence of strategies are examined in the context of this game, before focusing on the more specific case of the game played over a graph. Methods are presented to simplify the analysis of such games, both by means of the iterated elimination of dominated strategies and through consideration of automorphisms of the graph. Lower and upper bounds on the value of the game are presented and optimal mixed strategies are calculated for games played over a particular family of graphs. "

The leader acts first to select a set of items, and with knowledge of the leader’s action, the follower then selects another subset of items. There exists a set of clauses, where each clause is a prioritized set of items. A clause is satisfied by the selected item having the highest priority, resulting in a reward for the player that introduced the highest-priority selected item. We examine a mixed-integer bilevel programming (MIBLP) formulation for a competitive set covering problem, assuming that both players seek to maximize their profit. This class of problems arises in several fields, including non-cooperative product introduction and facility location games. We develop an \{MIBLP\} model for this problem in which binary decision variables appear in both stages of the model. Our contribution regards a cutting-plane algorithm, based on inequalities that support the convex hull of feasible solutions and induce faces of non-zero dimension in many cases. Furthermore, we investigate alternative verification problems to equip the algorithm with cutting planes that induce higher-dimensional faces, and demonstrate that the algorithm significantly improves upon existing general solution method for MIBLPs.

We provide conditions for which the contagious strategy (Kandori, 1992) sustains a social norm of cooperation among all M players. Our main finding is that if agents are sufficiently patient, a social norm of society-wide cooperation becomes easier to sustain under the contagious strategy as n increases toward M. In an experiment where the population size M is fixed and conditions identified by our theoretical analysis hold, we find strong evidence that cooperation rates are higher with larger group sizes than with smaller group sizes in treatments where each subject interacts with M − 1 robot players who follow the contagious strategy. When the number of human subjects increases in the population, the cooperation rates decrease significantly, indicating that it is the strategic uncertainty among the human subjects that hinders cooperation.

Herein, we address a different question using evolutionary game theory as a tool. If the payoff matrices are drawn randomly from an arbitrary distribution, what are the probabilities of observing a certain number of (stable) equilibria? We extend the domain of previous results for the two-player framework, which corresponds to a single diploid locus in population genetics, by addressing the full complexity of multi-player games with multiple strategies. In closing, we discuss an application and illustrate how previous results on the number of equilibria, such as the famous Feldman–Karlin conjecture on the maximal number of isolated fixed points in a viability selection model, can be obtained as special cases of our results based on multi-player evolutionary games. We also show how the probability of realizing a certain number of equilibria changes as we increase the number of players and number of strategies. "

The results are compared to previous work that also used computational intelligence techniques in order to solve the same problem but could not find all equilibria in all tests. Game theory is a very important subject, modeling interactions between generic agents, and Nash equilibrium represents a powerful concept portraying situations in which joint strategies are optimal in the sense that no player can benefit from changing her/his strategy while the other players do not change their strategies as well.

In order to arrive at a socially acceptable compromise, the decision-makers should seek an optimal trade-off between conflicting objectives that reflect the priorities of the various stakeholders. In this study, game theory was applied to a multiobjective conflict problem for the Alto Rio Lerma Irrigation District, located in the state of Guanajuato in Mexico, where economic benefits from agricultural production should be balanced with associated negative environmental impacts. The short period of rainfall in this area, combined with high groundwater withdrawals from irrigation wells, has produced severe aquifer overdraft. In addition, current agricultural practices of applying high loads of fertilizers and pesticides have contaminated regions of the aquifer. The net economic benefit to this agricultural region in the short-term lies with increasing crop yields, which requires large pumping extractions for irrigation as well as high chemical loading. In the longer term, this can produce economic loss due to higher pumping costs (i.e., higher lift requirements), or even loss of the aquifer as a viable source of water. Negative environmental impacts include continued diminishment of groundwater quality, and declining groundwater levels in the basin, which can damage surface water systems that support environmental habitats. The two primary stakeholders or players, the farmers in the irrigation district and the community at large, must find an optimal balance between positive economic benefits and negative environmental impacts. In this paper, game theory was applied to find the optimal solution between the two conflicting objectives among 12 alternative groundwater extraction scenarios. Different attributes were used to quantify the benefits and costs of the two objectives, and, following generation of the Pareto frontier or trade-off curve, four conflict resolution methods were then applied.

Moreover, the analysis of the general problem also leads to a solution to a problem of “sampling without replacement”. Besides presenting a combinatorial solution to the general problem, and discussing its “expressive complexity” via its relationship with the well-known integer partition problem, we also provide a computer solution, implemented in Prolog, based on a non-trivial recurrence relation. Relying on the latter result, we then carry out preliminary analysis of the computational aspects of some of the rules governing the Cribbage game. "

In this paper, we develop a novel hybrid model in which a centralized government allocates defensive resources among multiple potential targets to minimize total expected loss, in the face of a terrorist being either strategic or non-strategic. The attack probabilities of a strategic terrorist are endogenously determined in the model, while the attack probabilities of a non-strategic terrorist are exogenously provided. We study the robustness of defensive resource allocations by comparing the government’s total expected losses when: (a) the government knows the probability that the terrorist is strategic; (b) the government falsely believes that the terrorist is fully strategic, when the terrorist could be non-strategic; and (c) the government falsely believes that the terrorist is fully non-strategic, when the terrorist could be strategic. Besides providing six theorems to highlight the general results, we find that game models are generally preferred to non-game model even when the probability of a non-strategic terrorist is significantly greater than 50%. We conclude that defensive resource allocations based on game-theoretic models would not incur too much additional expected loss and thus more preferred, as compared to non-game-theoretic models. "

We take the linear threshold model as the influence model. We show first the expressiveness of influence games showing that they capture the class of simple games. Then we characterize the computational complexity of various problems on influence games, including measures (length and width), values (Shapley–Shubik and Banzhaf) and properties (of teams and players). Finally, we analyze those problems for some particular extremal cases, with respect to the propagation of influence, showing tighter complexity characterizations. "

A category shelf-space allocation framework with trade allowance is presented and a multi-player Retailer Stackelberg game is introduced to model the interaction between retailer and manufacturers. With this framework, a retailer maximizes profit by taking the manufacturers' trade allowance response into account, which provides a realistic approach of simultaneously determining the shelf-space and trade promotion decisions under the consideration of interactions among products. A piecewise linearization method is employed to reformulate the Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem into a linear \{MIP\} problem for optimal solutions. Numerical examples demonstrate significant advantage of the proposed framework and quantitative analysis leads to a variety of managerial insights. "

At the same time modern football - is, above all, a struggle in which not only has to overcome the resistance of a strong opponent, but also their own shortcomings, limited physical and mental capabilities. In essence, it applies equally to the sport of high achievements and youthful sports reserves. Basic game skills of young footballers formed aged 15-16, i.e. mainly in this age there is a process of becoming a game of skills. And that is why in youth football exists an underrated problem of psycho-pedagogical monitoring of the current athlete. Psychological and pedagogical training of the current condition of young players is a complex of measures for dealing with the psychological capabilities of the young athlete. It has its forms and means, as well as methods and evaluation criteria, which are not always as obvious as in other areas of training. A Need to study this issue was expressed by us in an attempt to create a comprehensive system of psycho-pedagogical support, assessing the current status of young athletes in the long-term training. In practice of the national sport in the integrated control includes pedagogical, biomechanical, medicalbiological and psychological control.

Based on survey data (n = 560), the results show that \{SNG\} players seek entertainment, fantasy, the challenge of competition, and escapism when playing SNGs. The study finds that although social capital does not moderate the relationships between three motivations to play SNGs—entertainment, the challenge of competition, and escapism—and subjective well-being, it does moderate the relationship between the fantasy motivation and subjective well-being.

Therefore, research has yet to fully explore the factors underlying players’ perception of \{HCG\} enjoyment. In this paper, we study the influence of motivational needs satisfaction and perceived output quality on perceived \{HCG\} enjoyment using a survey (N = 205) of a location-based information sharing \{HCG\} called SPLASH, developed as part of our research. According to the results, perceived needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness influence perceived enjoyment of HCGs, suggesting that \{HCGs\} that fulfill these three needs are more likely to be enjoyable, thereby encouraging players to make useful computations. The results also show that participants who perceive higher levels output relevancy report a greater level of enjoyment, indicating that \{HCGs\} that assist players in generating relevant outputs are more likely to be perceived as enjoyable.

In strategic behavior modeling, the users of the network are assumed to be game players who seek to maximize their utility with taking into account the decisions that the other players might make. The essential difference between the aforementioned researches and this work is that it incorporates the non-strategic decisions in order to design the mechanism for the overlay network. In this solution concept, the decisions that a peer might make does not affect the actions of the other peers at all. The theory of consumer-firm developed in microeconomics is a model of the non-strategic behavior that we have adopted in our research. Based on it, we have presented distributed algorithms for peers’ “joining” and “leaving” operations. We have modeled the overlay network as a competitive economy in which the content provided by an origin server can be viewed as commodity and the origin server and the peers who multicast the content to their downside are considered as the firms. On the other hand, due to the dual role of the peers in the overlay network, they can be considered as the consumers as well. On joining to the overlay economy, each peer is provided with an income and tries to get hold of the service regardless to the behavior of the other peers. We have designed the scalable algorithms in such a way that the existence of equilibrium price (known as Walrasian equilibrium price) is guaranteed. "

Whenever a showdown occurs, an unfair coin with fixed bias q is tossed, 0 ≤ q ≤ 1 / 2 . With probability 1 − q , the higher hand value wins as usual, but, with the remaining probability q , the lower hand wins. Both models favor the first player for q = 0 and are fair for q = 1 / 2 . Our somewhat surprising result is that the first player’s expected payoff increases with q as long as q is not too large. That is, the first player can exploit the additional uncertainty introduced by the coin toss and extract even more value from his opponent. "

In particular, it shows these results to be a direct consequence of results for a version of a large game re-modeled for situations where different players may have different action sets. "

The analysis identifies elementary conditions on the payoff structure of the game implying that the evolution of cooperative behavior is promoted or inhibited when the group size experienced by a focal player is more or less variable.

This approach can be adopted by either an attacker or a defender. However, when there are more than one decision-maker that can influence the evolution of a spread, each has to take into account the effect of the decision of the other into account in coming up with its own best control. This entails a source of uncertainty that is different from those of stochastic nature, but rather, it is strategic uncertainty of the decisions of other player(s). In this chapter, we provide a framework based on differential games to enable analysis of such scenarios. "

In this paper we investigate how the heterogeneity of countries in regard to ecosystems and wealth influences the stability of international biodiversity conservation agreements both without and with transfers. We further examine the effect of different degrees of ecosystem substitutability. We model a coalition formation game with players that have a continuous conservation choice. The conservation benefit is dependent on wealth and ecosystem quality. Aggregation of global benefits respects differences in ecosystem substitutability. In case of transfers, a fund redistributes coalition benefits according to a sharing rule. The main finding is that in the absence of transfers, compared to the homogeneous situation, heterogeneity in ecosystems and wealth reduces the size of a stable coalition. The destabilising effect is stronger the higher the ecosystem substitutability. Optimal transfers facilitate a large stable coalition. "

In such a game each player puts a unit wealth in the pot and the pot is won with equal probability by one of the players. The game ends when there are no connected players such that both of them have non-zero wealth. In order to characterize the final state for dense graphs a compact formula is given for the expected number of the remaining players with non-zero wealth and the wealth distribution among these players. Theoretical predictions are given for the expected duration of the ruin game. The dynamics of the number of active players is also investigated. Validity of the theoretical predictions is investigated by Monte Carlo experiments. "

In this novel approach the behavior of an ergodic system (repeated stochastic Markov chain game) is represented by a Lyapunov-like function non-decreasing in time. Then, the representation of the Stackelberg security game is transformed in a potential game in terms of Lyapunov. We present a method for constructing a Lyapunov-like function: the function replaces the recursive mechanism with the elements of the ergodic system seeking to drive the underlying finite-state Stackelberg game to an equilibrium point along a least expected cost path. The proposed method analyzes both pure and mixed stationary strategies to find the strong Stackelberg equilibrium. Mixed strategies are found when the resources available for both the defender and the attacker are limited. Lyapunov games model how players are likely to behave in one-shot games and allow finishing during the game whether the applied best-reply strategy (pure or mixed) provides the convergence to a shortest-path equilibrium point (or not). We prove that Lyapunov games truly fit into the framework for deterministic and stochastic shortest-path security games. The convergence rate of the proposed method to a Stackelberg/Nash equilibrium is analyzed. Validity of the proposed method is successfully demonstrated both theoretically and by a simulated experiment. "

Linguistic knowledge is automatically extracted in the form of fuzzy if–then rules. Our knowledge extraction is mainly based on the on-line incremental learning of fuzzy rule-based systems. In this sense, our linguistic knowledge extraction is the learning of fuzzy rules. We first briefly describe a market selection game, which is formulated as a non-cooperative repeated game with many players and several alternative actions. We also describe some simple strategies for our market selection game. In our market selection game, the payoff of each player depends on the actions of all players. When a particular action is chosen by many players, those players receive low payoff. High payoff is obtained from actions chosen by only a small number of players. This means that minority players with respect to their actions receive high payoff. Next we show how our market selection game can be handled as a pattern classification problem where a single training pattern is successively generated from every round of our game. A fuzzy rule-based classification system is used as a decision-making system by each player for choosing an action in every round. An on-line incremental learning algorithm is proposed for adjusting the fuzzy rule-based classification system. Then we show how our market selection game can be handled as a function approximation problem. A fuzzy rule-based approximation system is used as a value function for approximating the expected payoff from each action. Finally simulation results show that comprehensible linguistic knowledge is extracted by the learning of fuzzy rule-based systems. "

We show that “strong” players, i.e., players whose strategic complexity is less stringently bounded, can orchestrate the online correlation of the actions of “weak” players, where this correlation is concealed from an opponent of “intermediate” strength. The feasibility of such “online concealed correlation” is reflected in the individually rational payoff of the opponent and in the equilibrium payoffs of the repeated game. This result enables the derivation of a folk theorem that characterizes the set of equilibrium payoffs in a class of repeated games with boundedly rational players and a mechanism designer who sends public signals. The result is illustrated in two models, bounded recall strategies and finite automata. "

Since agreement payoffs of responder and dummy are exogenously given, there is no tradeoff between allocator payoff and the payoffs of responder and dummy. Rather, the allocator chooses the size of the pie and thus—being the residual claimant—defines his own payoff. While in the dictator variant of the envy game, responder and dummy can only refuse their own shares, in the ultimatum variant, the responder can accept or reject the allocator’s choice with rejection leading to zero payoffs for all three players. Comparing symmetric and asymmetric agreement payoffs for responder and dummy shows that equality concerns are significantly context-dependent: allocators are willing to leave more money on the table when universal equality can be achieved than when only partial equality is at stake. Similarly, equality seeking of responders is most prominent when universal equality is possible. "

We set out a model in which players accomplish cooperation in an intuitively plausible fashion. Players process information via a mental system – a set of psychological states and a transition function between states depending on observations. Players restrict attention to a relatively small set of simple strategies, and consequently, might learn which perform well. "

At an abstract level, an agent-based model (ABM) is a representation of the many simple agents and interactions among them. The decision making of the agents is based on the rules given to them. In an ABM, the model output is the result of internal decision-making and may differ with alteration in the decision path. On the contrary, with the set of rules embedded in agents, their behavior is modeled to take a ‘certain action’ in a ‘certain situation’. It suggests that the internal decision making behavior of agents is truly responsible for the model output and thus it cannot be ignored while validating ABMs. This research article focuses on the validating agents’ behavior by evaluating decision-making processes of agents. For this purpose, we propose a validation framework based on a participatory simulation game. Using this framework we engage a human player (i.e. a domain stakeholder) to allow us to collect information about choices and validate the behavior of an individual agent. A proof-of-concept game is developed for a city logistics \{ABM\} to test the framework. "

These concepts are similar to authority distributions and command games in Hu and Shapley (2003a, 2003b). An mcs is invariant if it incorporates all indirect control relations. We axiomatically develop a class of power indices for invariant mcs. We impose four axioms with a plausible interpretation in this framework, which together characterize a broad class of power indices based on dividends resulting both from exercising and from undergoing control. Extra conditions can further refine this broad class. "

The standard solution concept for such games is Markov perfect equilibrium (MPE), but it is well known that \{MPE\} computation becomes intractable as the number of players increases. We instead consider the notion of stationary equilibrium (SE), where players optimize assuming the empirical distribution of others' states remains constant at its long run average. We make two main contributions. First, we provide a rigorous justification for using SE. In particular, we provide a parsimonious collection of exogenous conditions over model primitives that guarantee existence of SE, and ensure that an appropriate approximation property to \{MPE\} holds, in a general model with possibly unbounded state spaces. Second, we draw a significant connection between the validity of SE, and market structure: under the same conditions that imply \{SE\} exist and approximates \{MPE\} well, the market becomes fragmented in the limit of many firms. To illustrate this connection, we study in detail a series of dynamic oligopoly examples. These examples show that our conditions enforce a form of “decreasing returns to larger states;” this yields fragmented industries in the \{SE\} limit. By contrast, violation of these conditions suggests “increasing returns to larger states” and potential market concentration. In that sense, our work uses a fully dynamic framework to also contribute to a longstanding issue in industrial organization: understanding the determinants of market structure in different industries.

Assuming that the higher degree of realism of media violence would impact stronger on players in a pretest–posttest design, we analyzed the influence of violent video game exposure on implicit and explicit measures of aggressiveness. According to an explicit questionnaire on aggressiveness, participants reported having becoming more peaceful, whereas an Implicit Association Test on aggressiveness (Agg-IAT) indicated that the association between self and aggressive behavior became stronger after violence exposure, confirming the unique utility of Agg-IATs in media research. The 3D visualization mode, however, did not further strengthen this association, and a mediation model of increases in aggressiveness by participants’ flow experiences was not supported. When inspecting flow experiences, an interaction effect between gender and visualization mode was evident: Male participants were more likely to have flow experiences in the high-realism (3D) format, whereas female participants were more likely to experience flow in the standard (2D) mode. We discuss the findings in the context of automatic information processing in aggression, and we contend possible changes in automatic behavioral precursors due to media influence. "

We first develop the adverse-selection approach to reputations in the context of a long-lived player, who may be a “normal” type or one of a number of “commitment” types, and who faces a succession of short-lived players. We use entropy-based arguments both to establish a lower bound on the equilibrium payoff of the long-lived player (demonstrating ex ante reputation effects) and to show that this lower bound is asymptotically irrelevant under imperfect monitoring (demonstrating the impermanence of reputation effects). The chapter continues by examining the (necessarily weaker) reputation results that can be established for the case of two long-lived players, and by examining variations in the model under which reputation effects can persist indefinitely. The chapter closes with brief remarks on alternative approaches. "

They can then use these to discover a simpler game which still embodies both their optimal decision policies. However the impact of this result has been rather limited because many common Bayesian games do not exhibit sufficient symmetry to be fully and efficiently represented by an ID. The tree-based chain event graph (CEG) has been developed specifically for such asymmetric problems. By using these graphs rational players can make analogous deductions, assuming the topology of the \{CEG\} as common knowledge. In this paper we describe these powerful new techniques and illustrate them through an example modelling a game played between a government department and the provider of a website designed to radicalise vulnerable people.

Individuals are endowed with a set of strategies, and in every round of the game they use one strategy out of this set based on their memory and learning process. The payoff of a player using a given strategy depends on the public goods enhancement factor r and the collective action of all players. We investigate the distribution of used strategies as well as the distribution of information patterns. The outcome depends on the learning process, which can be dynamic or static. In the dynamic learning process, the players can switch their strategies along the whole game, and use the strategy providing the highest payoff at current time step. In the static learning process, there is a training period where the players randomly explore different strategies out of their strategy sets. In the rest of the game, players only use the strategy providing the highest payoff during the training period. In the dynamic learning process, we observe a transition from a non-cooperative regime to a regime where the level of cooperation reaches about 50 % . As in the standard PGG, in the static learning process there is a transition from the non-cooperative regime to a regime where the level of cooperation can be higher than 50% at r = N . In both learning processes the transition becomes smoother as the memory size of individuals increases, which means that the lack of information is a key ingredient causing the defection. "

In this communication, we overview findings from our research on team sports performance from this naturalistic perspective. Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) and Team Situation Awareness (TSA) are well-known models of expertise in complex and dynamic environments, and have been applied in team sport settings. The results showed that experts use intuitive decision-making by recognizing spatiotemporal configurations, and share these configurations of play when need to be coordinated. Considering the need for Coordinated and Intuitive Decision-Making in team performances, our research has implications for designing tactical skills training in team sports. Research on tactical skills training in team sports has increased in recent years. Early works mainly focused on investigating Teaching-Games-For-Understanding's (TGFU) effects on explicit learning. More recently, researchers argued that team games training could benefit from the use of Small-Sided-Conditioned-Games (SSCG) for practicing and implicit learning. Based on these insights, a significant proposition from our program of work is that a training task in team sports needs to represent the realistic constraints from a competitive situation (e.g., time pressure, uncertainty), and that technological artefacts should be provided to players by highlighting relevant and shared configurations of play. Thus tactical skills learning could benefit from both of implicit and explicit feedbacks in a small-sided positioned game. "

The Decision Theory literature has shown that this family of preferences provides a tractable and flexible tool in order to deal with this kind of uncertainty in general settings. In fact, variational preferences are equipped with an accurate and explicit parametrization of the decision maker's attitude towards ambiguity, which is indeed represented by a cost function of the probabilities (called index of ambiguity aversion). In the present work, we study the effect of variational preferences in strategic form games under ambiguity in which players' uncertainty is expressed entirely in the space of lotteries over consequences by belief correspondences of the strategy profile chosen by the agents. We focus on primary theoretical issues related to this model that constitute a required background for applications or numerical methods. First, we give a general equilibrium existence result that we apply to a particular model in which belief correspondences depend on the equilibria of specific subgames. Other numerical examples are presented to show the model applicability. Finally, we look at the consequences of parameter changes on equilibrium predictions and study the limit behavior of equilibria under perturbations on the index of ambiguity aversion and belief correspondences. All the results are sufficiently general to be a useful tool in any interdisciplinary problem in which strategic interaction is affected by ambiguity. "

The online game market is modeled as a nested network, with the segment of accessorized buyers embedded within that of game players. Both segments exhibit local network effects within the segments, and they impose crossed network effects on each other. We demonstrate that offering free games emerges as the revenue-maximizing strategy when the positive network effect of the game is high and the negative network effect of the accessory is low. We distinguish between two major types of accessories—namely, weaponries and decoratives—via their network effects. The weaponries impose a threat on the game players and subsequently confine the growth of the game; this negative effect is absent for the decoratives, which can thus be priced higher. We also generalize our findings related to online games to cope with other types of network-based free services, ranging from social networks to various kinds of information intermediaries. "

Here one is given an exchange network G connecting a set of players V in which edges correspond to potential contracts between their endpoints. In the standard model, a player may engage in at most one contract, and feasible outcomes therefore correspond to matchings in the underlying graph. Kleinberg and Tardos [STOC'08] recently proposed this model, and introduced the concepts of stability and balance for feasible outcomes. The authors characterized the class of instances that admit such solutions, and presented a polynomial-time algorithm to compute them. In this paper, we generalize the work of Kleinberg and Tardos by allowing agents to engage into more complex contracts that span more than two agents. We provide suitable generalizations of the above stability and balance notions, and show that many of the previously known results for the matching case extend to our new setting. In particular, we can show that a given instance admits a stable outcome only if it also admits a balanced one. Like Bateni et al. [ICALP'10] we exploit connections to cooperative games. We fully characterize the core of these games, and show that checking its non-emptiness is NP-complete. On the other hand, we provide efficient algorithms to compute core elements for several special cases of the problem, making use of compact linear programming formulations. "

In reality however, the participants would possess information related to their operations which are not common knowledge, where demands are function of the players’ decision variables and shortages will occur due to irregular production capacity and unanticipated demand. In this paper, we present several seller-buyer supply chain models with asymmetric information structure and the additional feature of shortage as a decision variable controlled by the seller. We also investigate two mechanism design contracts provided by the seller to the buyer as an incentive to improve the profit of both parties. "

Each node has a preference weight for each node, and its objective is to purchase outgoing links within its budget to minimize its sum of preference-weighted distances to the nodes. We show that determining if a \{BBC\} game has pure Nash equilibria is NP-hard. We study ( n , k ) -uniform \{BBC\} games, where all link costs, lengths, and preferences are equal and every budget equals k. We show that pure Nash equilibria exist for all ( n , k ) -uniform \{BBC\} games and all equilibria are essentially fair.

Besides managerial efforts, the cultural distance and convergence influence the design of long-term contracts in form of incentives for efforts of cultural cooperation.

The corresponding increase in expressiveness allows us to use backtracking games as model-checking games for inflationary fixed-point logics such as \{IFP\} or MIC. We identify a natural subclass of backtracking games, the simple games, and show that these are the “right” model-checking games for \{IFP\} by (a) giving a translation of formulae φ and structures A into simple games such that A ⊨ φ if, and only if, Player 0 wins the corresponding game and (b) showing that the winner of simple backtracking games can again be defined in IFP.

Constraint automata have been used as the basis for equivalence checking and model checking temporal logical properties. This paper presents a multi-player semantics for constraint automata which serves to reason about controllability, interaction and cooperation facilities of individual components or coalitions of components in a given network. We introduce a temporal logic framework, called alternating-time stream logic, that combines classical features of alternating-time logic ( \{ATL\} ) for concurrent games with special operators for specifying regular conditions on the data streams in the network and on the write and read operations at the I/O-ports of the components. Since constraint automata support any kind of synchronous and asynchronous peer-to-peer communication, the resulting game structure is non-standard and requires a series of nontrivial adaptations to the semantics and verification algorithms for classical alternating-time approaches.

In the case of stochastic reactive processes, the corresponding stochastic graph games have three players, two of them (System and Environment) behaving adversarially, and the third (Uncertainty) behaving probabilistically. We consider two problems for stochastic graph games: the qualitative problem asks for the set of states from which a player can win with probability 1 (almost-sure winning); and the quantitative problem asks for the maximal probability of winning (optimal winning) from each state. We consider ω-regular winning conditions formalized as Müller winning conditions. We present optimal memory bounds for pure (deterministic) almost-sure winning and optimal winning strategies in stochastic graph games with Müller winning conditions. We also study the complexity of stochastic Müller games and show that both the qualitative and quantitative analysis problems are PSPACE-complete. Our results are relevant in synthesis of stochastic reactive processes. "

Our research supports what has been called a “rich get richer” model of problematic Internet use. In this instance, less stressed individuals manage to play WoW so as to enhance their offline lives.

By varying the ‘reality map’, which relates the amount wagered to the probability of the outcome, it is possible to move continuously from a purely objective game in which probabilities have no dependence on wagers to a purely subjective game in which probabilities equal the amount wagered. We study self-reinforcing games, in which betting more on an outcome increases its odds, and self-defeating games, in which the opposite is true. This is investigated in and out of equilibrium, with and without rational players, and both numerically and analytically. We introduce a method of measuring the inefficiency of the game, similar to measuring the magnitude of the arbitrage opportunities in a financial market. We prove that the inefficiency converges to equilibrium as a power law with an extremely slow rate of convergence: the more subjective the game, the slower the convergence. "

The first player, called the observer, can mark a fixed amount of vertices at each turn. The second one controls a surfer that stands at vertices of the graph and can slide along edges. The surfer starts at some initially marked vertex of the graph, its objective is to reach an unmarked node before all nodes of the graph are marked. The surveillance number sn ( G ) of a graph G is the minimum amount of nodes that the observer has to mark at each turn ensuring it wins against any surfer in G. Fomin et al. also defined the connected surveillance game where the observer must ensure that marked nodes always induce a connected subgraph. They ask what is the cost of connectivity, i.e., is there a constant c &gt; 0 such that the ratio between the connected surveillance number csn ( G ) and sn ( G ) is at most c for any graph G. It is straightforward to show that csn ( G ) ≤ Δ sn ( G ) for any graph G with maximum degree Δ. Moreover, it has been shown that there are graphs G for which csn ( G ) = sn ( G ) + 1 . In this paper, we investigate the question of the cost of the connectivity. We first provide new non-trivial upper and lower bounds for the cost of connectivity in the surveillance game. More precisely, we present a family of graphs G such that csn ( G ) &gt; sn ( G ) + 1 . Moreover, we prove that csn ( G ) ≤ sn ( G ) n for any n-node graph G. While the gap between these bounds remains huge, it seems difficult to reduce it. We then define the online surveillance game where the observer has no a priori knowledge of the graph topology and discovers it little-by-little. This variant, which fits better the prefetching motivation, is a restriction of the connected variant. Unfortunately, we show that no algorithm for solving the online surveillance game has competitive ratio better than Ω ( Δ ) . That is, while interesting, this variant does not help to obtain better upper bounds for the connected variant. We finally answer an open question [4] by proving that deciding if the surveillance number of a digraph with maximum degree 6 is at most 2 is NP-hard. "

Time is relevant in that some moves are enabled or disabled by previous ones, while for the spatial aspect one can impose constraints on the positions which can be occupied by certain pictures. Interaction can then be seen as a sort of visual game, in which players have to synchronise their moves in order to make the interaction progress. However, due to this dual nature, traditional models of concurrent computation are not sufficient to give reason of specific types of non-determinism encountered in visual interaction processes. We propose a characterisation of visual interaction in terms of games, and show that the algebraic structure derived from the association of temporal and spatial structures is canonically associated with a system of logics, in which the limitations on the possible inferences imposed by this type of non-determinism can be adequately expressed. Moreover, the logics can be naturally extended by the introduction of operators which simultaneously model both temporal and modal qualifications of formulae. In particular, it becomes possible to give a formal account of the “surprises” experienced by users in visual interaction processes or, equivalently, by players of visual games. "

The second model has the same lag structure, but the information structure corresponds to a lagged form of imperfect public monitoring, and players are allowed to communicate via cheap-talk messages at the end of each period. In each case, we construct equilibria in “delayed-response strategies,” which ensure that players wait long enough to respond to signals that with high probability all relevant signals are received before players respond. To do so, we extend past work on private monitoring to obtain folk theorems despite the small residual amount of private information. "

We present both a characterization of this value by means of properties and combinatoric formulae for calculating it. In simple majority games, the greatest power accrues to ‘moderate’ players who are located neither at the extremes of the spectrum nor in its center. In supermajority games, power increasingly accrues towards the extremes, and in unanimity games all power is held by the players at the extreme of the spectrum. "

We retrieve the cooperative solution for this game and show the cases in which cooperation enables a partial reduction in the negative externality. We analyze when it is jointly profitable to abate emissions, when it is profitable to reduce net deforestation, and when it is optimal to do both (abate and reduce net deforestation). Assuming that the players adopt the Nash bargaining solution to share the total dividend of cooperation, we determine the total amount that the non-forest owners have to transfer to forest owners. Next, we define a time-consistent payment schedule that allocates over time the total transfer. "

We show by analysis that given this assumption, punishing free riders can significantly influence the evolution dynamics, and the results are driven by the specific components of the punishing rule. Intriguingly larger thresholds of the game provide a more favorable scenario for the coexistence of the cooperators and defectors under a broad value range of parameters. Furthermore, we provide a two-layer network framework for describing the individual interactions, by extending the threshold snowdrift games to the double-layers networks. Here, cooperators are best supported on complex networks by applying the threshold, moreover, the interlinks between the two layers are conducive to reinforce the network reciprocity. "

According to Goffman, game theory is flawed because it applies a single-level model to two-leveled situations, ignoring the fact that people form impressions and expectations during or before any strategic game. In this essay, we provide a set-up endowed with these two levels. Firstly, players endogenize a given setting and frame the interaction. This determines what kind of game they will play. Secondly, they select Nash equilibrium strategies. As we shall discuss, it is possible in this way to consider how frames operate and what role they have in determining Nash solutions of non-cooperative games. "

abstract = "Abstract An iterated version of ultimatum game, based on generalized probabilistic strategies, which are mathematically modeled by accepting proposal functions is presented. These strategies account for the behavior of the players by mixing levels of altruism and greed. We obtained analytically the moments of the payoff of the players under such a generalization. Our analysis is divided into two cases: (i) no memory players, where players do not remember previous decisions, and (ii) one-step memory players, where the offers depend on players’ last decision. We start considering the former case. We show that when the combination of the proposer’s altruism and responder’s greed levels balances the proposer’s greedy and responder’s altruism levels, the average and variance of the payoff of both players are the same. Our analysis is carried out considering that the acceptance of an offer depends on: (a) a fixed probability p or (b) the value offered. The combination of cases (i) and (a) shows that there exists a p value that maximizes the cumulative gain after n iterations. Moreover, we show n × p diagrams with ïso-average” and ïso-variance” of the cumulative payoff. Our analytical results are validated by Monte Carlo simulations. For the latter case, we show that when players have no memory (i), there are cutoff values, which the variance of the proposer’s cumulative payoff presents local maximum and minimum values, while for the responder, the same amount presents a global maximum. Case (b) combined with one-step memory players (ii), we verified, via \{MC\} simulations that, for the same number of iterations, the responder obtains different cumulative payoffs by setting different cutoff values. This result composes an interesting pattern of stripes in the cutoff per n diagrams. Simultaneously, looking at variance of this amount, for the responder player in a similar diagram, we observe regions of iso-variance in non trivial patterns which depend on initial value of the proposal. Our contributions detailed by analytical and \{MC\} simulations are useful to design new experiments in the ultimatum game in stochastic scenarios. "

In this paper, characters learn this representation by imitating human players. We here put forward a modified version of the growing neural gas model (GNG) called stable growing neural gas (SGNG). The algorithm is able to learn how to use the environment from one or more teachers (players) by representing it with a graph. Unlike GNG, \{SGNG\} learning is in-line, reflecting the dynamic nature of the environment. The evaluation of the quality of the learned representations are detailed. "

We examined variables derived from eco-dialogical coding of an episode of World of Warcraft play involving three English learners. According to the Eco-dialogical model (Zheng, 2012), second language (L2) learners need to learn to take skilled linguistic action (Cowley, 2013), a process of realizing the values of physical, sociocultural and dialogical affordances in the environment. We employed Multinomial Logistic Regression to determine which of our variables were predictors for three types of values realizing; namely, wayfinding orienting to sociocultural norms and synergized values realizing of both wayfinding and orientation to sociocultural norms. The model we developed suggested that when communicative projects collectively entailed players’ a) verbalizing with synchronized avatar action, b) attending to game rules and c) coordinating in anticipation of good future prospects, players were more likely to realize both values realizing types synergistically. In other words, players' skilled linguistic action of prospective coordination, combined with multimodal languaging and constrained by WoW game rules, together, were more likely to lead to dual values realizing. This finding suggests that dual values realizing evokes connections between real-time first-order physical movements and multimodal languaging with situation transcending practices (Linell, 2009) which are second-order rules, and other sociocultural and linguistic norms. Coupling this finding with our Eco-dialogical unit of analysis, communicative projects, we suggest that these language learners developed co-agency. We conclude that our model should be tested in future studies that seek to illuminate the contribution of a new Eco-dialogical understanding of \{L2\} learning and the potential for learners to have high quality languaging experiences in multiplayer 3D game environments and other social semiotically rich contexts.

Two players R (for rows) and C (for columns) alternately reduce a positive entry of A by 1 or pass. If they pass successively, the game is a draw. Otherwise, the game ends when a row or column contains only zeros, in which case R or C wins, respectively. If a zero row and column appear simultaneously, then the player who made the last move is the winner. We will also study another version of the game, called D-SEKI, in which the above case is defined as a draw. An integer non-negative matrix A is a seki or d-seki if the corresponding game results in a draw, regardless of whether R or C begins. Of particular interest are the matrices in which each player loses after every option except pass. Such a matrix is called a complete seki or a complete d-seki. For example, each matrix with entries in { 0 , 1 } that has the same sum (at least 2) in each row and column is a complete d-seki, and each such matrix with entries in { 0 , 1 , 2 } is a complete seki. The game \{SEKI\} is closely related to the seki (shared life) positions in the classical game of GO. "

We find that some data sets are best modeled with split distributions; that is, one portion of the data is well modeled with one particular distribution, and the rest of the data with another. We describe how our models can be simulated and discuss how host processing speed influences packet interarrival processes, which in turn influence playability. The latter is a clear indication that end user quality of service is more than just a network issue—host characteristics must be considered as well.

Methods Data were gathered from 22 professional male rugby union players using auto-confrontation interviews to help identify situations within games when players experienced intense emotions. We assessed the intensity of emotions experienced before each discrete performance and therefore could assess the emotion–performance relationship within a competition. Results Players identified experiencing intense emotions at 189 time-points. Experts in rugby union rated the quality of each performance at these 189 time-points on a visual analog scale. A Linear Mixed Effects model to investigate emotion–performance relationships found additive effects of game location, game time, and emotions on individual performance. Conclusion Results showed 7 different pre-performance emotions, with high anxiety and anger associating with poor performance. Future research should continue to investigate emotion–performance relationships during performance using video-assisted recall and use a measure of performance that has face validity for players and coaches alike.

Often, models in this subclass have the property of becoming trapped with probability 1 in some degenerate state. While previous work has concentrated on such limit results, we concentrate here on a contrary effect, namely that the time to become trapped may increase exponentially in 1/x as the discount rate, 1−x, approaches 1. As a result, the time to become trapped may easily exceed the lifetime of the simulation or of the physical data being modeled. In such a case, the quasi-stationary behavior is more germane. We apply our results to a model of social network formation based on ternary (three-person) interactions with uniform positive reinforcement. "

In this paper, we focus on solving games in recursive game graphs which can model the control flow in sequential programs with recursive procedure calls. While such games can be viewed as the pushdown games studied in the literature, the natural notion of winning in our framework requires the strategies to be modular with only local memory; that is, resolution of choices within a module does not depend on the context in which the module is invoked, but only on the history within the current invocation of the module. While reachability in (global) pushdown games is known to be EXPTIME-complete, we show reachability in modular games to be NP-complete. We present a fixed-point computation algorithm for solving modular games such that in the worst case the number of iterations is exponential in the total number of returned values from the modules. If the strategy within a module does not depend on the global history, but can remember the history of the past invocations of this module, that is, if memory is local but persistent, we show that reachability becomes undecidable.

Because of increased awareness that online-game addiction is a legitimate concern, understanding why and how people become addicted to online games is crucial. Our research model was empirically evaluated using survey data collected from online-game users. The partial least squares method of structural equation modeling was used to examine the research hypothesis. The findings reveal that mediated motives (entertainment, passing time, and escape) and interpersonal motives (social interaction and coplaying) significantly influence flow experiences, which in turn influence addiction. In addition, this study implies that interpersonal motives influence the flow of online-game players more than mediated motives do. Previous studies have mainly focused on the negative effects of addiction, whereas this paper proposes that online-game addiction is crucial for flow. The findings of this study elucidate some crucial determinants of player addiction that have not been addressed by previous research. The behavior of online-game players has become a critical concern for online-game designers and providers. Therefore, researchers increasingly believe that understanding online-game player behavior is crucial to the success of online-game providers. This study suggests that online-game designers and providers must determine strategies for building interactive experiences that engage players and enhance interpersonal interactivity. This is a pilot study to empirically examine the role of flow experiences as well as its antecedents in online games by conceptualizing computer-mediated communication motives. Exploring the antecedents and consequences of flow for online-game addiction is a new research area of online-game research. "

Using the generalized \{ZD\} strategy, a player could get a payoff that is χ ( χ &gt; 1 ) times that of his opponent’s, when the payoff is measured with respect to a referencing baseline parameterized by 0 ≤ σ ≤ 1 . Varying σ gives \{ZD\} strategies of tunable generosity from the extortionate-like \{ZD\} strategy for σ ≪ 1 to the compliance-like strategy at σ ≈ 1 . Expected payoffs when \{ZD\} strategy competes with each one of the classic strategies are presented. Strategy evolution based on adopting the strategy of a better performing neighbor is studied in a well-mixed population of finite size and a population on a square lattice. Depending on the parameters, extortion-like strategies may not be evolutionarily stable despite a positive surplus over cooperative strategies, while extortion-like strategies may dominate or coexist with other strategies that tend to defect despite a negative surplus. The dependence of the equilibrium fraction of \{ZD\} strategy players on the model parameters in a well-mixed population can be understood analytically by comparing the average payoffs to the competing strategies. On a square lattice, the success of the \{ZD\} strategy can be qualitatively understood by focusing on the relative alignments of the finite number of payoff values that the two competing strategies could attain when the spatial structure is imposed. \{ZD\} strategies with properly chosen generosity could be more successful in evolutionary competing systems.

Our main questions are: (i) under which conditions do the allocations converge to a core-element of the game, and (ii) when do the allocations converge to some specific allocation, the so-called nominal allocation? The main contribution of this paper is a design method for allocation rules that return solutions in the core or ε -core of the game under delayed information on the coalitions’ values, and therefore the resulting allocation rule is called robust.

It has been argued that cooperation can be established in repeated dyadic interactions if cooperators punish defectors by withholding future cooperation. In social interactions involving more than two individuals, however, withholding future cooperation may result in penalizing not only defectors but also other cooperators. Hence, in such social interactions, it is unclear whether cooperation is most likely to evolve when cooperators are intolerant of any defectors. Here we show, by analyzing a stochastic model of n -player Prisoner’s Dilemma, that the evolution of cooperation can be more likely when cooperators tolerate some defection than when they have no such generosity.

These are complex problems with a hierarchical structure, where one optimization task is nested within the other. Despite a number of studies on handling bilevel optimization problems, these problems still remain a challenging territory, and existing methodologies are able to handle only simple problems with few variables under assumptions of continuity and differentiability. In this paper, we consider a special case of a multi-period multi-leader–follower Stackelberg competition model with non-linear cost and demand functions and discrete production variables. The model has potential applications, for instance in aircraft manufacturing industry, which is an oligopoly where a few giant firms enjoy a tremendous commitment power over the other smaller players. We solve cases with different number of leaders and followers, and show how the entrance or exit of a player affects the profits of the other players. In the presence of various model complexities, we use a computationally intensive nested evolutionary strategy to find an optimal solution for the model. The strategy is evaluated on a test-suite of bilevel problems, and it has been shown that the method is successful in handling difficult bilevel problems. "

abstract = "An evolutionary game of individuals cooperating to obtain a collective benefit is here modelled as an n-player Prisoner's Dilemma game. With reference to biological situations, such as group foraging, we introduce a threshold condition in the number of cooperators required to obtain the collective benefit. In the simplest version, a three-player game, complex behaviour appears as the replicator dynamics exhibits a catastrophic event separating a parameter region allowing for coexistence of cooperators and defectors and a region of pure defection. Cooperation emerges through an \{ESS\} bifurcation, and cooperators only thrive beyond a critical point in cost-benefit space. Moreover, a repelling fixed point of the dynamics acts as a barrier to the introduction of cooperation in defecting populations. The results illustrate the qualitative difference between two-player games and multiple player games and thus the limitations to the generality of conclusions from two-player games. We present a procedure to find the evolutionarily stable strategies in any n-player game with cost and benefit depending on the number of cooperators. This was previously done by Motro [1991. Co-operation and defection: playing the field and the ESS. J. Theor. Biol. 151, 145–154] in the special cases of convex and concave benefit functions and constant cost. "

The imitation game originally proposed by Turing constitute a very effective method to prove the indistinguishability of an artificial agent. The behaviour of an agent is said to be indistinguishable from that of a human when observers (the so-called judges in the Turing test) cannot tell apart humans and non-human agents. Different environments, testing protocols, scopes and problem domains can be established to develop limited versions or variants of the original Turing test. In this paper we use a specific version of the Turing test, based on the international BotPrize competition, built in a First-Person Shooter video game, where both human players and non-player characters interact in complex virtual environments. Based on our past experience both in the BotPrize competition and other robotics and computer game \{AI\} applications we have developed three new more advanced controllers for believable agents: two based on a combination of the CERA–CRANIUM and \{SOAR\} cognitive architectures and other based on ADANN, a system for the automatic evolution and adaptation of artificial neural networks. These two new agents have been put to the test jointly with CCBot3, the winner of BotPrize 2010 competition (Arrabales et al., 2012), and have showed a significant improvement in the humanness ratio. Additionally, we have confronted all these bots to both First-person believability assessment (BotPrize original judging protocol) and Third-person believability assessment, demonstrating that the active involvement of the judge has a great impact in the recognition of human-like behaviour.

We propose an exploration of rationalizability in the context of games with a continuum of players. We deal with a special class of these games, in which payoff of each player depends only on his own strategy and on an aggregate value: the state of the game, which is obtained from the complete action profile. We define the sets of point-rationalizable states and rationalizable states. For the case of continuous payoffs and compact strategy sets, we characterize these sets and prove their convexity and compactness. We provide as well results on the equivalence of point- and standard-rationalizability. "

At the same time, the cooperative equilibrium in the Prisoner's Dilemma is never stochastically stable. "

To examine the cognitive impact of action video gaming, we tested basic functions of visual attention in 42 young male adults. Participants were divided into three groups depending on the amount of time spent playing action video games: non-players (&lt; 2 h/month, N = 12), casual players (4–8 h/month, N = 10), and experienced players (&gt; 15 h/month, N = 20). All participants were tested in three tasks which tap central functions of visual attention and short-term memory: a test based on the Theory of Visual Attention (TVA), an enumeration test and finally the Attentional Network Test (ANT). The results show that action video gaming does not seem to impact the capacity of visual short-term memory. However, playing action video games does seem to improve the encoding speed of visual information into visual short-term memory and the improvement does seem to depend on the time devoted to gaming. This suggests that intense action video gaming improves basic attentional functioning and that this improvement generalizes into other activities. The implications of these findings for cognitive rehabilitation training are discussed. "

The nonlinear threshold is considered as the link capacity constraint and we study the case in which channel powers are adjustable at optical switching nodes (e.g., optical cross-connects (OXCs)). An \{OSNR\} Nash game is formulated with coupled utilities and constraints, in which each player (channel) maximizes its own utility function related to minimizing its individual \{OSNR\} degradation. We exploit this \{OSNR\} Nash game in three types of network topologies: multi-link topology, quasi-ring topology and general topology. A hierarchical decomposition approach leads to a lower-level game for channels with no coupled constraints and a higher-level optimization problem for the network. Computation of equilibria based on this hierarchical algorithm is discussed and evaluated by simulation for each of the three network topologies. "

Over the years, practitioners and researchers in the human-computer interaction (HCI) community have placed a lot of effort in developing processes and methods for use in interdisciplinary fields. An effective user-centered gaming interface plays an important role in the gaming industry and provides valuable contribution in the \{HCI\} practice. This is because it supports the mental communication and emotional response of its audiences that is the gamers, thus improving the interaction modes between the user and product. Hence, designing games in a manner that provides the same user experience to all players, irrespective of player motivation, experience or skill is becoming the focus of modern game research. This paper will attempt to address and review the literature on affective design elements, principles and methodologies that are suitable for the video games industry. "

abstract = "Abstract Prefetching is a basic mechanism for faster data access and efficient computing. An important issue in prefetching is the trade-off between the amount of network's resources wasted by the prefetching and the gain of time. For instance, in the Web, browsers may download documents in advance while a Web surfer is surfing. Since the Web surfer follows the hyperlinks in an unpredictable way, the choice of the Web pages to be prefetched must be computed online. The question is then to determine the minimum amount of resources used by prefetching that ensures that all documents accessed by the Web surfer have previously been loaded in the cache. We model this problem as a two-player game similar to Cops and Robber Games in graphs. Let k ⩾ 1 be any integer. The first player, a fugitive, starts on a marked vertex of a (di)graph G. The second player, an observer, marks at most k vertices, then the fugitive moves along one edge/arc of G to a new vertex, then the observer marks at most k vertices, etc. The fugitive wins if it enters an unmarked vertex, and the observer wins otherwise. The surveillance number of a (di)graph is the minimum k such that the observer marking at most k vertices at each step can win against any strategy of the fugitive. We also consider the connected variant of this game, i.e., when a vertex can be marked only if it is adjacent to an already marked vertex. We study the computational complexity of the game. All our results hold for both variants, connected or unrestricted. We show that deciding whether the surveillance number of a chordal graph is at most 2 is NP-hard. We also prove that deciding if the surveillance number of a \{DAG\} is at most 4 is PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we show that the problem of computing the surveillance number is NP-hard in split graphs. On the other hand, we provide polynomial time algorithms computing surveillance numbers of trees and interval graphs. Moreover, in the case of trees, we establish a combinatorial characterization of the surveillance number. "

Violent video game play led to less aggression when participants used motion-capture controls. Study 2 eliminated potential confounds by using the only game on the Wii system that can be played identically with or without motion capture (Punch-Out!!). Again, participants who used motion-capture were less aggressive. Study 3 looked for effects of cooperative vs. competitive play during 2-player motion-capture gaming (Soul Calibur, Wii). Participants using motion-capture controls in competitive and cooperative scenarios did not differ from baseline. These results run counter to standard models relating violent video game play to aggressive behavior, highlighting the difficulty in anticipating the effects of newer, more immersive technology. "

A path model (N = 160) was examined to see the mediation effects of arousal and presence between realism cues and state aggression. In line with the general aggression model, results showed that realistic blood color and screams increased arousal, but no effect was found for first-person perspective. Presence significantly affected users’ state aggression. However, contrary to our expectation based on the excitation transfer theory, arousal did not show any significant effect on aggression. In addition, presence mediated the influence of realistic blood color on state aggression. In the effects of graphic realism of violence on user aggression, presence did a crucial role.

This research builds on earlier work which studied the competition in a small tolled network meant for private modes of transport which have a choice of route. The earlier work showed that while both cities have an incentive to charge alone, once they begin, they are likely to fall into the ‘Nash Trap’ of a prisoner's dilemma where the incentive to defect is higher than that to cooperate thus eventually leading to a ‘lose–lose’ situation. The current paper extends the idea of competition between cities by setting up a system dynamic model of two cities which includes modes such as car, bus, train and walking and cycling. This paper innovates by integrating the simulation of land use transport interactions with a class room style experimental game and analyses the gaming strategies from a continuous repeated prisoner's dilemma involving setting of tolls to maximise the welfare of residents. The aim is to test (a) whether the strategies adopted are as theory predicts and (b) whether the players recognise the benefits of lower tolls when given information about the regulated solution and collaborate or continue to play to win. The results show that players respond to the information and maintain a collaborative solution which may have significant implications for regulation and the development of cities within regional partnerships.

Such a monetary authority represents a monopoly private money supplier or situations where fiscal policy drives monetary policy and hence the name Leviathan. Under no commitment, I characterize an equilibrium with reputation concerns. The centralized market interaction is modeled as an infinitely repeated game between the Leviathan monetary authority (a large player) and the economic agents (small players), where the size of the players refers to the ability to influence aggregate outcomes. This large–small player dynamics pins down the equilibrium set of payoffs. Under the assumption that agents do not refuse to use money purely for coordination reasons, the one shot game has a unique Nash equilibrium with maximum inflation tax. The set of equilibria is considerably enlarged in the infinite repetition of the game and equilibria with a lower inflation tax can also be supported by providing appropriate incentives to the money supplier.

Method An Internet questionnaire was developed and included: (1) self-perceptions as a risky driver scales (Driver Thrill Seeking and Competitive Attitude Toward Driving); (2) attitudes regarding street racing; (3) street racing video game playing, and (4) self-reported risky driving (Risk-Taking Driving Scale). A sequential logistic regression was performed entering age and driving exposure as control variables in the first block, self-perceptions as a risky driver in the second block, attitudes in the third block and playing “drive’em up” and “circuit” racing games in the last block to examine their effects on self-reported risk-taking driving. Results A total of 503 survey respondents were included in the analyses and only 20% reported any risk-taking driving. Higher score on the Competitive Attitude Toward Driving Scale, more positive attitudes toward street racing, and more frequent reported playing of “drive’em up” video games were associated with higher odds on the self-reported Risk-Taking Driving Scale. However, the Driver Thrill Seeking Scale and “circuit” video game playing failed to predict self-reported risk-taking driving. Conclusions Self-perceptions as a risky driver, positive attitudes toward risky driving and “drive’em up” street-racing games, but not “circuit” racing games, are associated with increased risk-taking driving. These findings are congruent with experimental studies in which games that reward driving violations increased risk taking, suggesting that risk taking may be a function of type of street racing game played by affecting self-perceptions as a risky driver.

We also include the feature of information flow by allowing Constructor to change labels of adjacent nodes. As an objective for Constructor the network property to be connected is considered, either as a safety condition or as a reachability condition (in the latter case starting from a non-connected network). We show under which conditions the solvability of the corresponding games for Constructor is decidable, and in this case obtain upper and lower complexity bounds, as well as algorithms derived from winning strategies. Due to the asymmetry between the players, safety and reachability objectives are not dual to each other and are treated separately. "

We provide bounds in terms of the number of rounds, where a round consists of a sequence of movements, with each player appearing at least once in each round. We model the sequential interaction between players by a best-response walk in the state graph, where every transition in the walk corresponds to a best response of a player. Our goal is to bound the social value of the states at the end of such walks. In this paper, we focus on two classes of potential games: selfish routing games, and cut games (or party affiliation games (Fabrikant et al. 2004 [12])). Other than bounding the price of anarchy of selfish routing games (Roughgarden and Tardos, 2002 [25], Awerbuch et al. 2005 [2], Christodoulou and Koutsoupias, 2005 [9]), there are many interesting problems about game dynamics in these games. It is known that exponentially long best-response walks may exist to pure Nash equilibria (Fabrikant et al. 2004 [12]), and random best-response walks converge to solutions with good approximation guarantees after polynomially many best responses (Goemans et al. 2005 [17]). In this paper, we study the speed of convergence on deterministic best-response walks in these games and prove that starting from an arbitrary configuration, after one round of best responses of players, the resulting configuration is a Θ ( n ) -approximate solution. Furthermore, we show that starting from an empty configuration, the solution after any round of best responses is a constant-factor approximation. We also provide a lower bound for the multi-round case, where we show that for any constant number of rounds t , the approximation guarantee cannot be better than n ϵ ( t ) , for some ϵ ( t ) &gt; 0 . We also study cut games, that provide an illustrative example of potential games. The convergence of potential games to locally optimum solutions has been studied in the context of local search algorithms (Johnson et al. 1988 [19], Schaffer and Yannakakis, 1991 [28]). In these games, we consider two social functions: the cut (defined as the weight of the edges in the cut), and the total happiness (defined as the weight of the edges in the cut, minus the weight of the remaining edges). For the cut social function, we prove that the expected social value after one round of a random best-response walk is at least a constant factor approximation to the optimal social value. We also exhibit exponentially long best-response walks with poor social value. For the unweighted version of this cut game, we prove Ω ( n ) and O ( n ) lower and upper bounds on the number of rounds of best responses to converge to a constant-factor cut. In addition, we suggest a way to modify the game to enforce a fast convergence in any fair best-response walk. For the total happiness social function, we show that for unweighted graphs of sufficiently large girth, starting from a random configuration, greedy behavior of players in a random order converges to an approximate solution after one round.

It is investigated by means of public goods games, the generalization of the prisoner's dilemma to more than two players. In compulsory public goods games, defect is the dominant strategy, while voluntary participation overcomes the social dilemma by allowing a cyclic coexistence of cooperators, defectors, and non-participants. Experimental and theoretical research has shown how the combination of voluntary participation and altruistic punishment—punishing antisocial behaviors at a personal cost—provides a solution to the problem, as long as antisocial punishment—the punishing of cooperators—is not allowed. Altruistic punishment can invade at low participation and pave the way to the fixation of cooperation. Specifically, defectors are overpunished, in the sense that their payoff is reduced by a sanction proportional to the number of punishers in the game. Here we show that qualitatively equivalent results can be achieved with a milder punishing mechanism, where defectors only risk a fixed penalty per round—as in many real situations—and the cost of punishment is shared among the punishers. The payoffs for the four strategies—cooperate, defect, abstain, and cooperate-&amp;-punish—are derived and the corresponding replicator dynamics analyzed in full detail. "

We propose in this paper the original concepts of scenario-value, process-value and coalition formation value, which represent the average contribution of players in a scenario (a particular sequence of coalitions within a given coalition formation process), in a process (a sequence of partitions of the society), and in the whole (all processes being taken into account), respectively.

The application of computers to these tasks – called procedural content generation – has the potential to reduce the time, cost and labor required to produce games. A range of generative algorithms have so far been proposed for procedural content generation. However, automated game design requires not only the ability to generate content, but also the ability to judge and ensure the novelty, quality and cultural value of generated content. This includes factors such as the surprise-value of generated content as well as the usefulness of content in the context of a particular game design. Studies of human designers have identified that the ability to generate artefacts that are novel, surprising, useful and valuable are facets of the human cognitive capacity for creativity. This suggests that computational models of creativity may be an important consideration for developing tools that can aid in or automate design processes. However, such cognitive models have not yet been widely considered for use in procedural content generation for games. This paper presents a framework for procedural content generation systems that use computational models of creativity as a part of the generative process. We demonstrate an example of such a system for generating instances for massively multiplayer, online role-playing games. The system combines the generative shape grammar formalism with a computational model of interest based on the Wundt curve to select new designs that are similar-yet-different to existing human designs. The approach aims to capture the usefulness and value of an existing human design while introducing novel or surprising variations through the model of interest. The system incorporates a metric that permits generated designs to be evaluated in terms of both their similarity to human designs and their novelty in the context of existing designs. "

A fundamental issue of coalitional games is to single out the most desirable outcomes in terms of worth distributions, usually called solution concepts. Since decisions taken by realistic players cannot involve unbounded resources, recent computer science literature advocated the importance of assessing the complexity of computing with solution concepts. In this context, the paper provides a complete picture of the complexity issues arising with three prominent solution concepts for coalitional games with transferable utility, namely, the core, the kernel, and the bargaining set, whenever the game worth-function is represented in some reasonably compact form. The starting points of the investigation are the settings of graph games and of marginal contribution nets, where the worth of any coalition can be computed in polynomial time in the size of the game encoding and for which various open questions were stated in the literature. The paper answers these questions and, in addition, provides new insights on succinctly specified games, by characterizing the computational complexity of the core, the kernel, and the bargaining set in relevant generalizations and specializations of the two settings. Concerning the generalizations, the paper shows that dealing with arbitrary polynomial-time computable worth functions—no matter of the specific game encoding being considered—does not provide any additional source of complexity compared to graph games and marginal contribution nets. Instead, only for the core, a slight increase in complexity is exhibited for classes of games whose worth functions encode NP-hard optimization problems, as in the case of certain combinatorial games. As for specializations, the paper illustrates various tractability results on classes of bounded treewidth graph games and marginal contribution networks. "

A playerʼs goal formula may contain variables controlled by other agents, and in this case, it must reason strategically about how best to assign values to its variables. In the present paper, we consider the possibility of overlaying Boolean games with taxation schemes. A taxation scheme imposes a cost on every possible assignment an agent can make. By designing a taxation scheme appropriately, it is possible to perturb the preferences of agents so that they are rationally incentivised to choose some desirable equilibrium that might not otherwise be chosen, or incentivised to rule out some undesirable equilibria. After formally presenting the model, we explore some issues surrounding it (e.g., the complexity of finding a taxation scheme that implements some desirable outcome), and then discuss possible desirable properties of taxation schemes.

Moreover, this study investigates the moderating role of gender in attaining a better understanding of the relationship between behavioral intention and its antecedents. This study finds that self-efficacy, social influence, trust, and utilitarian and hedonic outcome expectations significantly influence players' intentions to play online games. This study also presents that gender moderates the relationship between personal cognitive factors (i.e. self-efficacy, utilitarian and hedonic outcome expectations, and trust) and behavioral intentions, and between environmental influence (i.e. social influence) and behavioral intentions. The findings herein are able to help online game marketers and developers to better develop online games in order to enhance gamers' intentions to play. "

abstract = "Abstract This paper studies a dynamic Markovian game of two infinitely-lived altruistic agents without commitment. Players can save, consume and give transfers to each other. We identify a continuum of equilibria in which imperfectly-altruistic agents act as if they were a perfectly-altruistic dynasty which is less patient than the two agents themselves. In such equilibria, the poor agent receives transfers until both effectively pool their wealth and tragedy-of-the-commons-type inefficiencies occur. We also provide a sharp characterization of strategic interactions in consumption and transfer behavior. This provides new insights relative to existing two-period models. It allows us to differentiate between the Samaritan's dilemma – e.g. a child runs down its assets inefficiently fast in anticipation of transfers – and what we refer to as the Prodigal-Son dilemma – e.g. parents do not leave an early bequest, anticipating a child's profligate behavior.

We consider the effect of uncertainty about the sustainable resource size on the outcome of this game. Assuming a general dynamic for resource deterioration, we study the effect of increased ambiguity (i.e., uncertain probabilities pertaining to the common resourceʼs sustainable size). We show that whereas increased risk may lead to more selfish behavior (i.e., to more consumption), increased ambiguity may have the opposite effect. "

abstract = "AbstractBackground The potential for emergence of antiviral drug resistance during influenza pandemics has raised great concern for public health. Widespread use of antiviral drugs is a significant factor in producing resistant strains. Recent studies show that some influenza viruses may gain antiviral drug resistance without a fitness penalty. This creates the possibility of strategic interaction between populations considering antiviral drug use strategies. Methods To explain why, we develop and analyze a classical 2-player game theoretical model where each player chooses from a range of possible rates of antiviral drug use, and payoffs are derived as a function of final size of epidemic with the regular and mutant strain. Final sizes are derived from a stochastic compartmental epidemic model that captures transmission within each population and between populations, and the stochastic emergence of antiviral drug resistance. High treatment levels not only increase the spread of the resistant strain in the subject population but also affect the other population by increasing the density of the resistant strain infectious individuals due to travel between populations. Results We found two Nash equilibria where both populations treat at a high rate, or both treat at a low rate. Hence the game theoretical analysis predicts that populations will not choose different treatment strategies than other populations, under these assumptions. The populations may choose to cooperate by maintaining a low treatment rate that does not increase the incidence of mutant strain infections or cause case importations to the other population. Alternatively, if one population is treating at a high rate, this will generate a large number of mutant infections that spread to the other population, in turn incentivizing that population to also treat at a high rate. The prediction of two separate Nash equilibria is robust to the mutation rate and the effectiveness of the drug in preventing transmission, but it is sensitive to the volume of travel between the two populations. Conclusions Model-based evaluations of antiviral influenza drug use during a pandemic usually consider populations in isolation from one another, but our results show that strategic interactions could strongly influence a population's choice of antiviral drug use policy. Furthermore, the high treatment rate Nash equilibrium has the potential to become socially suboptimal (i.e. non-Pareto optimal) under model assumptions that might apply under other conditions. Because of the need for players to coordinate their actions, we conclude that communication and coordination between jurisdictions during influenza pandemics is a priority, especially for influenza strains that do not evolve a fitness penalty under antiviral drug resistance.

During the elementary steps of evolution a randomly chosen player modifies her strategy in order to maximize stochastically her utility function composed from her own and the co-players' income with weight factors 1−Q and Q. These models are studied within a wide range of payoff parameters using Monte Carlo simulations for noisy strategy updates and by spatial stability analysis in the low noise limit. For fraternal players (Q=1/2) the system evolves into ordered arrangements of strategies in the low noise limit in a way providing optimum payoff for the whole society. Dominance of defectors, representing the “tragedy of the commons”, is found within the regions of prisoner's dilemma and stag hunt game for selfish players ( Q = 0 ) . Due to the symmetry in the effective utility function the system exhibits similar behavior even for Q=1 that can be interpreted as the “lovers' dilemma”. "

We analyze how the limiter affects the dynamics of output and the performance of players, and explore the number of the equilibrium points and the distribution of conditioned equilibrium points of the model. We then discuss the stable region of conditioned equilibrium. The theoretical results and numerical experiments show that adding appropriate limiter can make the system more robust, and even get rid of its chaos. The numerical results show that chaotic output dynamics can be beneficial to one firm but harmful to the other, and can also be harmful to both of them, and also show that adding appropriate limiter can improve the performance of the player.

In all experiments, some subjects learn from past lottery outcomes, though the importance of these stochastic payoffs relative to expected payoffs depends on the game. Stochastic payoffs are less important when posted probabilities are equal to expected payoffs and more important when subjects are informed how much they would have earned from foregone strategies. "

Such games are described by a set of players, a list of playersʼ weights, and a quota; a coalition of the players is said to be winning if the total weight of its members meets or exceeds the quota. The power of a player in a weighted voting game is traditionally identified with her Shapley–Shubik index or her Banzhaf index, two classic power measures that reflect the playerʼs marginal contribution under different coalition formation scenarios. In this paper, we investigate by how much one can change a playerʼs power, as measured by these indices, by modifying the quota. We give tight bounds on the changes in the individual playerʼs power that can result from a change in quota. We then describe an efficient algorithm for determining whether there is a value of the quota that makes a given player a dummy, i.e., reduces her power (as measured by both indices) to 0. We also study how the choice of quota can affect the relative power of the players. Finally, we investigate scenarios where oneʼs choice in setting the quota is constrained. We show that optimally choosing between two values of the quota is complete for the complexity class PP, which is believed to be significantly more powerful than NP. On the other hand, we empirically demonstrate that even small changes in quota can have a significant effect on a playerʼs power. "

In addition to the application of the usual strategies in the present model the players are also characterized by one of the two extreme personal features representing the egoist or fraternal behavior. During the evolution each player can modify both her own strategy and/or personal feature via a myopic update process in order to improve her utility. The results of numerical simulations and stability analysis are summarized in phase diagrams representing a wide scale of spatially ordered distribution of strategies and personal features when varying the payoff parameters. In most of the cases only two of the four possible options prevail and may form sublattice ordered spatial structure. The evolutionary advantage of the fraternal attitude is demonstrated within a large range of payoff parameters including the region of prisoner's dilemma where egoist defectors and fraternal cooperators form a role-separating chessboard like pattern.

Although this approach successfully explains human behavior in many situations, there is a wealth of experimental evidence demonstrating conditions where people deviate from the predictions of these models. One setting that has received particular attention is fixed length repeated games. Iterating a social dilemma can promote cooperation through direct reciprocity, even if it is common knowledge that all players are rational and self-interested. However, this is not the case if the length of the game is known to the players. In the final round, a rational player will defect, because there is no future to be concerned with. But if you know the other player will defect in the last round, then you should defect in the second to last round, and so on. This logic of backwards induction leads to immediate defection as the only rational (sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium) strategy. When people actually play such games, however, immediate defection is rare. Here we use evolutionary dynamics in finite populations to study the centipede game, which is designed to explore this issue of backwards induction. We make the following observation: since full cooperation can risk-dominate immediate defection in the centipede game, stochastic evolutionary dynamics can favor both delayed defection and even full cooperation. Furthermore, our evolutionary model can quantitatively reproduce human behavior from two experiments by fitting a single free parameter, which is the product of population size and selection intensity. Thus we provide evidence that people’s cooperative behavior in fixed length games, which is often called ‘irrational’, may in fact be the favored outcome of natural selection. "

Although the existence of a Nash equilibrium is guaranteed in the mixed framework (i.e., when players select their actions in a randomized manner) in many real-world applications the existence of “any” equilibrium is not enough. Rather, it is often desirable to single out equilibria satisfying some additional requirements (in order, for instance, to guarantee a minimum payoff to certain players), which we call constrained Nash equilibria. In this paper, a formal framework for specifying these kinds of requirement is introduced and investigated in the context of graphical games, where a player p may directly be interested in some of the other players only, called the neighbors of p . This setting is very useful for modeling large population games, where typically each player does not directly depend on all the players, and representing her utility function extensively is either inconvenient or infeasible. Based on this framework, the complexity of deciding the existence and of computing constrained equilibria is then investigated, in the light of evidencing how the intrinsic difficulty of these tasks is affected by the requirements prescribed at the equilibrium and by the structure of players’ interactions. The analysis is carried out for the setting of mixed strategies as well as for the setting of pure strategies, i.e., when players are forced to deterministically choose the action to perform. In particular, for this latter case, restrictions on players’ interactions and on constraints are identified, that make the computation of Nash equilibria an easy problem, for which polynomial and highly-parallelizable algorithms are presented.

And yet, by and large, decisions must be made under risk, uncertainty, and incomplete or fuzzy information based on adaptive perception knowledge (Figure 3), which may imply large amounts of linguistic and probabilistic information with missing data. In the case of two opponents, the synergy of fuzzy approach and matrix games seems rather effective for modelling such multi-criteria conflicting situations. This synergy is feasible provide the game equilibrium stability concept is conceived in compliance with an adequate uncertainty preference scheme of decision making. In the case of two scenarios or states of a conflict, the preference scheme for a given participating decision-maker has to include components for handling cases of one state strict preference over another state, equal preference between the states, and also uncertainty preference. The fuzzy modelling based procedure is employed to take into account some of the subjective attitudes of the decision makers that are difficult to model using classical game theory. "

Data on the spatial distribution of fish catches (1977–2011) are used to model changes in the distribution of the mackerel stock. The Nash equilibrium solutions predict a severe decimation of the stock through overfishing, either by parties (Iceland, the Faeroe Islands) that refuse to cooperate or by a general absence of cooperation. There is a wide discrepancy between this prediction and reality, as the stock seems, at most, only moderately overexploited, despite non-cooperation by Iceland and the Faeroe Islands. It is conjectured that these parties, and others, may engage in a degree of quasi-cooperation that falls somewhat short of full cooperation but avoids the extreme destruction of the Nash equilibrium. This tacit cooperation can be seen as being maintained by a mutually assured destruction of the fisheries of all parties in case they go to the logical extremes of non-cooperation. "

There are essentially five such ways to combine two proper games into a proper game. The most decisive is the lexicographic rule, where a coalition must either win in G 1 , or block in G 1 and win in G 2 . When two isomorphic games are combined lexicographically, a given role for a player confers equal or more power when held in the first game than the second, if power is assessed by any semi-value. A game is lexicographically separable when the players of the two components partition the whole set. Games with veto players are not separable, and games of two or more players with identical roles are separable only if decisive. Some separable games are egalitarian in that they give players identical roles. "

This is a puzzle because paying a cost to benefit another in one-shot interactions gives no direct or indirect benefits to the cooperator. This paper explores the logic of two competing evolutionary hypotheses to explain this behavior. The ``norm psychology'' hypothesis holds that a player's choice of strategy reflects socially-learned cultural norms. Its premise is that over the course of human evolutionary history, cultural norms varied considerably across human societies, and through a process of gene-culture co-evolution, humans evolved mechanisms to learn and adopt the norms that are successful in their particular society. The ``mismatch'' hypothesis holds that pro-social preferences evolved genetically in our hunter–gatherer past where one-shot anonymous interactions were rare and these preferences are misapplied in modern laboratory settings. I compare these hypotheses by adopting a well-known model of the mismatch hypothesis and show that selection for one-shot cooperation in the model is an artifact of agents being confined to only two strategies: Tit-for-Tat and Always Defect. Allowing for repentant and forgiving strategies reverses selection away from one-shot cooperation under all environmental parameters. Direct reciprocity does not necessarily lead to cooperation, but instead generates many different normative equilibria depending on a group's idiosyncratic evolutionary history. Therefore, an agent whose behavior is evoked solely from non-cultural environmental cues will be disadvantaged relative to an agent who learns the locally successful norms. Cooperation in one-shot laboratory experiments is thus more easily explained as the result of a psychology evolved for learning social norms than as a genetic mismatch. "

The recent developments in reliable network design require the link capacities to be treated as stochastic. It is, however, laborious to collect data to explicitly model stochastic nature of link capacities. It is also hard to relate the link-level randomness and system-level performance. A smarter alternative is to treat link capacities as random variables and search for probability distributions over such random variables which would effect in a worst case scenario. One can then assess the performance of the network at this worst case and comment on the reliability of the network. This paper formulates and solves a worst case stochastic link capacity degradation problem. The randomness involved has been modeled as the mixed strategy profile of a player in a fictitious game. The players of the game – a friend who plays for the network and a foe who plays against the network – compete each other to minimize and maximize the expected system travel time (ESTT). The foe has been modeled as an intelligent player, who knows that the network users would settle to probabilistic user equilibrium (PUE). The foe is also cautious of the friend's presence who would try to assign flows system-optimally, thereby minimizing the ESTT. The game has been formulated as a multi-level optimization equation. Different algorithms which can use the results from this methodology as inputs to establish most probable worst case states of the network have been discussed. A planner can input the results from this problem into some of the existing algorithms to identify the most probable worst case states, and the probabilities associated with these states, thus defining the reliability of the network.

In order to shorten the time required for detecting such an illegal activity or failures, in addition some interim inspections are performed in these facilities during the reference time interval. The optimal distribution of these interim inspections in space and time poses considerable analytical problems since adversary strategies have to be taken into account. So far only special cases have been analysed successfully, but these results lead to a conjecture for the solution of the general case which is surprisingly simple in view of the complexity of this inspection problem.

Based on a fairly general model, a condition for a precautionary policy is discussed. By applying the framework to a common-property resource problem with a linear production technology, we illustrate how the qualitative as well as quantitative nature of equilibrium is altered due to the possibility of regime shifts. In particular, when the risk is endogenously affected by the players׳ behavior, potential regime shifts can facilitate the precautionary management of resources as long as the resource stock is in good shape. As the stock of resource becomes scarce, however, the precautionary effect vanishes and more aggressive resource exploitation emerges. The impacts of irreversibility on the equilibrium behavior are highlighted. It is also shown that there can exist a resource-depletion trap in which a regime shift, once it happens, triggers a continuous decline of resource stock no matter which regime materializes in the subsequent periods.

Each plant is modeled by a discrete-time stochastic linear system, with the systems controlled over a shared communication network. We formulate the problem of security choices of the individual system operators (also called players) as a non-cooperative game. We consider a two-stage game, in which on the first stage the players decide whether to invest in security or not; and on the second stage, they apply control inputs to minimize the average operational costs. We characterize the equilibria of the game, which includes the determination of the individually optimal security levels. Next, we solve the problem of finding the socially optimal security levels. The presence of interdependent security causes a negative externality, and the individual players tend to under invest in security relative to the social optimum. This leads to a gap between the individual and the socially optimal security levels for a wide range of security costs. From our results, regulatory impositions to incentivize higher security investments are desirable. "

Often such mental models involve a hierarchy of reflexive reasoning commonly employed in social situations (“What do you think I think you think…”), and may be related to the developmental notion of ‘theory of mind’. In two experiments, the authors formally investigate such interpersonal recursive reasoning in college-age adults within the context of matrix games. Participants are asked to predict the moves of another player (experimenter's confederate) in a two-choice, sequential-move game that may terminate at various stages with different payoffs for each player. Participants are also asked to decide optimally on their own moves based on the prediction made. Errors concerning the prediction, or translation of those predictions into decisions about one's action, were recorded. Results demonstrate the existence of a “default” mental model about the other player in the game context that is dynamically modified as new evidence is accumulated. Predictions about this other player's behavior are, in general, used consistently in decision-making, though the opponent tends to be modeled, by default, to behave in a myopic fashion not anticipating the participant's own action.

Reachability problems play a paramount rôle in probabilistic model checking. Consequently, their analysis has been studied intensively, and approximation techniques are well understood. From a mathematical point of view, however, the question of approximation is secondary compared to the fundamental question whether or not optimal control exists. In this article, we demonstrate the existence of optimal schedulers for the time-abstract scheduler classes for CTMDPs. For CTGs, we distinguish two cases: the simple case where both players face the same restriction to use time-abstract strategies (symmetric CTGs) and the case where one player is a completely informed adversary (asymmetric CTGs). While for the former case optimal strategies exist, we prove that for asymmetric \{CTGs\} there is not necessarily a scheduler that attains the optimum. It turns out that for \{CTMDPs\} and symmetric \{CTGs\} optimal time-abstract schedulers have an amazingly simple structure: they converge to a memoryless scheduling policy after a finite number of steps. This allows us to compute time-abstract strategies with finite memory. "

When the communication is polylogarithmic in the number of strategies, we show how to obtain ϵ-approximate Nash equilibrium for ϵ ≈ 0.438 , and for well-supported approximate equilibria we obtain ϵ ≈ 0.732 . For one-way communication we show that ϵ = 1 2 is the best approximation quality achievable, while for well-supported equilibria, no value of ϵ &lt; 1 is achievable. When the players do not communicate at all, ϵ-Nash equilibria can be obtained for ϵ = 3 4 ; we also provide a corresponding lower bound of slightly more than 1 2 on the smallest constant ϵ achievable.

We further define a improving-replay Markov process to model the process of forming a reasonable payoff configuration. Accordingly, we give a simulation algorithm to obtain the desired payoff configuration to categorize players into groups by their satisfaction degrees. Finally, we give experimental results and performance studies to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of our methods. "

Although a number of computational questions surrounding crgs have been studied, there has to date been no attempt to develop solution concepts for crgs, or techniques for constructing solutions. In this paper, we rectify this omission. Following a review of the crg framework and a discussion of related work, we formalise notions of coalition structures and the core for crgs, and investigate the complexity of questions such as determining nonemptiness of the core. We show that, while such questions are in general computationally hard, it is possible to check the stability of a coalition structure in time exponential in the number of goals in the system, but polynomial in the number of agents and resources. As a consequence, checking stability is feasible for systems with small or bounded numbers of goals. We then consider constructive approaches to generating coalition structures. We present a negotiation protocol for crgs, give an associated negotiation strategy, and prove that this strategy forms a subgame perfect equilibrium. We then show that coalition structures produced by the protocol satisfy several desirable properties: Pareto optimality, dummy player, and pseudo-symmetry. "

Players who reach agreement are removed from the network without replacement. The global logic of efficient matchings and the local nature of bargaining, in combination with the irreversible exit of player pairs following agreements, create severe hurdles to the attainment of efficiency in equilibrium. For many networks all Markov perfect equilibria of the bargaining game are inefficient, even as players become patient. We investigate how incentives need to be structured in order to achieve efficiency via subgame perfect, but non-Markovian, equilibria. The analysis extends to an alternative model in which individual players are selected according to some probability distribution, and a chosen player can select a neighbor with whom to bargain. "

In the modern free games, publishers sell virtual goods in order to generate revenue. However, game publishers face dire negative attitudes toward the business model as it can entice publishers to degrade the enjoyment of the game in order to sell more virtual goods that address the artificial gaps in the game. This study focuses on this looming question in the game industry whether people buy virtual goods because they enjoy the game and want to keep on playing it or rather because their attitudes toward virtual goods are favorable and they believe it is also accepted in the peer-group. Player responses (N = 2791) were gathered from three different game types: social virtual world (Habbo) (n = 2156), first-person shooters (n = 398), and social networking games (Facebook games) (n = 237). The results support both main hypotheses (1) enjoyment of the game reduces the willingness to buy virtual goods while at the same time it increases the willingness to play more of the game. Continued use, however, does positively predict purchase intentions for virtual goods. (2) Attitude toward virtual goods and the beliefs about peers’ attitudes strongly increase the willingness to purchase virtual goods. Beyond these interesting results the paper points to several further lines of inquiry. "

Establishing a reasonable, general purpose access control game model of cost-benefit analysis is a non-trivial research issue. Considering the practical existence and involvement of user trust and permission risk, we construct a non-zero-sum game model for access control, choosing trust, and risk or cost as metrics in players’ payoff functions. We analyze the optimal strategies for the application system, the user, and also the Pareto efficient strategy from the viewpoint of both the application system and the user. A Nash equilibrium emerges that improves the rationality of access control decision-making under uncertain situations. In addition, we propose a proper risk estimation method. We also solve the risky permission set problem originated from access control constraints by utilizing optimal strategy in a finite multi-stage game. "

Our framework relies on easily verified assumptions on the primitives of the game, and relies on the theory of supermodular games. The underlying natural assumptions are satisfied in a number of two-stage models with an investment decision preceding product market competition. To illustrate the generality and wide scope for application of our approach, we present some existing models dealing with R&amp;D, capacity expansion and information provision, which motivated this study.

It has been shown (Li et al., 2013) that classic scale-free networks (Barabási and Albert, 1999, Barabási, 2009) are insecure against attacks of as small as O ( log n ) many nodes. This poses a natural and fundamental question: Can we introduce a second player Bob to prevent Alice from global cascading failure of the networks? We proposed a game in networks. We say that a network has an equilibrium game if the second player Bob has a strategy to balance the cascading influence of attacks by the adversary player Alice. It was shown that networks of the preferential attachment model (Barabási and Albert, 1999) fail to have equilibrium games, that random graphs of the Erdös–Rényi model (Erdös and Rényi, 1959, Erdös and Rényi, 1960) have, for which randomness is the mechanism, and that homophyly networks (Li et al., 2013) have equilibrium games, for which homophyly and preferential attachment are the underlying mechanisms. We found that some real networks have equilibrium games, but most real networks fail to have. We anticipate that our results lead to an interesting new direction of network theory, that is, equilibrium games in networks. "

Both stochastic processes are being “observed” by a third party point stochastic process, over which the information regarding the status of both players is obtained. We succeed in these goals by arriving at closed form joint functionals of the named elements and processes. Furthermore, we also look into the game more closely by introducing an intermediate threshold (see a layer), which a losing player is to cross prior to his ruin, in order to analyze the game more scrupulously and see what makes the player lose the game.

The Designer forms costly links among n given nodes and chooses to protect some of them at a cost. The Adversary then allocates resources to attack nodes. Successful attack on a node leads to its elimination. We study sub-game perfect equilibria of this game. Our main finding is that if defence is affordable and reliable, then the network is sparse and heterogeneous, and either centrally or fully protected. On the other hand, if defence is relatively costly compared to linking, then dense and homogeneous networks arise in equilibrium. "

Solution concepts that associate with each cooperative interval game sets of interval allocations with appealing properties provide a natural way to capture the uncertainty of coalition values into the players’ payoffs.

While we have the full implementation details of the module, we are only given a partial external specification for the interface. The interface specification being partial (incomplete) means that the interface displays only a strict subset of the behaviors allowed by the interface specification. Based on the assumption that interface specifications are typically incomplete, we address the question of whether we can tighten the interface specification into a strategy, consistent with the given partial specification, that will guarantee that all possible interactions resulting from possible behaviors of the module will satisfy the system specification Φ. We refer to such a tighter specification as Φ-guaranteeing specification. Rather than verifying whether the interface, which is often an off-the-shelf component, satisfies the tighter specification, the paper proposes a construction of a run-time monitor which continuously checks the existence of a Φ-guaranteeing interface. We view the module and the external interface as players in a 2-player game. The interface has a winning strategy if it can guarantee that no matter what the module does, the overall specification Φ is met. The problem of incomplete specifications is resolved by allowing the interface to follow any strategy consistent with the interface specification. Our approach essentially combines traditional run-time monitoring and static analysis. This allows going beyond the focus of traditional run-time monitoring tools – error detection in the execution trace, towards the focus of the static analysis – bug detection in the programs. "

This model is an extension of our previous investigation (Mazalov and Rettieva, 2010), where only two players exploit the fish stock. In this paper we construct the model with many asymmetric players in contrast to the traditional model of “fish wars”. We consider the coalition structure where players of each type can form a coalition, and show that it is more profitable for them than to join into one mixed coalition. The main goal of this work is to investigate the stability of coalition structure. We consider well-known concepts of external and internal stability and introduce another one – coalitional stability, which gives the possibility to form coalitions of larger sizes. We present the analytical analysis for non-cooperative, cooperative and partial cooperative players’ behavior and welfare. The stability conditions are also presented in analytical form, which can be helpful for practical ecologists in examining the harvesting processes in real populations. "

The analysis of Europe's best teams leads to the confirmation of the fact that the trends and current orientations of the handball game requires a more active and efficient presence of wing players in the modern game. This article aimes to create a statisctical model of the wing player from the statistical point of view, analyzing the values of parameters they obtained at the Senior European Championship, Serbia 2012.

We allow for two such models: a belief-based best-response model that uses a costly predictor, and a costless reinforcement-based one. This generates dynamics over the choice of learning models and the consequent choices of endogenous variables. We report conditions under which the long run outcomes are efficient (or inefficient) and they support the exclusive use of either of the models (or their co-existence). "

Building on alternating move games and models of rational inattention, the players' actions may be rigid, i.e., infrequent. This rigidity in the timing of moves makes the game more dynamic and asynchronous, acting as a commitment mechanism. Therefore, it can enhance cooperation and often eliminate inefficient equilibrium outcomes present in the static (normal form) game. Interestingly, (i) this can happen even in a finite game (possibly as short as two periods) and (ii) without reputation building. Furthermore, (iii) the required degree of commitment may be under some circumstances arbitrarily low and under others infinitely high. Our main example comes from macroeconomics in which various rigidities have played a central role. Investigating the Kydland–Prescott–Barro–Gordon monetary policy game, we derive the necessary and sufficient degree of long-term policy commitment to low inflation under which the influential time-inconsistency problem is eliminated.

The question of how strong the noise can be so that quantum players would still be better than classical ones is also dealt with. "

We develop a continuous time framework and obtain a stochastic differential game, where the government as well as the upper and lower social classes represent the players involved in the game. The stationary feedback Nash-equilibrium strategies are derived. Furthermore, we compare the results with another two cases where the government and the upper social class maximize their joint utility and the government transfers some resources to the lower social class. We find that under some specific conditions, the government which transfers some resources to the lower social class is more successful in creating a more harmonious society. "

They switch dynamically their behaviors and relationships based on other players’ behaviors or intentions. Interactions between players are highly complicated and hard to comprehend, but recent technological developments have enabled us to acquire positions or velocities of their behaviors. We focus on handball as an example of goal-type ball games and analyze causality between teammates’ behaviors from tracking data with Hidden Semi-Markov Model (HSMM) and delayed Transfer Entropy (dTE). Although ‘off-the-ball’ behaviors are a crucial component of cooperation, most research tends to focus on ‘on-the-ball’ behaviors, and relations of behaviors are only known as tacit knowledge of coaches or players. In contrast, our approach quantitatively reveals player's relationships of ‘off-the-ball’ behaviors. The extracted causal models are compared to the corresponding video scenes, and we claim that our approach extracts causal relationships between teammates’ behaviors or intentions and clarifies roles of the players in both attacking and defending phase.

The Monte Carlo simulation results demonstrate that the ruthless invasion of defectors can be efficiently prevented by the loners, especially when enhanced factor r is low. Further interesting is the fact that the introduction of a logit selection model, making the fittest neighbors more likely to act as sources of adopted strategies, effectively promotes the evolution of cooperation even if the loner is absence.

The real pulpwood price data was collected from two paper mills in the northern part of Iran. These mills buy most pulpwood in this area. Game theory has been used in order to investigate the market structure in this region. Game theory is the study of interacting decision makers. Game theory has been widely used in economics. Most economic behaviour can be viewed as a special case of game theory. A game model includes a set of players, a set of strategies and a set of payoffs. This study focuses on the theory of dynamic duopsony games. When pulpwood is sold, the different mills use mixed strategies to give sealed bids. In each transaction, each mill (player) has two different possible strategies (decisions): a high (H) or a low (L) prices. Which price should you set? What is the optimal price of the other player? Here the situation is a noncooperative game. Nash equilibrium and dynamic properties of the system are determined. Each mill continuously observes the frequencies of the other mills action. The expected marginal profits are calculated based on this information. In case the marginal profit of mill A is strictly positive (zero or strictly negative), mill A increases (leaves unchanged, decreases) bids. In case the marginal profit of mill B is strictly positive (zero or strictly negative), mill B increases (leaves unchanged, decreases) bids. It is found that the decision probability combination of the different mills follow a special form of attractor and that centers should be expected to appear in unconstrained games. "

Social capital at the individual level refers to the resources and support provided by bonding and bridging social networks; collective-level social capital refers to people’s civic engagement. A two-wave online survey was conducted to collect data from 232 Chinese \{MMORPG\} players. Two structural equation models were developed to test whether collective play influences offline social capital via the mediation of online social capital; the results did not demonstrate the existence of mediation effects. Specifically, collective play positively influences gamers’ online bonding social capital, online bridging social capital and online civic engagement. The effect of collective play on offline bonding and bridging social capital is not significant; the effect of online bonding/bridging social capital on offline bonding/bridging social capital is not significant either. The study finds a significantly positive impact of collective play on offline civic engagement. The effect of online civic engagement on offline civic engagement is not significant. In contrast with collective play, the time of gaming is found to negatively influence online and offline social capital. This study contributes to the knowledge of social capital because it tests the effects of new media on online and offline social capital in the Chinese culture.

Overall customer service-quality perception is operationalized as a multi-dimensional construct, consisting of service environment, empathy, reliability, assurance, responsiveness, game service, and food service. Path analyses show that casino service environment is the only factor that impacts player propensity-to-switch, whereas food service and empathy affect player retention. After separating the sample into three groups based on respondents' average betting, namely low-end, medium and high-end players, the influence of casino service factors on player propensity-to-switch and retention varies substantially among the groups. Results for testing the mediation model demonstrate that customer loyalty affects player retention and that casino service evaluations influence customer loyalty directly. A few measured factors such as age, education, occupation, and income influence player propensity-to-switch and retention. These findings have strategic implications for casino marketers. "

Individuals of human societies often appeal to some norm of fairness in situations where an agreement over the division of a surplus is required. The employed framework consists of players alternating offers that describe possible ways to share a certain commodity. The players are allowed a limited number of offers to reach an agreement; if they fail to agree, the player who made the first offer, the lucky player, wins the whole lot at stake. Uncertainty is introduced in the process by randomly choosing the lucky player at the beginning of each iteration. In the experiments, the players acquired strategies by employing a variant of Q-learning, a reinforcement learning algorithm. Experiments were performed with different configurations of utility functions on the players’ preferences in taking actions in risky situations. Analysis of the results shows that the game theoretical model of a single shot of the bargaining game used in the experiments closely matches the outcomes obtained in the simulated framework, despite the differences in the quality of the players, who are assumed to be fully rational in the theoretical model. Learning agents that are timid toward risky situations manage to acquire strategies that lead to fair outcomes when playing against each other, but find themselves in a disadvantageous position when confronting bolder types.

abstract = "Abstract We investigate an extension of the notion of backward induction to dynamic games with imperfect information and provide a doxastic characterization of it. Extensions of the idea of backward induction were proposed by Penta (2009) and later by Perea (2014), who also provided a doxastic characterization in terms of the notion of common belief of future rationality. The characterization we propose, although differently formulated, is conceptually the same as Perea's and so is the generalization of backward induction. The novelty of this contribution lies in the models that we use, which are dynamic, behavioral models where strategies play no role and the only beliefs that are specified are the actual beliefs of the players at the time of choice. Thus players' beliefs are modeled as temporal, rather than conditional, beliefs and rationality is defined in terms of actual choices, rather than hypothetical plans. "

To examine this, we offer a model of clock games, which we then test experimentally. Each player's clock starts upon receiving a signal about a payoff-relevant state variable. Since the timing of the signals is random, clocks are de-synchronized. A player must decide how long, if at all, to delay his move after receiving the signal. We show that (i) delay decreases as clocks become more synchronized, and (ii) when moves are observable, players “herd” immediately after any player makes a move. Our experimental results are broadly consistent with these two key predictions of the theory. "

Football players should decide the outcome of the game rather than the referees. Instead of technology discrediting the ability of referees it should be adopted into the game to increase the accuracy of the offside decision. A system has been proposed that uses player tracking technology to quantify players’ positions and runs an algorithm to determine which players are offside. The likelihood of algorithm error is dependent on the accuracy of player tracking technology. It was found that algorithm accuracy is improved by increasing the sampling rate and precision of player tracking technologies. The most suitable technology form for use in the proposed system is camera based player tracking. No device is required to be worn by players and body segment positions can be determined to ensure the offside law is completely adhered to. Before this proposed system could fully function a series of improvements must be made to the proof of concept model. "

Typically, these approaches employ a single evaluation function or criterion to induce three-way decisions. When extending the rough set based three-way decisions to multiple criteria decision making (MCDM), two issues are encountered. The first issue is related to the construction and definition of aggregation mechanisms for dealing with differences in results of evaluation functions. The second issue is related to the setting of choice structure for selecting the three types of decision choices. In this article, we consider the role and use of game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model to resolve and address these two issues. The issue related to differences in evaluation functions is addressed with \{GTRS\} by implementing a game that considers multiple evaluation functions as game players. The game-theoretic analysis in the \{GTRS\} is employed to resolve the differences by determining a tradeoff between evaluation functions. The issue related to choice structure is addressed by considering the conditions under which different game outcomes could constitute a game solution. In particular, the equilibrium analysis within games is used to construct the rules for three-way decisions. A demonstrative example is used to explain the use of the proposed approach. The relationship between the proposed approach and the probabilistic rough sets is also discussed. "

However, the traditional treatment of game theory fails to account for the apparent dynamics that characterises many complex games. New players and strategies might enter a game during game play while others disappear and utilisation functions change thus shifting the strategic focus of the players. Games that are characterised by a constant flux of their defining parameters – players, strategies and utilisation functions – will rarely settle into the kind of equilibria which are the focus of classical game theory. They behave more like non-equilibrium or dissipative systems as described in thermodynamics and chemistry. This article gives an account of how to model the complex dynamics of games that are characterised by a constant modification of their constituent parts. "

It captures a variety of situations in which players make partial commitments and allows us to characterize conditions under which equilibria result in socially desirable outcomes. However, since the game has many equilibrium outcomes, the theory lacks predictive power. To produce stronger predictions, one can restrict attention to the set of sequential equilibria, or Markov equilibria, or symmetric equilibria, or pure-strategy equilibria. This paper explores the relationship between equilibrium behavior in a class of monotone games, namely voluntary contribution games, and the behavior of human subjects in an experimental setting. Several key features of the symmetric Markov perfect equilibrium (SMPE) are consistent with the data. To judge how well the \{SMPE\} fits the data, we estimate a model of Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) [R. McKelvey, T. Palfrey, Quantal response equilibria for normal form games, Games Econ. Behav. 10 (1995) 6–38; R. McKelvey, T. Palfrey, Quantal response equilibria for extensive form games, Exp.

We suggest a game-dynamic model of the operation of several interacting gas pipeline projects treated as players in the game. The model treats the projects’ commercialization times as major players’ controls. Current quantities of gas supply are modeled as approximations to Nash equilibrium points in the instantaneous “gas supply games”, in which each player maximizes his current benefit due to the sales of gas. We find numerically Nash equilibrium commercialization policies for the entire group of the pipelines. We use the model to analyze the Caspian gas market, on which gas routes originating from Russia and Turkmenistan are competing. The simulations show the degrees, to which the planned regimes are not optimal compared to the Nash equilibrium ones. Another observation is that in equilibrium regimes the pipelines are not always being run at their full capacities, which implies that the proposed pipeline capacities might not be optimal. The simulation results turn out to be moderately sensitive to changes in the discount rate and highly sensitive to changes in the price elasticity of gas demand. "

In this paper we characterise core stability of chain-component additive games in terms of polynomially many linear inequalities and equalities that arise from the combinatorial structure of the game. Furthermore we show that core stability is equivalent to essentially extendible. We also obtain that largeness of the core as well as extendibility and exactness of the game are equivalent properties which are all sufficient for core stability. Moreover, we also characterise these properties in terms of linear inequalities. "

Resource management is one of the most important problems that faces Internet Service Providers. In the literature, the Autonomic Service Architecture is proposed to provide a resource management model that allows systems to manage themselves and aiming to utilize optimally the unused resources. Unfortunately, this model suffers from two major limitations. First, unused resources from underloaded \{VPNs\} (lenders) are utilized over the overloaded ones (borrowers) without considering the unexpected changes of the VPNs’ state, which may often happen in the case of multimedia transmissions. This may affect negatively the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of the lenders while improving the QoS of the borrowers. Second, underloaded VPNs’ operators might behave selfishly and refuse to lend their unused (spare) resources to other overloaded VPNs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a distributed autonomic resource management, which is modeled as a repeated non-cooperative game with stochastic and selfish players. The classical Tit-for-Tat strategy is modified to cope with \{VPN\} operators who are not always able to lend some resources to others. Four different strategies are derived from Tit-for-Tat to motivate \{VPN\} operators to lend their resources to others. As far as we know, our work is among the first efforts that uses repeated non-cooperative game theory to motivate selfish participants to cooperate and to distinguish between stochastic and purely selfish VPNs’ operators. In our setting, this results in cooperative sharing of unused resources among VPNs. Simulation results show that Tit-for-Tat strategy leads to deadlocks, while our strategies assure good gains to cooperative \{VPN\} operators and punish the selfish ones. "

Adopting the the prisoner’s dilemma game and the snowdrift game as metaphors, we find that cooperation can be maintained and even enhanced for low velocities and small payoff parameters, when compared with the case that all agents do not move. But such enhancement of cooperation is largely determined by the value of R , and for modest values of R , there is an optimal value of velocity to induce the maximum cooperation level. Besides, we find that intermediate values of R or initial population densities are most favorable for cooperation, when the velocity is fixed. Depending on the payoff parameters, the system can reach an absorbing state of cooperation when the snowdrift game is played. Our findings may help understanding the relations between individual mobility and cooperative behavior in social systems. "

Under this spatial restriction, a coalition can pillage less powerful coalitions without any cost. The feasibility of pillages between coalitions determines the dominance relation that defines stable states in which powers among the players are endogenously balanced. With the spatial restriction, the set of stable states changes. However, if the players have forecasting ability, then the set of stable states does not change with the spatial restriction.

All these games have been designed to always assure the convergence to a stable point in order to be implemented as distributed algorithms. To evaluate their quality, we also obtain the best achievable performance in the system using mathematical optimization. The system is modeled with the physical interference model and two different definitions of the network utility are considered: the number of active flows and the aggregated capacity in bps. Results show that the proposed games approach the centralized solution, and specially, that the simpler cooperative link game provides a performance close to that of the flow games. "

abstract = "This paper presents a simple repeated-game model of interaction between an optimizing government and the private sector. Two polar cases are considered: (a) the private sector is represented by a single agent; and (b) there is a continuum of heterogenous atomistic private agents. In both cases, the government starts each repetition by making a non-binding announcement about its future actions. The players have complete and perfect information, with one exception: the private agents do not know whether or not the government will act as announced. Thus, each private agent i either behaves with probability πi as if it trusted the announcement, or plays with probability 1−πi as a Stackelberg leader. After observing the reaction of the private sector, the government implements the actual policy measures. Finally, the private agent(s) update πi as a function of the payoffs received. We show that, although the government's announcements are never respected, acting as if they were true leads to an outcome that simultaneously improves the situation of the government and of those players that trust it, compared to the standard equilibrium solutions. An overwhelming majority of private agents very rapidly learns to behave as if the announcements were true. The other agents also experience higher payoffs due to an herding effect. The fact that the announcements are always reneged is crucial for the solution to be pareto-improving. These results are in stark contrast to the conclusions usually presented in the related economic literature. "

In our games, all payment pairs consistent with mutual cooperation in subgame-perfect equilibrium transform these games into coordination games, with both mutual cooperation and mutual defection as Nash equilibria in the second stage. When endogenous transfer payments are not permitted, cooperation is much less likely. Mutual cooperation is most likely when the (sufficient) payments are identical, and it is also substantially more likely with payment pairs that bring the mutual-cooperation payoffs closer together. Both the Fehr–Schmidt and Charness–Rabin models predict that transfers that make final payoffs closer are preferred; however, they do not explain why equal transfers are particularly effective.

A synchronous dynamics means that, at each time step, all the agents of the population update their strategies simultaneously. An extreme case of asynchronism is sequential dynamics, in which only one agent is updated each time. We first show that these two opposite update dynamics can lead to very different outcomes and that sequential dynamics is detrimental to the emergence of cooperation only when the probability of imitating the most successful neighbors is high. In this sense, we can say that, when the update dynamics has some influence, in general asynchronism is beneficial to the emergence of cooperation. We then explore the consequences of using intermediate levels of asynchronism, where only a fraction of the agents update their behavior each time. In general, the level of cooperation changes smoothly and monotonically as we gradually go from synchronous to sequential dynamics. However, there are some exceptions that should be taken into account. In addition, the results show that the possibility of agents taking irrational decisions has a key role in the sensitivity of these models to changes in the update dynamics. Explanations for the observed behaviors are advanced. "

We introduce a matrix game under time constraints, where each pairwise interaction has two consequences: both players receive a payoff and they cannot play the next game for a specified time duration. Thus our model is defined by two matrices: a payoff matrix and an average time duration matrix. Maynard Smith's concept of evolutionary stability is extended to this class of games. We illustrate the effect of time constraints by the well-known prisoner's dilemma game, where additional time constraints can ensure the existence of unique evolutionary stable strategies (ESS), both pure and mixed, or the coexistence of two pure ESS. Our general results may be useful in several fields of biology where evolutionary game theory is applied, principally in ecological games, where time constraints play an inevitable role. "

We introduce a non-model based approach for locally stable convergence to a steady-state Nash equilibrium. In classical game theory algorithms, each player employs the knowledge of the functional form of its payoff and of the other players’ actions, whereas in the proposed algorithm, the players need to measure only their own payoff values. This strategy is based on the so-called “extremum seeking” approach, which has previously been developed for standard optimization problems and employs sinusoidal perturbations to estimate the gradient. Since non-quadratic payoffs create the possibility of multiple, isolated Nash equilibria, our convergence results are local. Specifically, the attainment of any particular Nash equilibrium is assured only for initial conditions in a set around that specific stable Nash equilibrium. Moreover, for non-quadratic payoffs, the convergence to a Nash equilibrium is biased in proportion to the perturbation amplitudes and the payoff functions’ third derivatives. We quantify the size of these residual biases. "

Therefore, the stock in one region depends not only on the previous stock and catch in the region, but also on the stock and catch in neighboring regions. We derive the Nash and cooperative equilibria for an infinite planning horizon. We consider two ways to maintain the cooperation: incentive equilibrium and time-consistent imputation distribution procedure. We investigate the cooperative incentive equilibrium in the case when the center punishes players for a deviation. Also we consider the case when the center is a player and find the Shapley value and time-consistent imputation distribution procedure.

One of the model’s distinctive features is that it accounts for the two meanings of price, i.e., its classical objective measure of the cost of acquiring a particular quantity of the product, and its subjective roles as an assessment of the quality of the product and an evaluation of gains or losses (deal vs. sacrifice) resulting from buying a “cheap” or an “expensive” product. This dual computation is done with respect to the internal reference price. Our objective is to investigate the impact of retailer’s myopia on the pricing strategies and payoffs of channel members in this context. A myopic retailer is an agent that disregards the effects of its pricing strategy on the evolution of the perceived brand quality and the reference price. "

Further, although sensitivity analysis is of common use in any optimization setting, the impact of some parameters on strategic investments is not yet fully assessed in the context of the deregulated electricity industry. Starting with a benchmark model of the Finnish industry, we precisely explore the impact on equilibrium investments of varying such parameters as direct- and cross-price elasticities, length of the planning horizon and the depreciation rate of capacity. We run the model with different parameter values and compare the predicted equilibrium with what companies have actually done. The model is a stochastic dynamic game involving three players and played over a ten-year period. Our results show the depreciation rate and the planning horizon have a notable effect on investment levels, whereas price elasticities seem to play a lesser role. Although the model’s results are rather well aligned to total industry investments, it diverges from individual levels. This may be due to the cost parameter used and/or to the open-loop information structure adopted in the computations. In any event, these results should be of methodological and practical interest to scholars and practitioners involved in strategic investment in the electricity industry. "

Distributed subchannel allocation is studied using noncooperative game theory. A sequential game model is formulated where in first stage source nodes opportunistically select their transmission resources after which in second stage a channel-aware relay node assigns the resources in a way that maximizes the sum of utilities at the destination node. The subchannel allocation game is a potential game, possessing an implicit joint objective (potential) of the players. Numerical examples illustrate the performance of opportunistic channel allocation in an \{OFDMA\} system. Using the sequential scheme, noncooperative allocation in first link implies performance similar to that obtained by solving two consecutive assignment problems, first optimizing the allocation of subchannels in source-relay link and second in relay-destination link. Auction-based solutions to noncooperative subchannel allocation, both with fixed and variable transmit power, are presented to obtain approximate solutions to the underlying centralized resource optimization problems.

We show how the payoff structure in this scenario and other closely related ones correspond to the ultimatum and demand games of economics. In the model, there are both costs and benefits to a guild whose players have control over interactions. Control over interactions in the sense of being able to exercise partner choice can benefit a guild by selecting for mutualism in its partners, but is most effective in selecting against moderately exploitative partners, and so can give highly exploitative partners an advantage. This can generate dynamics similar to taxon cycles or those seen in models with competition-colonization tradeoffs, wherein increasingly more mutualistic partners (acting as superior competitors) are selected for up to a tipping point, at which highly exploitative strategies (akin to superior colonizers) gain an advantage. Control over interactions in the sense of being able to appropriate ‘surplus’ payoffs in each interaction, which is selected for within-guild and is equivalent to playing the role of responders, selects against high demands (and so for mutualism) in the guild with control. Combining the two mechanisms, a high degree of mutualism in both guilds and coexistence of more mutualistic and more exploitative strategies within each are both consistent with control over the interaction being highly skewed toward one side that does what is in its own short-term interests.

This paper proposes a new agent model which applies the agent-oriented paradigm to represent multiple objects. This agent model consists of three types of agents as follows: (1) an upper-agent which describes an autonomous and dynamic object; (2) a lower-agent which describes a reactive and static object; and (3) an environmental-agent which describes the environment of the other agents. As an example, we model soccer players (a kind of multiple objects) in EAMMO. Three kinds of soccer agents are constructed with different powers. We simulate the soccer games to confirm the effectiveness of our model. "

The model stresses the importance of providing the player with immediate feedback, clear goals and challenges that are matched to his/her skill level. The flow theory is used as a framework to facilitate positive user experience in order to maximize the impact of educational games. Especially, the factors that contribute to flow experience are discussed. The experiential gaming model can be used to design and analyse educational computer games. However, the model works only as a link between educational theory and game design and does not provide the means to a whole game design project. "

Effectively, rules are “players” who can strategically delegate future policy-making authority to different rules. A political rule is stable if it selects itself. A reform occurs when an alternative rule is selected. The stability of a political rule is shown to depend on whether its choices are dynamically consistent. For instance, simple majority rules can be shown to be dynamically consistent in many common environments where wealth-weighted voting rules are not. The result extends to political rules that incorporate private activities such as extra-legal protests, threats, or private investment. The approach is one way of understanding various explanations of institutional change proposed in the literature. A parametric model of public goods provision gives an illustration. "

Our game is a simple generalization of the standard game for negation-less logic programs introduced by van Emden [M.H. van Emden, Quantitative deduction and its fixpoint theory, Journal of Logic Programming 3 (1) (1986) 37–53] in which two players, the Believer and the Doubter, compete by trying to prove (respectively disprove) a query. The standard game is equivalent to the minimum Herbrand model semantics of logic programming in the sense that a query succeeds in the minimum model semantics iff the Believer has a winning strategy for the game which begins with the Doubter doubting this query. The game for programs with negation that we propose follows the same rules as the standard one, except that the players swap roles every time the play “passes through” negation. We start our investigation by establishing the determinacy of the new game by using some classical tools from the theory of infinite-games. Our determinacy result immediately provides a novel and purely game-theoretic characterization of the semantics of negation in logic programming. We proceed to establish the connections of the game semantics to the existing semantic approaches for logic programming with negation. For this purpose, we first define a refined version of the game that uses degrees of winning and losing for the two players. We then demonstrate that this refined game corresponds exactly to the infinite-valued minimum model semantics of negation [P. Rondogiannis,W.W. Wadge, Minimum model semantics for logic programs with negation-as-failure, \{ACM\} Transactions on Computational Logic 6 (2) (2005) 441–467]. This immediately implies that the unrefined game is equivalent to the well-founded semantics (since the infinite-valued semantics is a refinement of the well-founded semantics). "

In our model, the appropriation of the \{CPR\} by the incumbent reduces both players' future profits from exploiting the resource. In the case of complete information, we show that the incumbent operating in a high-stock common pool overexploits the \{CPR\} during the first period since it does not internalize the negative external effect that its first-period exploitation imposes on the entrant's future profits. This inefficiency, however, is absent when the commons totally regenerate across periods. Under incomplete information, we identify an additional form of inefficiency. In particular, the incumbent operating in a low-stock \{CPR\} underexploits the resource in order to signal the low available stock to potential entrants, deterring entry. "

This class corresponds to 1 1 2 -player games over graphs generated by \{BPA\} systems or (equivalently) 1-exit recursive state machines. An extended reachability objective is specified by two sets S and T of safe and terminal stack configurations, where the membership to S and T depends just on the top-of-the-stack symbol. The question is whether there is a suitable strategy such that the probability of hitting a terminal configuration by a path leading only through safe configurations is equal to (or different from) a given x ∈ { 0 , 1 } . We show that the qualitative extended reachability problem is decidable in polynomial time, and that the set of all configurations for which there is a winning strategy is effectively regular. More precisely, this set can be represented by a deterministic finite-state automaton with a fixed number of control states. This result is a generalization of a recent theorem by Etessami and Yannakakis which says that the qualitative termination for 1-exit \{RMDPs\} (which exactly correspond to our 1 1 2 -player \{BPA\} games) is decidable in polynomial time. Interestingly, the properties of winning strategies for the extended reachability objectives are quite different from the ones for termination, and new observations are needed to obtain the result. As an application, we derive the EXPTIME-completeness of the model-checking problem for 1 1 2 -player \{BPA\} games and qualitative \{PCTL\} formulae. "

Of all the genres of online games, \{MMORPGs\} (Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games) have become the most popular among network gamers, and now attract millions of users who play in an evolving virtual world simultaneously over the Internet. To gain a better understanding of game traffic and contribute to the economic well-being of the Internet, we analyze a 1356-million-packet trace from a sizeable \{MMORPG\} called ShenZhou Online. This work is, as far as we know, the first formal analysis of \{MMORPG\} server traces. We find that \{MMORPG\} and \{FPS\} (First-Person Shooting) games are similar in that they both generate small packets and require low bandwidths. In practice, the bandwidth requirement of \{MMORPGs\} is the lower of the two due to less real-time game playing. More distinctive features are the strong periodicity, temporal locality, irregularity, and self-similarity observed in \{MMORPG\} traffic. The periodicity is due to a common practice in game implementation, where game state updates are accumulated within a fixed time window before transmission. The temporal locality in game traffic is largely due to the game’s nature, whereby one action leads to another. The irregularity, which is unique to \{MMORPG\} traffic, is due to the diversity of the game’s design so that the behavior of users can vary drastically, depending on the quest at hand. The self-similarity of the aggregate traffic is due to the heavy-tailed active/idle activities of individual players. Moreover, we show that the arrival of game sessions within 1 h can be modelled by a Poisson model, while the duration of game sessions is heavy-tailed. "

In this paper, we introduce a social network based model to investigate the evolution of cooperation in the N -player Prisoner’s Dilemma game. As such, this work complements previous studies focused on multi-player social dilemma games and endogenous networks. Agents in our model, employ different game-playing strategies reflecting varying cognitive capacities. When an agent plays cooperatively, a social link is formed with each of the other N − 1 group members. Subsequent cooperative actions reinforce this link. However, when an agent defects, the links in the social network are broken. Computational simulations across a range of parameter settings are used to examine different scenarios: varying population and group sizes; the group formation process (or partner selection); and agent decision-making strategies under varying dilemma constraints (cost-to-benefit ratios), including a “discriminator” strategy where the action is based on a function of the weighted links within an agent’s social network. The simulation results show that the proposed social network model is able to evolve and maintain cooperation. As expected, as the value of N increases the equilibrium proportion of cooperators in the population decreases. In addition, this outcome is dependent on the dilemma constraint (cost-to-benefit ratio). However, in some circumstances the dynamic social network plays an increasingly important role in promoting and sustaining cooperation, especially when the agents adopt the discriminator strategy. The adjustment of social links results in the formation of communities of “like-minded” agents. Subsequently, this local optimal behaviour promotes the evolution of cooperative behaviour at the system level. "

Each aspect attempts to improve the under-approximation of winning regions or decrease the rank function by simplifying the structure of the parity game. Our design pattern is incremental as aspects may operate on the residual game of yet undecided nodes. We present several aspects and one higher-order transformation of our algorithms — based on efficient, static analyses — and illustrate the benefit of their interaction as well as their relative precision within pattern instantiations. Instantiations of our design pattern can be applied for local model checking and as preprocessors for algorithms whose worst-case running time is exponential.

Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of endowments around the mean. We argue that skewness reflects the social distance between ‘elite’ players with high initial endowments and other players with lower endowments, better than variance and concentration measures like the Gini-coefficient. We hypothesize that elite players become more selfish with increasing skewness and therefore contribute less to a public good in the framework of a one-shot non-linear public good game. The results of an experimental test, in which we systematically vary the distribution of endowments between treatments, confirm that the model is able to correctly explain the observed pattern of contribution behavior. We find that cooperation and efficiency are lowest with right-skewed distribution of endowments. Our paper therefore improves the understanding of the behavioral link between inequality and efficiency. "

In one modification, the public signals are Poisson events and either the observations occur within a small epsilon time interval or the observations have exponential waiting times. In the second modification, the underlying signal is the position of a diffusion process. We show that in the Poisson cases the high-frequency limit is the same as in the Fudenberg and Levine (2007, 2009) study of limits of high-frequency public signals, but that the limits can differ when the signals correspond to a diffusion.

At least two if not more parties need to make decisions under fully or partially conflicting objectives when involved in a dispute or open conflict. By and large decisions must be made under risk, uncertainty, and incomplete or fuzzy information implying large amounts of linguistic and probabilistic information. For cases of two opponents, the synergy of fuzzy control approach and matrix games seems rather effective to represent and find solutions for such multi-criteria conflicting situations. The fuzzy procedure is used to take into account some of the subjective attitudes of the decision makers that are difficult to model using classical game theory. "

It is also demonstrated that in general—and in sharp contrast to other reinforcement learning models in the literature—the asymptotic dynamics of Bush and Mosteller's model cannot be approximated using the continuous time limit version of its expected motion.

The geographical feature effects in two ways: In one way, the geographically-induced network structure influences the overall evolutionary dynamics, and, in the other way, the geographical length of an edge influences the cost when the two players at the two ends interact. For the latter effect, we design a new cost function of cooperators, which simply assumes that the longer the distance between two players, the higher cost the cooperator(s) of them have to pay. In this study, network substrates are generated by a previous spatial network model with a cost-benefit parameter controlling the network topology. Our simulations show that the greatest promotion of cooperation is achieved in the intermediate regime of the parameter, in which empirical estimates of various railway networks fall. Further, we investigate how the distribution of edges’ geographical costs influences the evolutionary dynamics and consider three patterns of the distribution: an approximately-equal distribution, a diverse distribution, and a polarized distribution. For normal geographical networks which are generated using intermediate values of the cost-benefit parameter, a diverse distribution hinders the evolution of cooperation, whereas a polarized distribution lowers the threshold value of the amplification factor for cooperation in public goods game. These results are helpful for understanding the evolution of cooperation on real-world geographical networks. "

In this study, we use game theory as a modeling framework to demonstrate why and how different strategies in predation for both predator and prey are chosen based on body size and energetics. Two distinct and mutually exclusive strategies, active and passive, are considered for both players; hence the corresponding predation can be formulated as a 2 × 2 game. The payoffs are defined using energetics (energy gain and loss), with functional response to predator/prey body size. The game is formulated as a realistic general sum model and the numerical results of Nash equilibrium for different body sized predators and preys are calculated: in general, smaller sized predators and preys tend to use active strategy more often (mixed strategy equilibrium), and larger sized tend to choose active strategy exclusively (pure strategy equilibrium). The long-term evolutionary stability of the predator–prey system is also investigated, and the Nash equilibrium derived from these games are shown evolutionarily unstable. In summary, this study provides a unified modeling framework to study how animal body size and energetics determine predation strategies, and can easily extend to more complicated conditions, such as across multiple trophic levels.

The repeated game has a long-run player whose type is unknown to a group of short-run players. The proposed model assumes a fraction of ‘short-run’ players follow a one-parameter learning model (self-tuning EWA). In addition, some ‘long-run’ players are myopic while others are sophisticated and rationally anticipate how short-run players adjust their actions over time and “teach” the short-run players to maximize their long-run payoffs. All players optimize noisily. The proposed model nests an agent-based quantal-response equilibrium (AQRE) and the standard equilibrium models as special cases. Using data from 28 experimental sessions of trust and entry repeated games, including 8 previously unpublished sessions, the model fits substantially better than chance and much better than standard equilibrium models. Estimates show that most of the long-run players are sophisticated, and short-run players become more sophisticated with experience. "

abstract = "The phenomenon of group escape cannot be explained by an argument of risk dilution, applied to gregarious behaviour of passive prey whose risk of predation is equally shared by all group members (Hamilton, 1971). Instead, individuals at the tail of an escaping group suffer the bulk of the group’s predation risk, and thus have the highest incentive to desert it. Just because of this, desertion, in this case, may serve as a signal of vulnerability for the pursuing predator. Under wide conditions, it is therefore shown that the predator is always expected to prefer the chasing of a deserter, whenever it is observed. Consequently, an individual who finds himself at the tail of the herd must compare the risk of remaining there with that of deserting the herd and thereby becoming a likely target for predation. If the first risk is higher than the latter, the herd disperses; if the latter is higher, the herd cohesively follows the fastest individuals in its lead (we deal also with cases in which only part of the herd disperses). We see, however, that the question which risk is higher depends not only on the terrain, but also on the route of escape that is decided by the fastest members at the lead of the herd, those that are least likely to be caught. Concentrating on herds without family structure, we assume that the route of escape is selfishly chosen by these ad hoc leaders to minimize their own predation risk, regardless of the others’ welfare. However, the predation risk of the leader depends very much on the willingness of other herd members to follow him, thus providing a buffer between him and the pursuing predator. Consequently, when choosing an escape route, the leader has also to consider the cohesion of the herd, i.e., the reaction of slower individuals to his choice. Under some plausible conditions, this choice may force the herd to follow, while other conditions may lead to its dispersal. In some cases the leader may choose a route that serves the needs of the entire group, and sometime only those of its more vulnerable members. In other cases the leader may choose a route that sacrifices the weakest members, thereby improving the survival probability of the others. We employ a model of a k + 1 players game, a single predator, and k heterogeneous prey individuals. The predator aims to maximize the probability of a successful catch, and each individual aims to minimize his probability of being caught. "

The distribution of real wages is determined by the Dixit–Stiglitz–Krugman model in an urban setting, and workers (players) move toward points that offer higher real wages and away from points that offer below-average real wages. This game is described by the replicator equation whose unknown function denotes the distribution of workers. The growth rate of population contains an operator that maps an unknown function to the distribution of real wages. We prove that if the elasticity of substitution and the transport costs are sufficiently small, then the initial value problem for this equation has a unique global solution. We obtain a numerical solution by making use of an iteration scheme. We prove estimates for approximation error in this numerical solution. Moreover we prove that if workers are concentrated at a point at the initial time, then the global solution converges to a long-run equilibrium attained when all workers are concentrated at the point. The highest growth rate is attained at the point and the pure best reply is given at the point. "

The model features two externalities: a strategic externality caused by the fact that the payoff of a coalition depends on the actions of players outside the coalition, and a stock externality caused by the fixed overall amount of waste. The game has a finite time horizon and it is shown that intertemporal core-theoretic cooperation can be sustained under intuitive conditions. "

It is an open problem, whether simple stochastic games can be solved in polynomial time. Our algorithms determine the optimal expected payoffs in the game. We use geometric interpre- tation of the search space as a subset of the hyper-cube [ 0 , 1 ] N . The main idea is to divide this set into convex subregions in which linear optimization methods can be used. We show how one can proceed from one subregion to the other so that, eventually, a region containing the optinal payoffs will be found. The total number of subregions is exponential in the size of the game but, in practice, the algorithms need to visit only few of them to find a solution.

Several classes of no-regret strategies now exist; such strategies secure a long-term average payoff as high as could be obtained by the fixed action that is best, in hindsight, against the observed action sequence of the opponent. We consider an extension of this framework to repeated games with variable stage duration, where the duration of each stage may depend on actions of both players, and the performance measure of interest is the average payoff per unit time. We start by showing that no-regret strategies, in the above sense, do not exist in general. Consequently, we consider two classes of adaptive strategies, one based on Blackwell's approachability theorem and the other on calibrated play, and examine their performance guarantees. We further provide sufficient conditions for existence of no-regret strategies in this model. "

These concepts are shown to (a) imply backward induction in generic perfect information games, and (b) be non-equilibrium analogues to sequential and quasi-perfect equilibrium, leading to epistemic characterizations of the latter concepts.

There is a cost associated to the messages sent, as well as a potential reward. The latter is assumed to depend on the state variable defined as the level of the representative consumer's attention. Two features are included in the model, namely, marginal decreasing returns and bounded rationality. By the latter, we mean that the representative consumer has a limited capacity for processing the information received. The evolution of this capacity depends on its level, as well as on the emails sent by both players. This provides environmental flavour where, usually, one player's pollution emissions (here emails) also affect the payoff of the other player by damaging the common environment (here, the stock of consumer attention). We characterize competitive equilibria for different scenarios based on each player's type, i.e., whether the player is a spammer or not. We define a spammer as a myopic player, i.e., a player who cares only about short-term payoff and ignores the impact of her action on the state dynamics. In all scenarios, the game turns out to be of the linear-quadratic variety. Feedback Nash equilibria for the different scenarios are characterized and the equilibrium strategies and outcomes are compared. Finally, we analyze the game in normal form, where each player has the option of choosing between being a spammer or not, and we characterize Nash equilibria. "

By excluding the invisible hand of mutation we obtain a purely deterministic population model.

Special emphasis is given to an exhaustive combinatorial description of the different basins of attraction corresponding to stable stationary states. "

We describe a generalization of \{OM\} search, called (D,d)-OM search, where D stands for the depth of search by the player and d for the opponent's depth of search. A known difference in search depth can be exploited by purposely choosing a suboptimal variation with the aim to gain a larger advantage than when playing the objectively best move. The difference in search depth may have the result that the opponent does not see the variation in sufficiently deep detail. We then give a pruning alternative for (D,d)-OM search, denoted by α-β2 pruning. A best-case analysis shows that α-β2 prunes very efficiently, comparable to the efficiency of α-β with regard to minimax. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is confirmed by simulations using a game-tree model including an opponent model and by experiments in the domain of Othello. "

Our results cover the case when the action sets are taken to be the unit interval, results now known to be false when they are based on more familiar measure spaces such as the Lebesgue unit interval. We also emphasize three criteria for the modelling of such game-theoretic situations—asymptotic implementability, homogeneity and measurability—and argue for games on hyperfinite Loeb spaces on the basis of these criteria. In particular, we show through explicit examples that a sequence of finite games with an increasing number of players or sample points cannot always be represented by a limit game on a Lebesgue space, and even when it can be so represented, the limit of an existing approximate equilibrium may disappear in the limit game. Thus, games on hyperfinite Loeb spaces constitute the `right' model even if one is primarily interested in capturing the asymptotic nature of large but finite game-theoretic phenomena. "

Guild membership can be beneficial to game progress, and offer opportunities for social interaction. In the current study we focus on the \{MMORPG\} World of Warcraft (WoW), with the main aim to examine whether guild commitment and players’ intention to remain in their guild can be predicted by players’ satisfaction, investments, and perceptions of alternatives to their guild. To this end, 165 WoW players completed an online questionnaire and answered questions related to their guild membership. They also completed the investment model scale which was reworded so all questions pertained to their guild and their fellow guild members. Results show that satisfaction level, quality of alternatives, and investment size significantly predict commitment level (p’s &lt; .001), which in turn predicted likelihood of participants’ staying with their current guild (p &lt; .001) and the number of guilds they had been a member of in the past (p &lt; .001). Moreover, high levels of guild commitment were indicative of better mental health, whereas weekly hours of game play was negatively related to mental health. In the discussion, we conclude that interdependence theory and the investment model of commitment are applicable to online gaming environments, and we argue that commitment to one’s guild is one factor that could prevent the risks associated with online game play (i.e. problematic use).

The related transferable utility cooperative games are called permutation games. We consider the large subclass of so-called cyclic permutation games, and show how the nucleolus of an n-player cyclic permutation game can be computed by a known O(n4) algorithm directly from the underlying data. We also demonstrate that this approach might not work if for the group of all participants the optimal course of action is not given by a permutation consisting of a single cycle. "

The micro-panel data used to investigate this issue consist of weekly prices, sales, costs and promotional activity for three brands of saltine crackers sold by four chains of grocery stores in a small \{US\} town.

The psychological effect has recently been introduced in behavioral models of situations where agents are uncertain about their own willingness-to-pay, while the mechanical effect is well captured by standard auction theory. Controlling for censoring when players are not sold, both effects are observed. Once we account for the potential endogeneity of reserve prices, however, we do not find evidence for reference dependence in Hattrick auctions. "

By modeling virtual networks as competing players and giving the pricing mechanism which decided by the physical substrate network and to guarantee efficiency, the schema can achieve optimal bandwidth allocation at the Nash equilibrium point of the game. We prove that the scheme admits a unique equilibrium point. Experimental results show that the bandwidth allocation between virtual networks is efficient and fair. "

First, Rosen's results about the existence and uniqueness of a Nash normalised equilibrium for coupled constraint games are explained. These results are then combined with a numerical approach to game solutions based on the Nikaido–Isoda function. A river basin pollution game, which is a model for a common nonpoint source pollution problem, is solved numerically using this approach. In the game, the agents face a joint constraint on the total pollution, which defines a coupled constraint set in the combined strategy space. This makes the game special in terms of the strategy spaces. Unlike for standard games where they are defined separately for each player, here we have a joint constraint on the combined strategy space of all players. Hence, the game needs coupled constraint equilibrium as the solution concept. Static and (open-loop) dynamic equilibria are computed for the basin problem under the discussed equilibrium concept. All equilibria are instructive for the legislator, in that they contain information on how to choose the “optimal” charges, under which agents obey the constraints. "

So a bilevel approach combines a system-optimum problem, at the upper level, with the carrier equilibrium problem, at the lower level. The choice behaviour of the lower-level player is simulated by a random utility model. The output of the game suggests that private companies and society should share the investments and the public contribution should be high; furthermore, transhipment and consolidation services should be concentrated at few terminals to exploit fully economies of scale at the expense of the average travel time to reach the logistic platforms.

In order to formulate the problem, a game-theoretical multi-objective model with the objective of maximizing investor utility is presented. In the proposed method, an acceptance threshold constraint is applied to facility allocation that is based on a combination of distance between a facility and clients, and investors’ product prices. Since the common solution methods for multi-objective optimization, such as weighted sums, ε-constraints, multi-objective meta-heuristic algorithms, etc. are not efficient enough, and cannot guarantee achieving Nash equilibrium points, a new approach is developed to solve the presented problem. Moreover, according to the computational complexity of the problem, an approximation algorithm is introduced for large-sized problems. Finally, the computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs efficiently in obtaining Nash equilibrium points. "

Finally, an n-person, non-zero-sum, non-cooperative game is constructed to handle the mutual occlusion problem. The individual targets within the occlusion region are regarded as the players in the constructed game to compete for the maximum utilities by using the certain strategies. A Nash Equilibrium of the game is the optimal estimation of the locations of the players within the occlusion region.

However, a rational individual incorporates environment into its fitness to develop itself only when environment is dominant in real life. Here, we redefine the individual fitness as a linear combination of inheritance and environment when environment performs better than inheritance. Multiple Monte Carlo simulation results show that incorporating dominant environment can improve cooperation comparing with the traditional case, and furthermore increasing the proportion of prevailing environment can enhance cooperative level better. These findings indicate that our mechanism enhances the individual ability to adapt environment, and makes the spatial reciprocity more efficient. Besides, we also verify its robustness against different game models and various topology structures. "

We also prove a generalization of the Crawford puzzle by identifying a broad class of learning rules that cannot produce exponential stability of solution points. "

One type of interpersonal interaction that involves this sort of complex reasoning about others’ minds is an economic game, and because economic games have been extensively modeled in behavioral economics, they provide a unique testbed for a quantitative and precise analysis of cognitive functioning in ASD. This study specifically asked whether \{ASD\} is associated with strategic depth in the economic game known as The Beauty Contest, in which all players submit a number from 0 to 100, and the winner is the player who submits the number closest to 2/3 of the mean of all numbers submitted. Unexpectedly, the distribution of responses among adult participants with \{ASD\} reflected a level of strategic reasoning at least as deep as that of their neurotypical peers, with the same proportion of participants with \{ASD\} being characterized as “higher order” strategic players. Thus, whatever mentalistic reasoning abilities are necessary for typical performance in the context of this economic game appear to be largely intact, and therefore unlikely to be fundamental to persistent social dysfunction in ASD.

The results revealed that the best form of cooperation is the one in which the large truck-operating company would establish a coalition with the ship-operating company; that is, vertical cooperation. This cooperation would generate better payoffs in the form of profit, not only to the members of this coalition, but also to the player that has not joined the coalition. However, user surplus is negative in all coalitions, which shows that the establishment of these kinds of cooperation is not beneficial (in terms of prices) for the users of these service providers.

We conduct experiments with a larger number of repetitions than in previous work in order to test this prediction. We find that when subjects are given minimal information, only after close to 100 periods do subjects begin to approach equilibrium. In contrast, with full information, subjects learn to play a pure strategy equilibrium relatively quickly. However, the information which permits rapid convergence, revelation of the individual play of all opponents, is not predicted to have any effect by existing models of learning. "

This study shows the existence of an equilibrium coordinated routing decision for the mixed-strategy routing game and the convergence of the distributed algorithm to the equilibrium routing decision, assuming individual smart vehicles are selfish players seeking to minimize their own travel time. Numerical experiments conducted based on Sioux Falls city network indicate that the proposed distributed algorithm converges quickly under different smart vehicle penetrations, thus it possesses a great potential for online applications. Moreover, the proposed coordinated routing mechanism outperforms traditional independent selfish-routing mechanism; it reduces travel time for both overall system and individual vehicles, which represents the core idea of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS).

abstract = "Abstract Some researchers support the belief that man evolved philandering behavior because of the greater reproductive success of promiscuous males. According to this idea, deserting behavior from the man should be expected along with null paternal involvement in offspring care. Paradoxically however, the average offspring investment in the human male is far higher than that of any other male mammal, including other primates. In our work, we have addressed this conundrum by employing evolutionary game theory, using objective payoffs instead of, as are commonly used, arbitrary payoffs. Payoffs were computed as reproductive successes by a model based on trivial probabilities, implemented within the Barreto’s Population Dynamics Toolbox (2014). The evolution of the parent conflict was simulated by a game with two players (the woman and the man). First, a simple game was assayed with two strategies, ‘desert-unfaithful’ and ‘care-faithful’. Then, the game was played with a third mixed strategy, ‘care-unfaithful’. The two-strategy game results were mainly determined by the offspring survival rate (s) and the non-paternity rate (z), with remaining factors playing a secondary role. Starting from two empirical estimates for both rates (s = 0.617 and z = 0.033) and decreasing the offspring mortality from near 0.4 to 0.1, the results were consistent with a win for the ‘care-faithful’ strategy. The ‘desert-unfaithful’ strategy only won at unrealistically high non-paternity rates (z&gt;0.2). When three-strategy games were played, the mixed strategy of ‘care-unfaithful’ man could win the game in some less frequent cases. Regardless of the number of game strategies, ‘care’ fathers always won. These results strongly suggest that offspring mortality was the key factor in the evolution of paternal investment within the Homo branch. The ‘care-faithful’ strategy would have been the main strategy in human evolution but ‘care-unfaithful’ men did evolve at a lesser frequency. It can therefore be concluded that human populations, under most of the likely ecological situations, would arrive at a polymorphic state where alternative strategies might be present in significant quantity.

Traditional game theory, which assumes selfish and rational players, predicts the largest and efficient coalition with a proposer exploiting most of the total value. In a stochastic evolutionary model (the frequency-dependent Moran process with mutations) where players make errors in estimating the payoffs and strategies of others, evolutionary selection favors the formation of a two-person subcoalition under weak selection and in the low mutation limit if and only if its coalition value exceeds a high proportion (0.7) of that of the largest coalition. Proposers offer 30–35% of the subcoalition value to a coalition member, excluding a non-member. Multilateral bargaining is critically different from the bilateral one. Coalition-forming behavior may cause economic inefficiency and social exclusion. Stochastic evolutionary game theory thus provides theoretical support to explain the behavior of human subjects in economic experiments of a three-person ultimatum game. "

In each case, we characterize the set of equilibria, in some cases establishing existence of a unique equilibrium as well as briefly pointing out some interesting comparative static properties. We also study the weakest-link and best-shot limits of the \{CES\} composition function and show how the former can be used for equilibrium selection and the latter to establish that equilibria of some better-shot games are identical to those of the much simpler best-shot game.

In one model the type of an agent is fixed and evolution works on strategies of types. In the other model every agent adopts with fixed probabilities both types, and type-contingent strategies are exposed to evolution. It is shown that the dynamic stability properties of equilibria may differ even when there are only two types and two strategies.

Examples illustrating these results are provided. "

The paper shows that the degree of correlation between unit profits and market volume might result in different value functions and triggers, especially for followers and simultaneous investors in non-pre-emptive games. Monopoly-like volume is a critical determinant of the leader's trigger in both pre-emptive and non-pre-emptive games. First-mover advantages are significant in the definition of the leader's optimal entry moment, if the players are fighting for the leader's position (pre-emptive game). "

That maximising and minimising are not (simply) duals is due to the use of least fixed-points in both cases, as is normal for iterating programs. (For duality, we would have to use greatest fixed-points in the maximising case.) The significance of that extension is that it makes a further link between the program-logical approach and the more general methods for finding control strategies that “solve” games of this kind, in the sense of giving the player a “recipe” which, if followed, will deliver the theoretically optimal result.

The Nash equilibrium shows that, regardless of the organizations that have already existed in the market, joining the market is always the best policy for the remaining organizations which are currently not in the market. Similarly, India likes the organization to which it belongs, i.e. IOR-ARC, to trade with the \{EU\} and APEC, and the U.S. wants the organization to which it belongs, i.e., APEC, to cooperate with the organizations \{USAN\} and IOR-ARC.

The case that there exist two groups of players with a conflict interest in the game is considered, and the players in each group must make their own decisions by taking into account the group interest. A method is proposed to find the approximate strategy for every player which will lead to an O(||μ||) near saddle–point equilibrium. "

An important ingredient of our approach is the way we model partner choice: we suppose that a player can establish ties with other players by unilaterally investing in costly pairwise links. In this context, individual efforts to balance the costs and benefits of links are shown to lead to a unique equilibrium interaction architecture. The dynamics of network formation, however, has powerful effects on individual behavior: if costs of forming links are below a certain threshold then players coordinate on the risk-dominant action, while if costs are above this threshold then they coordinate on the efficient action. These findings are robust to modifications in the link formation process, different specifications of link formation costs, alternative models of mutations as well as the possibility of interaction among indirectly connected players.

In this paper, we study the problems of physical layer security and energy efficiency through power control and relays’ cooperation, where both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward protocols are considered. We propose an one-leader one-follower Stackelberg (OLOFS) game model in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers, where optimal power allocation and pricing strategy can be determined to maximize the players’ utilities. We also present a best relay selection criterion for \{OLOFS\} game model in both perfect channel state information (CSI) and imperfect \{CSI\} scenarios, which maximizes the secrecy capacity of the network. A distributed learning algorithm, inspired by the stochastic learning automata, is then proposed to achieve the equilibrium of the proposed games. Finally, we derive closed-form intercept probability expressions of the direct transmission scheme and the proposed game model over Rayleigh fading channels in both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward protocols. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed game model improves network energy efficiency and has an improved performance against eavesdropping attacks, in comparison to Nash equilibrium, rand, and direct transmission schemes. We can also reduce the intercept probability by choosing a different relaying protocol (decode-and-forward or amplify-and-forward), based on the characteristic of channels in the proposed model. "

For the class of population games for which the underlying game has identical interests, we show that, independently of the matching technology, any myopic-best reply dynamics converges (in probability) to a correlated equilibrium. We also analyze noisy best reply dynamics, where players’ behaviour is perturbed by payoff-dependent mistakes, and explicitly characterize the limit distribution of the perturbed game in terms of the correlated equilibrium payoff of the underlying game.

A distributed \{P2P\} architecture that uses “Coordinator” nodes for handling smaller groups of players has been shown to be especially effective in supporting MMOGs. However, the drawback of moving from centralized to distributed architectures is the loss of control, and more specifically the increase in the vulnerability of the system as a whole to compromises. There has been no prior work on handling the specific case when the Coordinator itself is compromised and cheats, a scenario akin to cheating conducted by the network. We address this problem by proposing an architecture that is resilient to Coordinator compromises and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture. We believe that this is an essential step towards enabling a widespread deployment of P2P-based MMOGs. "

The notion of rationality entails the exploration of the marginal decision rule from economic theory, which states that a rational individual evaluates his/her marginal utility, defined as the difference between the marginal benefit and the marginal cost, of each incremental decision. Seeking to analyze the marginal decision rule in the modeling of deterministic day-to-day traffic evolution, this paper proposes a modeling framework which introduces a term to capture the marginal cost to the driver induced by route switching. The proposed framework enables to capture both benefit and cost associated with route changes. The marginal cost is then formulated upon the assumption that drivers are able to predict other drivers’ responses to the current traffic conditions, which is adopted based on the notion of strategic thinking of rational players developed in behavior game theory. The marginal cost based on 1-step strategic thinking also describes the “shadow price” of shifting routes, which helps to explain the behavioral tendency of the driver perceiving the cost-sensitivity to link/route flows. After developing a formulation of the marginal utility day-to-day model, its theoretical properties are analyzed, including the invariance property, asymptotic stability, and relationship with the rational behavioral adjustment process.

We establish the existence and uniqueness of the paired trajectories of society's preferences and behavior.

The characteristic of equilibrium states in N-company spot markets modelled by uniform pricing auctions is analyzed and a new method for obtaining Nash equilibriums of the auctions is proposed. Spot markets are assumed to be operated as uniform pricing auctions and generation companies are assumed to submit their bids into the auctions in the form of a seal-bid. The uniform pricing auctions in this analysis are formulated as non-cooperative and static games in which generation companies correspond to the players of the game. The coefficient of the bidding function of company-n is assigned to the strategy of the player-n (company-n) and the payoff of player-n is defined as its profit from the uniform price auction. Based on the concept of residual demand, best response functions of each generation company in the N-company auctions are analytically derived. Finally, an efficient way to obtain all the possible equilibrium set pairs and to examine their feasibilities as Nash equilibriums are suggested. A simple numerical example with three generation companies is demonstrated to show the basic ideas of the proposed method. "

However, as we show, when such points are on the boundary of the state space, for example, pure strategy equilibria, standard results from the theory of stochastic approximation do not apply. We offer what we believe to be the correct treatment of boundary points, and provide a new and more general result: this model of learning converges with zero probability to fixed points which are unstable under the Maynard Smith or adjusted version of the evolutionary replicator dynamics. For two player games these are the fixed points that are linearly unstable under the standard replicator dynamics. "

However, the numerical simulation shows that the system may present a periodic and chaotic status when the speed of price adjustment is higher. The effect of the degree of horizontal differentiation on the stability of Nash equilibrium of the system is also discussed. We have a different conclusion from Lucino Fanti and Luca Gori's (2012); that is the greater the degree of product horizontal differentiation is, the more stable the Nash equilibrium of the system is.

Few studies, to date, have investigated risk factors for soccer injuries using a multivariate survival model (e.g., Cox regression). The aim of this study was to use a multivariate survival model to investigate factors associated with an increased risk of thigh muscle strains, in young soccer players. A multivariate Cox regression was used to evaluate survival probability predictors for thigh muscle strains. 84 young male soccer players (16.4 ± 1.6 years) were followed for a season. Baseline tests were performed for body size, body composition, endurance, flexibility, and jump height from both a static position (SJ), and with a countermovement (CMJ); the percentage difference between the two types of jumps was also calculated (ΔJH). Cox regression result (hazard ratio; C.I. 95%) showed that: previous injuries (2.80; 1.19–6.54), ΔJH (0.79; 0.71–0.87), and stature (1.17; 1.06–1.25) were significantly correlated to thigh-strain survival probability. This study confirms that previous injuries are an important risk factor. However, we also report that a negative ΔJH and an elevated stature increased the probability of thigh strain. This could be explained by poor player coordination, influencing jumping ability, which may be even more evident in tall young players. "

Based on a sample of 2227 members and 41 leaders in 30 video game communities, the research demonstrated the use of a two-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine the relationships of \{VC\} leaders and members, appropriately adjusted for a nested structure. The results indicated that leaders who engage in higher levels of involvement in \{VC\} are more likely to have members who agree with and respond to the community. Furthermore, member- and leader-level factors were significantly associated with member satisfaction: knowledge sharing, usefulness, and enjoyability explained within-VC variance while leader involvement explained between-VC variance. Finally, member satisfaction demonstrated positive effects on both member loyalty and intention to use. The study further discussed the implications of these findings, offering direction for future research. "

Once feasible outcomes are properly defined, the core concept is standard - no permissible coalition can improve upon its outcome. We provide a sufficient condition for the nonemptiness of the core in the case where the players can be divided into a finite number of types. This result is applied to a market game and the nonemptiness of the core of the market game is stated under considerably weak conditions (but with finite types). In addition, it is illustrated that the framework applies to assignment games with a continuum of players. "

Prisoners’ dilemmas or coordination games are played repeatedly within neighbourhoods where players do not optimise but instead copy successful strategies. Discriminative behaviour of players is introduced representing strategies as small automata, which can be in different states against different neighbours. Extensive simulations show that cooperation persists even in a stochastic environment, that players do not always coordinate on risk dominant equilibria in 2×2 coordination games, and that success among surviving strategies may differ. We present two analytical models that help understanding of these phenomena. "

Further, the players experiment with myopically suboptimal strategies whenever there are potential gains from trade. We establish an isomorphism between the set of absorbing states of the process and the set of core allocations, and show that the process converges to one of these states with probability one whenever the core is non-empty.

As some parameters of the model are varied, the stability of the Nash equilibrium point is lost and the complex (periodic or chaotic) behavior occurs.

The scenario of the game is that of a player interacting with embodied fairy-tale characters in a 3D world via spoken dialogue (supplemented by graphical pointing actions) to solve various problems. The player himself cannot directly perform actions in the world, but interacts with the fairy-tale characters to have them perform various tasks, and to get information about the world and the problems to solve. Hence the role of spoken dialogue as the primary means of control is obvious and natural to the player. Naturally, this means that robust spoken language understanding becomes a critical component. To this end, the paper describes a semantic representation formalism and an accompanying parsing algorithm which works off the output of the speech recogniser’s statistical language model. The evaluation shows that the parser is robust in the sense of considerably improving on the noisy output of the speech recogniser. "

Most of the existing clustering methods have focused on optimizing a single clustering objective. Often, several recent disciplines such as robot team deployment, ad hoc networks, multi-agent systems, facility location, etc., need to consider multiple criteria, often conflicting, during clustering. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a sequential game theoretic approach for multi-objective clustering, called ClusSMOG-II. It is specially designed to optimize simultaneously intrinsically conflicting objectives, which are inter-cluster/intra-cluster inertia and connectivity. This technique has an advantage of keeping the number of clusters dynamic. The approach consists of three main steps. The first step sets initial clusters with their representatives, whereas the second step calculates the correct number of clusters by resolving a sequence of multi-objective multi-act sequential two-player games for conflict-clusters. Finally, the third step constructs homogenous clusters by resolving sequential two-player game between each cluster representative and the representative of its nearest neighbor. For each game, we define payoff functions that correspond to the model objectives. We use a methodology based on backward induction to calculate a pure Nash equilibrium for each game. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. "

However, along with the influence of recombination on evolution, we understand surprisingly little of how selection shapes the nature of recombination. One explanation for recombination is that it allows organisms to escape from perilous situations where they experience very low fitness. As a corollary, it has been suggested that selection should favor recombination at low fitness and not at high fitness (fitness-associated recombination, FAR), and theory suggests that such strategies can indeed be selected. Here we develop models to further investigate the evolution of FAR. Consistent with previous works, we find that \{FAR\} can invade and dominate over a strategy of uniform recombination that is independent of fitness. However, our simulation results suggest that extreme \{FAR\} strategies, known as group-elitism, are not necessarily superior to other \{FAR\} strategies. Moreover, we argue that \{FAR\} domination will often occur with a net loss of mean population fitness. Interestingly, this suggests that the strategy of not recombining at high fitness will sometimes be analogous to a defector strategy from the famous “prisoner's dilemma” game: a selfish strategy that is selected but leads to a loss of mean fitness for all players.

Interactions will be modeled by Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD) with two players and two actions game, setting either a game against the field or a population game. Individual chromosomes contain the information of the probability of cooperation for the players. Moreover, individuals characteristics like lifetime, amount of life and caused death (last two related to games payoff) are used to evaluate an individual success and to formalize this evaluation, eleven fitness functions are used. Population is modeled by Continuous Probabilistic Cellular Automata (CPCA) and Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE), and a relation between two approaches is explored.

The immersive voice communication service enables each avatar to hear a spatially accurate audio mix of the conversations in its hearing range. There are three primary delivery architectures for this service, namely, peer-to-peer, central server, and distributed servers. We focus on a distributed server architecture, which partitions the virtual world into regions or locales and then assigns the computation associated with the creation of audio scenes for all avatars in each locale to a server. Our aim is to find the optimal way to partition the virtual world into locales and then choose the locale servers in such a way that reduces the total delay perceived by all avatars. We have produced a mathematical formulation for the optimal partitioning and server assignment and developed a heuristics approach based on a graph algorithm. We have developed a simulation environment that creates both the physical world (geographic distribution of participants and the Internet topology model) and the virtual world (distribution of avatars based on different avatar aggregation behaviors). We have solved the problem exactly as well as using the heuristics for a range of simulated virtual and physical worlds. In many cases, the heuristics results were within 5% of the optimal. Our algorithms and simulation study will be of benefit to future immersive voice communication service providers in the design of a cost effective delivery architecture for this service. "

But what about multiplayer symmetric zero-sum games? This paper shows that these games might also have only asymmetric equilibria. One of the examples employed to illustrate this point is the three-candidate version of the popular Hotelling–Downs model of electoral competition. This demonstrates that symmetric games with only asymmetric equilibria are not technical paradoxes but are integrated in economics and political science literature for quite a while. "

The proposed algorithm comprises four steps. At the first step, we introduce an automatic grass field extraction algorithm that is tested for various soccer video types and conditions. The field line marks, which are used to locate the players, are detected at the second step using Hough Transform and tracked in all frames by predicting their positions using Kalman Filter. At the third step, we introduce a novel approach for estimating the players’ positions during the course of tracking players. We estimate a player’s position in the current frame by observing his position in the old frame within the soccer field model, using Perspective Transformation of the old frame to the real world coordinate system, and then by projecting back the obtained player’s position into the current frame. At the final step, the players are tracked by applying the region-based detection algorithm, the Histogram Back-Projection algorithm or a combination of the Merge-Split approach and the Template-Matching algorithm around the estimated positions, depending on whether or not the occlusion has occurred and if yes, how it has occurred. Then their memberships are identified by an algorithm that employs both appearance and spatial information of the players. Image sequences of different soccer games were captured from different sources, and all experiments were performed off-line. The results of our experimentations show that our algorithm is highly robust to occlusion, different soccer field colours, different lights such as sunlight and spotlight, shadows of players and fading the whole screen due to fast camera movements.

A novel competitive influence model is additionally proposed that incorporates user heterogeneity, message content, and network structure. The proposed game-theoretic model is solved using Nash Equilibrium in a real-world dataset. It is shown that none of the well-known strategies are stable and at least one player has the incentive to deviate from the proposed strategy. Moreover, violation of Nash equilibrium strategy by each player leads to their reduced payoff. Contrary to previous works, our results demonstrate that graph topology, as well as the nodes’ sociability and initial tendency measures have an effect on the determination of the influential node in the network.

Finding a connected Nash network which guarantees a given payoff to each player proves to be an NP-hard problem. For the associated evolutionary game with asynchronous updating and logit updating rules, the stochastically stable networks are characterized. The organization of agents into networks has an important role in the communication of information within a spatial structure. One goal is to understand how such networks form and evolve over time. Our agents are endowed with some information which can be accessed by other agents forming links with them. Link formation is costly and communication not fully reliable. We model the process of network formation as a non-cooperative game, and we then focus on Nash networks. But, showing existence of a Nash network with particular properties and computing one are two different tasks. The aim of this paper is to show that computing a connected Nash network is a computationally demanding optimization problem. The question then arises what outcomes might be chosen by agents who would like to form a connected Nash network but fail to achieve their goal because of computational limitations. We propose a stochastic evolutionary model. By solving a companion global optimization problem, this model selects a subset of Nash networks referred to as the set of stochastically stable networks.

They provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the form of equilibrium strategies and plays. In contrast to the “folk theorem,” these structural properties place severe restrictions on the set of equilibrium paths and payoffs. For example, only sequences of the one-shot Nash equilibrium can be generated by any \{ESF\} of the repeated game of chicken. "

We focus on the core of these games under an allocation scheme that determines how payoffs are distributed before the uncertainty is realized, and allows for arbitrarily different distributions for each realization of the uncertainty. Assuming that each player’s preferences over random payoffs are represented by a concave monetary utility functional, we prove that these games have a nonempty core. Furthermore, by establishing a connection between stochastic linear programming games, linear programming games and linear semi-infinite programming games, we show that an allocation in the core can be computed efficiently under some circumstances.

In a correlated equilibrium, players rationally condition their strategies on realizations of a common external randomization device and, as a consequence, can achieve payoffs that Pareto dominate any of the game's Nash equilibria. In this paper we explore whether such correlated equilibria can be learned over time using an evolutionary learning model where agents do not start with any knowledge of the distribution of random draws made by the external randomization device. Furthermore, we validate our learning algorithm findings by comparing the end behavior of simulations of our algorithm with both the correlated equilibrium of the game and the behavior of human subjects that play that same game. Our results suggest that the evolutionary learning model is capable of learning the correlated equilibria of these games in a manner that approximates well the learning behavior of human subjects and that our findings are robust to changes in the specification and parameterization of the model.

The experiment consists of several periods of repeated play under alternative feedback conditions, including no-feedback conditions in which players receive no information between periods. If learning takes place only through reinforcement resulting from experienced outcomes, choices in the no-feedback conditions should not converge towards the Nash equilibrium. While less than under full information, there is convergence towards the equilibrium prediction in the no-feedback conditions. Varying priming given to subjects between periods does not affect the results. "

One such alternative is to model the goals of the players, and their strategies for achieving these goals. This approach means searching the space of possible goal expansions, typically much smaller than the space of move sequences. Previous attempts to apply these techniques to Go have been unable to provide results for anything other than a high strategic level or very open game positions. In this paper we describe how adversarial hierarchical task network planning can provide a framework for goal-directed game playing in Go which is also applicable both strategic and tactical problems.

Among these multiple communication paths with different characteristics and properties at each time step, the sensor needs to choose a single channel for sending data packets while reducing the probability of being attacked. In the meanwhile, the attacker needs to decide the target channel to jam under an energy budget constraint. To model this interactive decision-making process between the two sides, we formulate a two-player zero-sum stochastic game framework. A Nash Q-learning algorithm is proposed to tackle the computation complexity when solving the optimal strategies for both players. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the obtained results.

The challenge then lies in sustaining cooperative mitigation against the temptation to free-ride on others' contributions, which can undermine public endeavours. When all possible future scenarios entail costs, however, the rationale for contributing to a public good changes from altruistic sacrifice of personal profit to necessary investment in minimizing personal debt. Here we demonstrate analytically how an economic framework of costly adaptation to climate change can sustain cooperative mitigation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We develop game-theoretic scenarios from existing examples of insurance for adaptation to natural hazards exacerbated by climate-change that bring the debt burden from future climate events into the present. We model the as-yet untried potential for leveraging public contributions to mitigation from personal costs of adaptation insurance, by discounting the insurance premium in proportion to progress towards a mitigation target. We show that collective mitigation targets are feasible for individuals as well as nations, provided that the premium for adaptation insurance in the event of no mitigation is at least four times larger than the mitigation target per player. This prediction is robust to players having unequal vulnerabilities, wealth, and abilities to pay. We enumerate the effects of these inequalities on payoffs to players under various sub-optimal conditions. We conclude that progress in mitigation is hindered by its current association with a social dilemma, which disappears upon confronting the bleak consequences of inaction. "

Cultural consensus analysis revealed broadly shared understandings among players about online gaming involvement and its positive consequences, but less agreement about negative scale items. Our findings suggest the need for caution in employing current tools to assess “addictive” and “disordered” gaming, as our gamer respondents judged commonly used scale items, such as cognitive salience, withdrawal, and tolerance, as not fitting with their own understandings and experiences. We argue that our approach, rooted in gamers' actual experiences and also current theory, contributes to more valid psychiatric assessments of online gaming experiences, though more research is needed to refine the new measures we present.

Our method allowed us to predict whether the decision process would lead to equilibrium choices or not, and to attribute out-of-equilibrium responses to limited cognitive capacities or social motives. Our results suggest the existence of individually heterogeneous-but-stable patterns of visual information acquisition based on subjective levels of strategic sophistication and social preferences. "

In such games, unlike the static problems without contracting possibilities, the cooperation between players is possible due to the fact that the realization of negotiated agreements can be enforced by suitably-defined strategies. The definition presented combines dynamic programming, the theory of bargaining and the notion of enforceable agreements to produce a class of cooperative solutions defined in the form of memory Nash equilibria satisfying the principle of optimality along the equilibrium trajectory. The choice of a particular solution in this class depends on players' expected actions in case of disagreement, and on an adopted negotiation scheme formalized in the form of a bargaining model. Possible formulations of disagreement policies and bargaining models are discussed in some detail. "

In Experiments 2–4, learning occurred rarely in multiplayer groups, even when players were informed that they were interacting strategically and were allowed to communicate with one another but were not aware of the game’s payoff structure.

Solution concepts, such as Nash equilibrium, have been defined in order to predict the outcome of such situations. In multi-player settings, it has been pointed out that to be realistic, a solution concept should be obtainable via processes that are decentralized and reasonably simple. Accordingly we look at the computation of solution concepts by means of decentralized dynamics. These are algorithms in which players move in turns to decrease their own cost and the hope is that the system reaches an “equilibrium” quickly. We study these dynamics for the class of opinion games, recently introduced by Bindel et al. [10]. These are games, important in economics and sociology, that model the formation of an opinion in a social network. We study best-response dynamics and show upper and lower bounds on the convergence to Nash equilibria. We also study a noisy version of best-response dynamics, called logit dynamics, and prove a host of results about its convergence rate as the noise in the system varies. To get these results, we use a variety of techniques developed to bound the mixing time of Markov chains, including coupling, spectral characterizations and bottleneck ratio. "

This characterization does not apply to discounted games with sufficiently patient players. We show that in a class of public good games, the set of Nash equilibrium payoffs of the undiscounted game can be empty, while limit (perfect Bayesian) Nash equilibrium payoffs of the discounted game, as players become increasingly patient, do exist. These equilibria share some features with the ones of two-sided reputation models. "

Solutions for efficient and synergistic cooperation among objects are, therefore, required. This paper suggests a novel paradigm to support dynamic cooperation among private/public local clouds of IoT devices. Differently from device-oriented approaches typical of Mobile Cloud Computing, the proposed paradigm envisages an IoT Cloud Provider (ICP)-oriented cooperation, which allows all devices belonging to the same private/public owner to participate in the federation process. Expected result from dynamic federations among \{ICPs\} is a remarkable increase in the amount of service requests being satisfied. Different from the Fog Computing vision, the network edge provides only management support and supervision to the proposed Mobile-IoT-Federation-as-a-Service (MIFaaS), thus reducing the deployment cost of peripheral micro data centers. The paper proposes a coalition formation game to account for the interest of rational cooperative \{ICPs\} in their own payoff. A proof-of-concept performance evaluation confirms that obtained coalition structures not only guarantee the satisfaction of the players’ requirements according to their utility function, but also these introduce significant benefits for the cooperating \{ICPs\} in terms of number of tasks being successfully assigned.

The distinction is critical because biases produce effects at the aggregate level that then feed back to influence individual behavior. This study presents an economic experiment designed specifically to see if players use social information in a biased way. The experiment was conducted among a group of subsistence pastoralists in southern Bolivia. Treatments were designed to test for two widely discussed forms of biased social learning: a tendency to imitate success and a tendency to follow the majority. The analysis, based primarily on fitting specific evolutionary models to the data using maximum likelihood, found neither a clear tendency to imitate success nor conformity. Players instead seemed to rely largely on private feedback about their own personal histories of choices and payoffs. Nonetheless, improved performance in one treatment provides evidence for some important but currently unspecified social effect. Given existing experimental work on cultural transmission from other societies, the current study suggests that social learning is potentially conditional and culturally specific. "

The paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways. First, by making a comparison with the complete information case it formally describes a set of conditions under which allowing for private information in payoffs facilitates the identification of various features of the game. Second, focusing on the incomplete information case it presents an estimation procedure based on the equilibrium properties of the game that relies on weak semiparametric assumptions and relatively flexible information structures which allow players to condition their beliefs on signals whose exact distribution function is unknown to the researcher. The proposed estimators recover unobserved beliefs by solving a semiparametric sample analog of the population Bayesian–Nash equilibrium conditions. The asymptotic features of such estimators are studied for the case in which the distribution of unobserved shocks is known and the case in which it is unknown. In both instances equilibrium uniqueness is assumed to hold only in a neighborhood of the true parameter value and for a subset Z of realizations of the signals. Multiple equilibria are allowed elsewhere in the parameter space and no equilibrium selection theory is involved. Extensions to games where beliefs are conditioned on unobservables as well as general games with many players and actions are also discussed. An empirical application of a simple capital investment game is included. "

Methods Injuries, game participation and training participation were collected weekly by 8 \{AFL\} clubs for 61 emerging and 64 established players. Injury incidence rates (IIR) and Cox proportional hazard models for time to first injury, separately for games and training, were computed. Results The game \{IIR\} was significantly higher for emerging than established players: 45.6 (95% CI: 35.7, 57.6) versus 18.3 (95% CI: 13.1, 24.9) per 1000 game-hours. Emerging players also had a higher training \{IIR\} than did the established players: 9.6 (95% CI: 7.6, 11.9) versus 8.9 (95% CI: 7.0, 11.1) per 1000 training-hours. Emerging players were significantly less likely to remain injury free in games than established players (HR = 3.46, 95% CI: 1.27, 9.45). A similar outcome was seen in training sessions, although to a lesser degree (HR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.69). Conclusions Despite efforts to modify the playing/training program of emerging players, this group remain at greater risk of injury in games and training sessions, compared with established players. Continued efforts should be made toward understanding reasons for this increased risk to better prevent injury during the early years of a professional football career. "

To investigate the necessity of this questionable and restrictive assumption, we model heterogeneity in consumers’ distance perceptions by individual edge lengths of a given graph. A profile of location choices is called a “robust equilibrium” if it is a Nash equilibrium in several games which differ only by the consumers’ perceptions of distances. For a finite number of players and any distribution of consumers, we provide a complete characterization of robust equilibria and derive structural conditions for their existence. Furthermore, we discuss whether the classical observations of minimal differentiation and inefficiency are robust phenomena. Thereby, we find strong support for an old conjecture that in equilibrium firms form local clusters. "

Palm biomass are plentiful; yet their utilization are far from reaching their potential. From the perspective of biomass industry players, especially of the bio-energy industry, there are primarily three factors affecting their business decision: (i) constant and good quality supplies, (ii) process efficiency, (iii) market demand and price. The strategy considerations that respond to these factors are based on other players' competition, plantation output, mill output, logistics matter, government policy and weather. In order to model a real situation in a particular palm plantation area, game theory approach is adopted in analysing and identifying the best strategy for the biomass industry owner. Given that every player tends to act according to their own self-interest for profit maximization, this is thus a non-cooperative game study. The case study in this paper is modelled on two industry players, two oil mills and two plantations. Nash equilibrium is achieved through analysing the best strategy. The strategy selected by the player will lead to the most favorable and positive outcome regardless of whatever decision made by the opponents. In other word, by analysing this scenario using game theory approach, an optimal non-cooperative strategy can be determined. For the future works, it can be applied into the decision support framework for the biomass industry management team. "

The defender must allocate resources amongst possible countermeasures and across possible targets. The attacker then chooses a type of threat and a target to attack. This paper proposes a model for determining optimal resource allocation by combining game theory with a simple multi-attribute utility model. Given a set of possible attributes representing goals or preferences, we allow each player to choose a weight for each attribute, where the subset of attributes with nonzero weights represents that player’s preferences. Every countermeasure is given a score for its effectiveness at both mitigating the effects of an attack in terms of each attribute and reducing the probability of the success of an attack. Furthermore, the consequences of each possible attack are scored in terms of each attribute. The multi-attribute utility aspect of this model uses these scores, along with the players’ weights, to form the basis of the utility (or disutility) for each player. We find that (i) the zero-sum game where the attacker’s and defender’s weights are identical results in the worst losses for the defender, (ii) in general cases the defender’s equilibrium strategy has the result of making the attacker indifferent between multiple attacks and (iii) the use of target-independent countermeasures (i.e. countermeasures which operate at national levels as opposed to operating at differing levels for each target) can increase the cost-effectiveness of countermeasures.

In this game, the players are the government and the susceptible newborns. In order to maximize their own payoffs, the government attempts to reduce the costs for combating the epidemic, and the newborns may be vaccinated only when infective individuals are found in their neighborhoods and/or the government promotes an immunization program. As a consequence of these strategies supported by cost-benefit analysis and perceived risk, numerical simulations show that the disease is not fully eliminated and the government implements quasi-periodic vaccination campaigns.

This paper sets out to systematically investigate the most fundamental assumption in these models: in what kind of situations do the interactions take place? What strategic structures – games – support the evolution of an ingroup bias? More specifically, the aim here is to find the prerequisites for when a bias also with respect to minimal groups – arbitrarily defined groups void of group-specific qualities – is selected for, and which cannot be ascribed to kin selection. Through analyses and simulations of minimal models of two-person games, this paper indicates that only some games are conducive to the evolution of ingroup favouritism. In particular, this class does not contain the prisoners׳ dilemma, but it does contain anti-co-ordination and co-ordination games. Contrasting to the prisoners׳ dilemma, these are games where it is not a matter of whether to behave altruistically, but rather one of predicting what the other person will be doing, and where I would benefit from you knowing my intentions. In anti-co-ordination games, on average, not only will agents discriminate between groups, but also in such a way that their choices maximise the sum of the available payoffs towards the ingroup more often than towards the outgroup. And in co-ordination games, even if agents do manage to co-ordinate with the whole population, they are more likely to co-ordinate on the socially optimal equilibrium within their group. Simulations show that this occurs most often in games where there is a component of risk-taking, and thus trust, involved. A typical such game is the stag hunt or assurance game. "

Each species usually adopts a certain parental care pattern: female-care only, male-care only, biparental care, or even no parental care at all. The differences in care patterns are usually explained by the different costs and benefits arising from caring for the offspring in each animal species. This paper proposes a game-theoretical model to the parental investment conflict based on the parental behavior of St. Peter's fish. St. Peter's fish exhibit different parental care patterns, allowing the examination of the factors which determine the particular behavior in each mating. We present a continuous time, two-stage, asymmetric game, with two types of players: male and female. According to the model's results, three parental care patterns: male-only care, female-only care and biparental care, are possible evolutionarily stable strategies. The evolutionarily stable parental care pattern in a certain mating depends on a parent's increase in mortality due to parental care, and on its advantage from biparental care. These results may explain the different parental care patterns observed in a variety of animal species, including those found in the St. Peter's fish. "

The former players only consider their neighbor’s payoff and updating strategy by classical Fermi rule, while the latter players take both the neighbors’ surrounding information and payoff into account. The results show that the neighbors surrounding information consideration contributes to the evolution of cooperation and finds the fraction of cooperation grows evidently with the increase of advanced players numbers. Our model may provide a pragmatic approach to the research of cooperation in social network. "

The relationships of closeness among the players should modify the bargaining among them and therefore their payoffs. The first models that have studied this closeness used a priori unions or undirected graphs. In the a priori union model a partition of the big coalition is supposed. Each element of the partition represents a group of players with the same interests. The groups negotiate among them to form the grand coalition and later, inside each one, players bargain among them. Now we propose to use proximity relations to represent leveled closeness of the interests among the players and extending the a priori unions model. "

Despite the fact that players are assumed to be unsophisticated, and follow simple adaptive rules, we observe steady states with widespread lending. The game also has steady states with no borrowing or lending, and these can persist in the long run. Using a mix of analytical and computational methods, we identify stable outcomes and provide an explanation for our results.

Results indicate that it is beneficial to be persistent and stubborn, i.e., slow in adapting aspirations and switching actions in response to major dissatisfaction.

The objective in a crossing is to minimize the queuing delay and the problem for a signal controller is to find an optimal signal timing strategy, i.e. establishing green timing for each signal phase. Signal controllers are considered the players of the game. Each intersection aims at finding the green time that minimizes its signal and queuing delay. The problem presents natural restrictions: (a) the number of entering cars and exiting cars is different for each street of the intersection and (b) the interval of time given for vehicles to the green light is equal to the red light in the respective opposite direction . The first restriction determines a leader–follower Stackelberg game model: streets having more traffic require more green time. The last restriction establishes a simultaneous-solution of the game as a better consideration of the real situation. Then, to take advantage of the structure of the game, the paper shows that the solution is given by a Nash equilibrium. We introduce the c-variable method for finding the optimal signal timing distribution and making the problem computationally tractable. The extraproximal method is a two-step iterated procedure: (a) the first step calculates a preliminary approximation to the equilibrium point, and (b) the second step is designed to find an adjustment of the previous step. The formulation of the game is given in terms of coupled nonlinear programming problems implementing the Lagrange principle. Tikhonov׳s regularization method is employed to ensure the convergence of the costfunctions to a Nash equilibrium point. In addition, the extraproximal method is developed in terms of Markov chains. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated by a three-way intersection example. The contributions have major implications for real-world applications. "

The question arises if this assumption is a substantial restriction. In this paper, we adopt the more plausible assumption that only the realizations of past mixed actions are observable, and find that the set of equilibrium payoffs shrinks, compared to that when mixed disagreement actions are observable. We precisely identify the effects of the unobservability and characterize the limiting set of equilibrium payoffs as the two players become sufficiently patient. "

We study how prices, green levels and expected profits are influenced by channel leadership and governmental interventions. Green level sensitivity and fuzzy degree of parameters are considered. Analytical results indicate that manufacturer Stackelberg scenario is the inferior structure than other scenarios and retailer Stackelberg scenario is superior to other scenarios for all players under the strong governmental interventions. Then, when governmental interventions increase, the green level will increase, but the tendency of retail price depends on channel leadership. Governmental interventions are not always beneficial to the green supply chain and the manufacturer. Further, although the government's subsidy is offered to the manufacturer, the retailer benefits from it ultimately and further becomes the main puller of the development of green products. In addition, a relatively high green level floor for subsidy results in the manufacturer's first-mover disadvantage. "

A non-cooperative game is proposed to form the scheduling set in the contention-based multiple-access scenario. In the game, each player only has its delay knowledge and makes decision without the information of other competing players. The payoff function is designed to encourage players to give the transmission chance to the player with urgent packets. Simulation results demonstrate that the game-theoretic scheduling approach can improve the real-time performance compared with the existing scheduling algorithms under different scenarios. "

Johnson, Wendel, and Hamilton (1998) suggested that heavy-drinking players may correspond to Cloninger's (Cloninger, 1987) Type \{II\} alcoholic and that heavy-drinking nonplayers resemble Type I. The current study predicted that (a) sensation seeking would be associated with greater frequency of play and greater frequency of negative consequences from play and that (b) heavy-drinking students who play drinking games would be higher in sensation seeking than heavy-drinking students who do not play. A sample of 172 female and 84 male college students completed the Sensation Seeking Scale Form V, questions about quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption, and questions regarding drinking game participation. Higher levels of sensation seeking predicted greater frequency of play even after controlling for overall quantity and frequency of consumption. Sensation seeking was also related to specific motives for play. Men who were higher in sensation seeking experienced more negative alcohol-related consequences as a result of play. In women, but not in men, heavy-drinking players were higher in sensation seeking than heavy-nondrinking nonplayers. The results of the current study do not clearly support Cloninger's model, but they are consistent with other research concerning the role of sensation seeking and risk taking in contributing to negative alcohol-related consequences. Personality style likely interacts with social norms and contextual factors in influencing drinking game participation and consequences of play. "

We model a situation where a decision-making agent can be represented by more than one player by a game with coalition structure where, besides the game, there is a partition of the player set into several unions. But, whereas usually the decision-making agents are the players in such a game, in this paper the decision-making agents are modeled as the unions in the coalition structure. Consequently, where usually a solution assigns payoffs to the individual players, we introduce the concept of union value being solutions that assign payoffs to the unions in a game with coalition structure. We introduce two such union values, both generalizing the Shapley value for TU-games. The first is the union-Shapley value and considers the unions in the most unified way: when a union enters a coalition then it enters with all its players. The second is the player-Shapley value which takes all players as units, and the payoff of a union is the sum of the payoffs over all its players. We provide axiomatic characterizations of these two union values differing only in a collusion neutrality axiom. After that we apply them to airport games and voting games. "

To effectively address this issue, we develop a decision-making procedure, that facilitates the distribution of disputed areas of specific size among heterogeneous players in a transparent and ethical way, while considering coalitional formations through coexistence. To do this, we model players' alternative strategies and payoffs within a cooperative game-theoretic framework. Depending on whether transferable utility (TU) or non-transferable utility (NTU) is the more appropriate assumption, we illustrate the use of the \{TU\} Shapley value and the Lejano's fixed point \{NTU\} Shapley value to solve for the ideal allocations. The applicability and effectiveness of the process has been tested in a case study area, the Dogger Bank Special Area of Conservation in the North Sea, which involves three totally or partially conflicting activities, i.e. fishing, nature conservation and wind farm development. The findings demonstrate that the process is capable of providing a unique, fair and equitable division of space Finally, among the two solution concepts proposed the fixed point \{NTU\} Shapley value manages to better address the heterogeneity of the players and thus to provide a more socially acceptable allocation that favours the weaker player, while demonstrating the importance of the monetary valuation attributed by each use to the area.

The player must answer a series of multiple-choice questions posed in natural language by selecting the correct answer among four different choices. The architecture of the virtual player consists of 1) a Question Answering (QA) module, which leverages Wikipedia and \{DBpedia\} datasources to retrieve the most relevant passages of text useful to identify the correct answer to a question, 2) an Answer Scoring (AS) module, which assigns a score to each candidate answer according to different criteria based on the passages of text retrieved by the Question Answering module, and 3) a Decision Making (DM) module, which chooses the strategy for playing the game according to specific rules as well as to the scores assigned to the candidate answers. We have evaluated both the accuracy of the virtual player to correctly answer to questions of the game, and its ability to play real games in order to earn money. The experiments have been carried out on questions coming from the official Italian and English boardgames. The average accuracy of the virtual player for Italian is 79.64 % , which is significantly better than the performance of human players, which is equal to 51.33 % . The average accuracy of the virtual player for English is 76.41 % . The comparison with human players is not carried out for English since, playing successfully the game heavily depends on the players' knowledge about popular culture, and in this experiment we have only involved a sample of Italian players. As regards the ability to play real games, which involves the definition of a proper strategy for the usage of lifelines in order to decide whether to answer to a question even in a condition of uncertainty or to retire from the game by taking the earned money, the virtual player earns € 114,531 on average for Italian, and € 88,878 for English, which exceeds the average amount earned by the human players to a greater extent (€ 5926 for Italian).

By introducing an additional stage to the lobbying game the full impact of the dispute process can be reckoned.

Among other things, there may be social gains to forcing the developer to move last in planning disputes. "

The User Equipments (UEs) are sources of data to be uploaded to a cellular base station (eNodeB) and are assumed to be rational self-interested players as they aim at maximizing their own utility. To this aim, the \{UEs\} cooperate to opportunistically implement proximity-based data exchanges where the presence of malicious nodes in the network is a constant threat for the successful cooperation. To cope with this issue, reliability and reputation notions are considered to model the level of trust among the players. Taking inspiration from the recent Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm, social-awareness of the devices is spotted as a key parameter to effectively define the wished trustworthiness. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is validated through a simulative analysis showing a relevant reduction in the data loss due to malicious behavior of a subset of the devices. In particular, up to 86% reduction in terms of data loss is obtained with respect to the case where the proposed trust model is not implemented. Moreover, the trust-based and social-aware solution also guarantees higher gains in terms of the uploading time for the devices taking part of the cooperative D2D-based content uploading. "

Hence, a problem of equilibrium selection arises and the long run outcome strongly depends on the choice of the players’ initial beliefs. We analyze the basins of attraction and their qualitative changes as the model parameters vary. We illustrate that the basins might be nonconnected sets and reveal the mechanism which is responsible for this often-neglected kind of complexity. The analysis of the global bifurcations which cause qualitative changes in the topological structure of the basins is carried out by the method of critical curves. "

A key feature of these rules is that subjects search differently depending on whether their payoffs increase, stay constant or decrease. This paper analyzes learning behavior in a laboratory setting and finds strong confirmation for these asymmetric search behaviors in the context of voluntary contribution games. By varying the amount of information we show that these behaviors are also present even when subjects have full information about the game. "

Due to the differences in terms of data availability and modeling techniques, subjective demand models held by various Gencos are heterogeneous and normally deviate from the real market model as well. The picture of a real electricity market game in Genco’s eye is ‘playing is believing’. Therefore, a question naturally comes to the table: how those \{SDFs\} with the heterogeneous manner impact individual player’s decision and game results. To answer this question, this paper relaxes a conventional assumption, commonly used in the classical oligopolistic equilibrium model, that one correct and uniform demand knowledge is shared by all Gencos. The results suggest that the system equilibriums would be influenced by the Gencos’ knowledge about market demand. The economic value of demand information is assessed regarding the system performances. "

During the course of repeated actions a dynamic process evolves such that the players adapt the amount of investment and the direction of its allocation according to their action preferences. For stability of the interaction matrix the players can form stable coalitions. Cooperation and negotiation on the amount and the allocation of investment could lead to more sustainable use of natural resources. The dynamic coalition-formation process corresponds to a self-organized transition from unilateral action (Nash equilibria) to multilateral cooperation (Pareto optima). With increasing number of players the complexity–stability tradeoff limits the stable coalition size. As an example for resource conflicts the exploitation of fish resources is simulated, for different fish populations and different players harvesting fish. "

Models for evolutionary games have traditionally assumed that players imitate their successful partners by the comparison of respective payoffs, raising the question of what happens if the game information is not easily available. Focusing on this yet-unsolved case, the motivation behind the work presented here is to establish a novel model for the updating of states in a spatial population, by detouring the required payoffs in previous models and considering much more players’ contact patterns. It can be handy and understandable to employ switching probabilities for determining the microscopic dynamics of strategy evolution. Our results illuminate the conditions under which the steady coexistence of competing strategies is possible. These findings reveal that the evolutionary fate of the coexisting strategies can be calculated analytically, and provide novel hints for the resolution of cooperative dilemmas in a competitive context. We hope that our results have disclosed new explanations about the survival and coexistence of competing strategies in structured populations. "

The most successful players will produce more offspring and that depends directly of the strategy adopted. As individuals die, the newborns parents will be those fittest individuals in a certain spatial region. Four different fitness functions are tested to investigate the influence in the evolution of cooperation. Individuals live in a lattice modeled by probabilistic cellular automata and play the game with some of their neighborhoods. In spite of players homogeneously distributed over the space, a mean-field approximation is presented in terms of ordinary differential equations. "

The main innovation is the group-changing assumption which allows players to ‘vote with their feet.’ In contrast to most of the recent literature (e.g. Kandori et al., 1993) in which the risk-dominant equilibrium is selected in the long run, the model here predicts convergence to the efficient equilibrium if interaction is decentralized enough. Furthermore, it is shown how the model can be applied to the problem of product standardization. "

The objective of this paper is to provide new insights on some dimensions of the bargaining process–asymmetries and uncertainties in particular–by using a non-cooperative game theory approach. We develop a computational model which simulates the process of negotiation among more than two players, who bargain over the sharing of more than one pie. Through numerically simulating several multiple issues negotiation games among multiple players, we identify the main features of players’ optimal strategies and equilibrium agreements. As in most economic situations, uncertainty crucially affects also bargaining processes. Therefore, in our analysis, we introduce uncertainty over the size of the pies to be shared and assess the impact on players’ strategic behaviour. Our results confirm that uncertainty affects players’ behaviour and modify the likelihood of a self-enforcing agreement to emerge. The model proposed here can have several applications, in particular in the field of natural resource and environmental management at the national or local level, where conflicts over how to share a resource of a finite size are increasing.

In the proposed model, players are endowed with a sense of rationality, which helps evaluate behaviors radically and select neighbors with different attractiveness. Those neighbors who made a preferable strategy and got more payoffs compared with the anti-strategy will have more attractiveness as references. It is found that the selection based on radical evaluation significantly enhances the level of cooperation on regular networks with large neighborhood size K and scale-free networks over a wide range of cost-to-benefit ratio r. Discussions for the transition of spatial patterns and strategy degree distribution at some critical values of the payoff parameter show the effects of the proposed selecting mechanism. The findings may be helpful in understanding cooperative behavior in natural and social systems consisting of rational selection with radical evaluation. "

Age and gender are the moderating factors in the model. The research model is empirically assessed based on 3919 validated responses from the users of a social network game in China.

Across two experimental studies, we provide evidence that games played publically (versus privately) are more motivating to players, and also demonstrate the important influence of feedback via building a character or completing a status bar. In study 1, we find that, for public gaming contexts, players experience more enjoyment, effort, and flow when progress is shown via building a character. Furthermore, in study 2 we extend study 1's findings and discover a moderated mediation model for brand attitudes. Specifically, the relationship between public gaming context and brand attitude is mediated by enjoyment and flow. Further, the mediation of enjoyment and flow is moderated by feedback type, where progress affects brand attitude when a character is used for game feedback, but not for status bar feedback. We examine our research questions within the context of intrinsic motivation, specifically self-determination theory. "

Each player can choose one of the following strategies: “always defect” (ALLD), “tit-for-tat” (TFT), and “always cooperate” (ALLC). Players merely interact with four immediate neighbors at first and adjust strategies according to their rewards. First, the evolutionary dynamics of the three strategies in non-spatial population is investigated, and the results indicate that cooperation is not favored in most settings without spatial structure. Next, an analytical method, which is based on comparing the local payoff structures, is introduced for the spatial game model. Using the conditions derived from the method as criteria, the parameter plane for two major parameters of the spatial game model is divided and nine representative regions are identified. In each parameter region, a distinct spatiotemporal dynamics is characterized. The spatiotemporal dynamics not only verify that the spatial structure promote the evolution of cooperation but also reveal how cooperation is favored. Our results show that spatial structure is the keystone of the evolution of intraspecific diversity. "

To support hundreds of thousands of concurrent players, game providers have so far focused on developing highly scalable game server architectures and extensible network infrastructures. Recently, distributed online games are beginning to incorporate more interactive features and action sequences; thus, it becomes increasingly important to provision server resources in an efficient manner to support real-time interaction between the users. In this paper, we present a novel distributed algorithm to select game servers for a group of clients participating in a large scale interactive online game session. The goal of server selection is to minimize the server resource usage while satisfying a real-time delay constraint. We develop a synchronization delay model for interactive games and formulate the server selection problem, and prove that the considered problem is NP-hard. The proposed algorithm, called zoom-in–zoom-out, is adaptive to session dynamics (e.g., clients join) and lets the clients select appropriate servers in a distributed manner such that the server resource is efficiently utilized. Using simulation, we study the performance of the proposed algorithm and show that it is simple, yet effective in achieving its design goal. In particular, we show that the performance of our algorithm is comparable to, or sometimes even better than, that of centralized greedy algorithms, which require global information and extensive computations.

The super efficiency model was developed to rank efficient \{DMUs\} based a new efficient frontier comprised by all other DMUs. This may lead to a multi-platform problem that different efficient \{DMUs\} are evaluated based on different efficient frontiers and the resulted super efficiencies of efficient \{DMUs\} are not comparable. This paper addresses the multi-platform problem from the perspective of a cooperative game. Efficient \{DMUs\} are regarded as players and subsets of these efficient \{DMUs\} as coalitions. The effect of a coalition on a specific efficient \{DMU\} is defined as the DMU's efficiency change proportion (ECP) based on the traditional \{DEA\} models when the coalition is removed from the reference set. Basing on the ECP, we define a characteristic function as the sum of all efficient DMUs’ ECPs, and prove that this function is super-additive. Then, the Shapley value is introduced as a solution of this cooperative game and applied to rank efficient DMUs. The proposed approach is demonstrated by two numerical examples. Finally, we extend the proposed approach in this paper to the \{VRS\} assumption. "

For the symmetric case of identical players a complete analytical study of the stability conditions for the fixed points, which are Nash equilibria of the game, is given. For the situation of several coexisting stable Nash equilibria a numerical study of their basins of attraction is provided. This gives, evidence of the occurrence of global bifurcations at which the basins are transformed from simply connected sets into non-connected sets, a basin structure which is peculiar of non-invertible maps. The presence of several coexisting attractors (or multistability) is observed even when complex attractors exist. Two different routes to complexity are presented: one related to the creation of more and more complex attractors; the other related to the creation of more and more complex structures of the basins. Starting from the benchmark case of identical players, the effects of heterogeneous behavior of the players, causing the loss of the symmetry properties of the dynamical system, are investigated through numerical explorations.

During the strategy update, the individual reputation is commonly determined by two corresponding partners on interdependent lattices, where the imitated neighbors are chosen in accordance with the average, maximum and minimum of reputation values between two partners within the neighborhood of a focal player. A large plethora of simulations indicate that three reputation computing rules all lead to the promotion of cooperation when compared to the traditional public goods game model. Among them, the promotion of cooperation under the average and minimum schemes are relatively better than that produced by the maximum rule. The detailed cluster formation and reputation distribution are provided to illustrate the slight difference between the outcomes under these three decision making criterions, in which the choice of learning objects is governed by their reputations. Thus, we can conclude that current results are further conducive to understanding the universal and persuasive cooperation within many natural, biological, social and even man-made systems. "

When the stock price process is governed by a Markovian regime-switching GBM, the pricing measures chosen by the two approaches coincide.

With respect to this group of random orders, and again using the extended consistency theorem, a formula for the unique random order value operator, proposed by Raut, (Indian Statistical Institute discussion paper no. 8108, 1981) and Raut (Random order approach to Shapley-value of games and Haar measure (mimeo), 1993, University of California-San Diego), is derived for economically important classes of scalar and vector measure valued games in pNA.

This is because, in practice, there is a real risk of raw material supply being interrupted. Given that the various participating entities are often unable to accurately estimate either their own revenue stream or costs, or the actions of other stakeholders, this paper builds an evolutionary game to model three parties including the government, biofuel enterprises and restaurants under the assumptions of incomplete information and bounded entity rationality, and investigates supply chain policy options. Results indicate that the strategy choices of the various parties (dominance, treatment and participation) are merely in equilibrium for the time being. In the long run, however, there will be one of two equilibrium states: either all three players withdraw from supply chain operation or biofuel enterprises and restaurants eventually take an active part in reverse supply chain management without government intervention. To attain this long-term goal, governments should eliminate the garbage disposal fees levied on restaurants, while, at the same time, increase quantity-based subsidies to biofuel enterprises. Cracking down on restaurants that privately sell waste cooking oil to illegal peddlers should be regarded as a long-term task. Therefore, in either equilibrium state, restaurants should always be the focus of attention. "

Optimization provides only the illusion of control, when low-entropy strategies (i.e., which use more information) under-perform random strategies (with maximal entropy). This illusion is unfortunately widespread in many human attempts to manage or predict complex systems. For the PG, the illusion is especially striking in that the optimization rule reverses an already paradoxical-seeming positive gain—the Parrondo effect proper—and turns it negative. While this phenomenon has been previously demonstrated using somewhat artificial conditions in the \{MPPG\} [L. Dinis, J.M.R. Parrondo, Europhys. Lett. 63 (2003) 319; J.M.R. Parrondo, L. Dinis, J.

Through a game theoretic approach we show how product greening levels, prices and profits are influenced by cost sharing contract within the supply chains. We study two models of cost sharing – one in which the retailer offers a cost sharing contract and the other in which the retailer and manufacturer bargain on the cost sharing contract. We also study the impact of greening costs and consumer sensitivity towards green products. Our key contribution lies in modelling cost sharing contract and analysing its impact on a green supply chain. Our study contributes to the burgeoning field of green supply chains and collaboration between channel partners. "

In the first stage, the three terminals have to decide on whether to act as a singleton or to enter into a coalition with one or both of the other terminals. The decision at this stage should presumably be based on the predicted outcome for the second stage. The second stage is here modelled as a Bertrand game with one outside competitor, the coalition and the terminal in Karachi Port (if any) that has not joined the coalition. Furthermore, three partial and one grand coalition among the three terminals at Karachi Port are investigated. The concepts of “characteristic function” and “core” are used to analyse the stability of these coalitions and this revealed that one combination does not satisfy the superadditivity property of the characteristic function and can therefore be ruled out. The resulting payoffs (profits) of these coalitions are analysed on the basis of “core”. The best payoff for all players is in the case of a “grand coalition”. However, the real winner is the outsider (the terminal at the second port) which earns a better payoff without joining the coalition, and hence will play the role of the “orthogonal free-rider”. "

Recently there has been much interest in studying the outcome of games in which players may choose a strategy from the continuous interval between extremes, requiring the set of two possible choices be replaced by a single continuous equation. This has led to confusion and even errors in the classification of the game being played. The issue is described here specifically in relation to the continuous prisoners dilemma and the continuous snowdrift game. A case study is then presented demonstrating the misclassification that can result from the extension of discrete games into continuous space. The paper ends with a call for a more rigorous and clear framework for working with continuous games. "

Evolutionary game theory, on the other hand, studies frequency dependent strategy interactions, but usually omits life history and the demographic structure of the population. Here we show how an integration of both aspects can substantially alter the underlying evolutionary dynamics. We study the replicator dynamics of strategy interactions in life stage structured populations. Individuals have two basic strategic behaviours, interacting in pairwise games. A player may condition behaviour on the life stage of its own, or that of the opponent, or the matching of life stages between both players. A strategy is thus defined as the set of rules that determines a player׳s life stage dependent behaviours. We show that the diversity of life stage structures and life stage dependent strategies can promote each other, and the stable frequency of basic strategic behaviours can deviate from game equilibrium in populations with life stage structures.

In massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, customization options are limited and in multiplayer games like Battlefield, there are no ways of customizing the appearance of the players’ avatar. This lack of ability to visually distinguish oneself means that names become important in online games, and assists with building understanding of the people that play these games, which is notably important for games operating via Free-to-Play revenue models. Here, a large-scale, cross-game analysis of names and behaviors in games is presented, based on datasets spanning over eight million character names and 80,000 gamer tags with associated behavioral data, from four major commercial game titles: the role-playing game World of Warcraft and the tactical shooters Battlefield 2 Bad Company 2, Crysis and Medal of Honor. The results highlight the inventiveness of the names players adopt for their characters or accounts, and describe two different patterns – or communities – of name usage: in World of Warcraft, player character names are distributed according to power laws, have semantic meaning (no numbers permitted in names), and name selection is related to the aesthetics and game function of characters, with some names even being predictors of particular classes and races. In the tactical shooters, where all gamer tags are unique, names comparatively more rarely have a clear semantic meaning (numbers and special characters are permitted and often used), and name components are not distributed according to power laws. However, there is to a degree of a non-random relationship between gamer tag and in-game behavior. These results indicate that the name chosen by players for their characters or tags can potentially be useful for player profiling purposes in online games. "

In this paper, we propose an improved public goods game model with reputation effect on spatial lattices to investigate the evolution of cooperation regarding the allocation of public resources. In our model, we modify the individual utility or fitness as a product of the present payoff and reputation-related power function, and strategy update adopts a Fermi-like probability function during the game evolution. Meanwhile, for an interaction between a pair of partners, the reputation of a cooperative agent will be accrued beyond two units, but the defective player will decrease his reputation by one unit. Extensive Monte Carlo numerical simulations indicate the introduction of reputation will foster the formation of cooperative clusters, and greatly enhance the level of public cooperation on the spatial lattices. The larger reputation factor leads to the higher cooperation level since the reputation effect will be enormously embedded into the utility evaluation under this scenario. The current results are vastly beneficial to understand the persistence and emergence of cooperation among many natural, social and synthetic systems, and also provide some useful suggestions to devise the feasible social governance measures and modes for the public resources or affairs.

abstract = "Abstract The objective of this paper is to develop a new solution methodology for matrix games, in which goals are viewed as intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and the elements of the pay-off matrix are represented by triangular intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (TIFNs). In this methodology, a suitable ranking function is defined to establish an order relation between two TIFNs, and the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy (I-fuzzy) inequalities is interpreted. Utilizing these inequality relations and ranking functions, a pair of linear programming models is derived from a pair of auxiliary intuitionistic fuzzy programming models. Based on the aspiration levels, this pair of linear programming models is solved to determine the optimal strategies for both players of the game. The proposed method in this paper is illustrated with a voting share problem to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method. "

Here, we study communicative sensorimotor behavior of humans in a two-person joint motor task where each player controls one dimension of a planar motion. We designed this joint task as a game where one player (the sender) possesses private information about a hidden target the other player (the receiver) wants to know about, and where the sender’s actions are costly signals that influence the receiver’s control strategy. We developed a game-theoretic model within the framework of signaling games to investigate whether subjects’ behavior could be adequately described by the corresponding equilibrium solutions. The model predicts both separating and pooling equilibria, in which signaling does and does not occur respectively. We observed both kinds of equilibria in subjects and found that, in line with model predictions, the propensity of signaling decreased with increasing signaling costs and decreasing uncertainty on the part of the receiver. Our study demonstrates that signaling games, which have previously been applied to economic decision-making and animal communication, provide a framework for human signaling behavior arising during sensorimotor interactions in continuous and dynamic environments.

We study a sequence of games in which the stochastic kernel that links the state variable is unknown. Successive stage games are played by successive generations of identical players. Each generation makes a rational forecast of the state, given their belief about the true kernel and the equilibrium implemented by the players. Beliefs are updated by Bayes' rule after observing the actual state. Our present results concern the dynamic behavior of the forecasts process. We show there is partial learning in the sense of being able to (asymptotically) predict the future as well as an omniscient modeler who knows the true transition structure and understands the stochastic evolution of the state and players' actions. Moreover, we characterize the limiting behavior of the forecasts process in terms of the set of full information rational expectations forecasts. "

The problem is formulated on an unreliable network such that edges are subject to fail independently, and attacks increase the probability of failure for the attacked network edges. The reliability is measured by the critical service rate, which equals the probability that at least a fraction α of the nodes in the network are connected to a server. We model this problem as a bi-level optimization problem, with the network designer acting as the leader and the attacker acting as the follower. The problem is very difficult to solve, both because of its bi-level structure and because simply evaluating the critical service rate for a single network configuration and attack is NP-hard. We propose a novel Game-Theoretic Genetic Algorithm (GTGA) that simultaneously maintains two populations, one for each player, which interact through a joint payoff matrix. We benchmark the \{GTGA\} against a more straightforward Nested \{GA\} (NGA) and find that the \{GTGA\} significantly outperforms the \{NGA\} in terms of solution quality with nearly identical \{CPU\} times. We also introduce an efficient simulation method to estimate the reliability for a given set of servers and integrate this into the GAs. We contribute to the literature on the reliable server assignment problem, as well as introducing a novel algorithmic approach that can be adapted to other bi-level optimization problems. "

An \{NPD\} model captures the essential factors for the evolution of altruism directly in its parameters and integrates important aspects of these two theories such as Hamilton's rule, Simpson's paradox, and the Price covariance equation. The model also suggests a simple interpretation of the Price selection decomposition and an alternative decomposition that is symmetrical and complementary to it. In some situations this alternative shows the temporal changes in within- and between-group selection more clearly than the Price equation. In addition, we provide a new perspective on strong vs. weak altruism by identifying their different underlying game structures (based on absolute fitness) and showing how their evolutionary dynamics are nevertheless similar under selection (based on relative fitness). In contrast to conventional wisdom, the model shows that both strong and weak altruism can evolve in periodically formed random groups of non-conditional strategies if groups are multigenerational. An integrative approach based on the \{NPD\} helps unify different perspectives on the evolution of altruism. "

For the cases of nonquadratic criteria, we develop a numeric solution scheme for the Nash feedback equilibrium. This scheme is an application of a discrete time, discrete state controlled Markov chain approximation method originally developed for solving deterministic and stochastic dynamic optimization problems. In our Nash–Cournot equilibrium, the degree of concentration in supply declines over time whereas the previous models with physical depletion and open-loop equilibrium concepts predict that a Nash–Cournot resource market will develop in the direction of monopoly supply.

Game data were used to probe various aspects of Bandura's (1986) \{SR\} learning model and related effects on game flow state as described in Csikszentmihalyi's (1990) flow theory to determine if game information can be used to measure \{SR\} during different flow states. A tool for recording stage selection, hit rate, and other real time data was created to monitor and measure flow state among players immersed in interactive play. Self-reaction capabilities were measured in terms of skill- and game-level difficulty during different states. Results indicate that \{SR\} exerted a significant and positive effect on flow state. Our main conclusions are (a) flow state was continuously influenced by self-reaction over time; (b) hit rate served as an indicator of self-judgment in terms of challenge, skill and flow state; and (c) flow states in players with distinct self-reaction capabilities were influenced by play stage selection. It is our hope that the method used in this study will help researchers in their efforts to measure and/or analyze player sense of fun in game-based learning environments. "

The interactions between the utility company (leader) and users (followers) are formulated into a 1-leader, N-follower Stackelberg game, where optimization problems are formed for each player to help select the optimal strategy. A pricing function is adopted for regulating real-time prices (RTP), which then act as a coordinator, inducing users to join the game. An iterative algorithm is proposed to derive the Stackelberg equilibrium, through which optimal power generation and power demands are determined for the utility company and users respectively. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method can efficiently reshape users’ demands, including flattening peak demands and filling the vacancy of valley demands, and significantly reduce the mismatch between supply and demand.

The rules of the game refer to the simple procedure of fair division among two players, known as the “I cut, you choose” mechanism which has been widely discussed in the literature. In this game one of the players has to make intransitive choices in order to achieve the optimal result (for him/her and his/her co-player). The point is that an intransitive choice can be rational. Previously, an increase in the significance of intransitive strategies was achieved by referring to models of quantum games. We show that relevant intransitive strategies also appear in the classic description of decision algorithms. "

Various assumptions can be made about how a permission structure affects the cooperation possibilities. In the conjunctive approach it is assumed that each player needs permission from all his superiors. This paper deals with fuzzy permission structures in the conjunctive approach. In this model, players could depend partially on other players, that is, they may have certain degree of autonomy. First, we define a value for games with fuzzy permission structure that only takes into account the direct relations among players and provide a characterization for this value. Finally, we study a value for games with fuzzy permission structure which takes account of the indirect relations among players. "

There are a finite number of players who repeatedly update from a finite number of available languages/signaling strategies. Players imitate the most fit agents with high probability or mutate with low probability. We analyze the long-run distribution of states and show that, for sufficiently small mutation probability, its support is limited to efficient communication systems. We find that this behavior is insensitive to the particular choice of evolutionary dynamic, a property that is due to the game having a potential structure with a potential function corresponding to average fitness. Consequently, the model supports conclusions similar to those found in the literature on language competition. That is, we show that efficient languages eventually predominate the society while reproducing the empirical phenomenon of linguistic drift. The emergence of efficiency in the atomic case can be contrasted with results for non-atomic signaling games that establish the non-negligible possibility of convergence, under replicator dynamics, to states of unbounded efficiency loss.

This paper shows also how transmission constraints can play a direct role in the outcome of the oligopolistic competition and encourage strategic behavior by the generators. Transmission lines that would not be constrained if the players did not know of their thermal limits may be strategically driven to operate at these limits in order to maximize the profits of the players who have market power, leaving the others to cope with the consequences of such behavior.

In the model, it is assumed that the (representative) consumer is a player of the game choosing quantities purchased from price-setting oligopolists; in this context, production and purchase decisions are distinguished. The sequentiality of these decisions is given by two management rules. When a \{CREPE\} exists, it coincides with Bertrand equilibrium but the existence depends on the type of management rule to be used; the existence of a \{REVE\} is proved in situations where there is no Bertrand equilibrium.

Specifically, it asks: what do different notions of rationality and different assumptions about what players believe about…what others believe about the rationality of players imply regarding play in a game? Being explicit about these assumptions can be important, because solution concepts are often motivated intuitively in terms of players’ beliefs and their rationality; however, the epistemic analysis may show limitations in these intuitions, reveal what additional assumptions are hidden in the informal arguments, clarify the concepts or show how the intuitions can be generalized. A further premise of this chapter is that the primitives of the model— namely, the hierarchies of beliefs—should be elicitable, at least in principle. Building upon explicit assumptions about elicitable primitives, we present classical and recent developments in epistemic game theory and provide characterizations of a nonexhaustive, but wide, range of solution concepts.

In our first model, cooperation consists of the production of a public good, and adversity is linked to the degree of complementarity of the players׳ efforts in producing the public good. In our second model, cooperation consists of the defense of a public, and/or a private good with by-product benefits, and adversity is measured by the number of random attacks (e.g., by a predator) facing the players. In both of these models, our analysis confirms the existence of the so-called boomerang effect, which states that in a harsh environment, the individual player has few incentives to unilaterally defect in a situation of joint cooperation. Focusing on such an effect in isolation leads to the “common-enemy” hypothesis that a larger degree of adversity increases the probability of cooperation. Yet, we also find that a sucker effect may simultaneously exist, which says that in a harsh environment, the individual player has few incentives to unilaterally cooperate in a situation of joint defection. Looked at in isolation, the sucker effect leads to the competing hypothesis that a larger degree of adversity decreases the probability of cooperation. Our analysis predicts circumstances in which the “common enemy” hypothesis prevails, and circumstances in which the competing hypothesis prevails. "

This paper introduces immigration of illegal unskilled workers into a simple model of an open economy with heterogeneous labor and, within this context, examines its macroeconomic and welfare consequences. The analysis shows that when skilled native wage setters and the policymakers behave as Nash players, \{ILM\} improves the position of the entire native labor force, i.e. both skilled and unskilled workers. Moreover, it reduces the inflationary bias associated with expansionary policies and thus has a positive overall impact on ‘social welfare’ in the economy. This result contrasts with several earlier studies that suggest that illegal immigration causes the position of at least some members of an economy to worsen. It also provides one possible macroeconomic explanation as to why illegal immigrants are currently tolerated in ‘inflation prone’ countries despite the fact that their presence sometimes causes social tensions. On the other hand, when native skilled workers and the policymakers behave cooperatively, \{ILM\} may in fact make the entire native workforce worse off. This result suggests that countries with ‘aggressive’ unions in skilled labor markets stand to gain from illegal immigration while countries with ‘soft’ unions may lose. Finally, it is shown that domestic labor market conditions determine the ‘optimum’ degree of government intervention in the illegal migrant labor market. "

They are characterized by the way in which their environment, the players' objectives and the order of play are modeled. Repeated games iterate over a static game any number (possibly infinite) of times, in which the players aim to optimize their average utility. In this context, a Nash equilibrium becomes a profile of action plans. Folk theorems aim to characterize the utilities of repeated games. Stochastic games are a more general case of repeated games, in which the game can evolve over time. In this case, the stage utility of a player will depend on his actions and also on the current state of the game. This situation is encountered in wireless applications; e.g., if the battery level of a terminal changes. Difference games may have a state that has more than one component, and a more general evolution law and observation structure. Discrete-time dynamic games have a finite number of stages. Their Nash equilibria can be derived, but in general the area still contains many open problems. Evolutionary games have players that interact strategically, but may not always be rational. Concepts such as the evolutionarily stable state, unbeatable or evolutionarily stable strategies, and the price of anarchy are used. "

One of the first models where restrictions in cooperation are considered is the one of games with coalition structure of Aumann and Drèze (1974). They assumed that the player set is partitioned into unions and that players can only cooperate within their own union. Owen (1977) introduced a value for games with coalition structure under the assumption that also the unions can cooperate among them. Winter (1989) extended this value to games with levels structure of cooperation, which consists of a game and a finite sequence of partitions defined on the player set, each of them being coarser than the previous one. A share function for TU-games is a type of solution that assigns to every game a vector whose components add up to one, and thus they can be interpreted as players’ shares in the worth to be allocated. Extending the approach to games with coalition structure developed in van den Brink and van der Laan (2005), we introduce a class of share functions for games with levels structure of cooperation by defining, for each player and each level, a standard TU-game. The share given to each player is then defined as the product of her shares in the games at every level. We show several desirable properties and provide axiomatic characterizations of this class of LS-share functions. "

We demonstrate the existence of a descriptively adequate subgame perfect equilibrium under two standard decision-theoretical assumptions. First, players choose under uncertainty in a probabilistic manner as captured by embedding a core deterministic decision theory in a model of probabilistic choice. Second, players adopt non-linear decision weights and overweight the likelihood of rare events as captured, for example, by rank-dependent utility or prospect theory. "

A theory of unpredictable behavior based on differential complexity constraints is presented in the context of repeated two-person zero-sum games. Each player's complexity constraint is represented by an endowed oracle and a strategy is feasible if it can be implemented with an oracle machine using that oracle. When one player's oracle is sufficiently more complex than the other player's, an equilibrium exists with one player fully exploiting the other. If each player has an incompressible sequence (relative to the opponent's oracle) according to Kolmogorov complexity, an equilibrium exists in which equilibrium payoffs are equal to those of the stage game and all equilibrium strategies are unpredictable. A full characterization of history-independent equilibrium strategies is also obtained. "

However, bringing more players into the competitive environment reduces the intention of the commercial partner to engage in the public–private partnership (PPP). "

In the case of identical players the map has a symmetry property that implies the invariance of the diagonal x1=x2, so that synchronized dynamics is possible. The basic question is whether an attractor of the one-dimensional restriction of the map to the diagonal is also an attractor for the two-dimensional map, and in which sense. In this paper, a particular dynamic duopoly game is considered for which the local study of the transverse stability, in a neighborhood of the invariant submanifold in which synchronized dynamics takes place, is combined with a study of the global behavior of the map. When measure theoretic, but not topological, attractors are present on the invariant diagonal, intermittency phenomena are observed. The global behavior of the noninvertible map is investigated by studying of the critical manifolds of the map, by which a two-dimensional region is defined that gives an upper bound to the amplitude of intermittent trajectories. Global bifurcations of the basins of attraction are evidenced through contacts between critical curves and basin boundaries. "

It is then assumed that the “players” (the manufacturer and the retailer) arrive at their pricing and batch-size decisions through a Stackelberg game or a “fixed markup percentage” game. The first part of this paper reveals many implausible effects of demand-curve forms on the behavior of these gaming models. However, we do not merely conclude that two-echelon gaming results obtained via assuming one convenient demand-curve form can often become invalid under other demand-curve forms. More importantly, we argue in the second part of the paper that the various implausible effects revealed here suggest a different but more fundamental conclusion: the assumed non-cooperative games are themselves flawed, because “gaming” is meaningless and logically circular in a deterministic-and-symmetrical-information system. We then present an introductory illustration on how the introduction of stochasticity and information-asymmetry leads to more plausible two-echelon supply-chain gaming models. Together, the two parts demonstrate the necessity and practicality of using a stochastic-and-asymmetric-information instead of the prevalent deterministic-symmetric-information approach in many supply-chain models.

A field survey was conducted to test the hypotheses of the study. Respondents were graduate students from Taiwan universities. A total of 411 undergraduate students with massively multiplayer online gaming (MMOGs) experience participated in this study. The structural equation model (SEM) method was employed to analyze the data. The findings indicate that perceived product trialability has a direct influence on intent to play new games, and indirect effects through perceived process control. Gender differences also moderate the trialability effects on the adoption of new online games. Perceived trialability had more of an effect on intention to play new online games for female players than for male players. To develop an effective product development and communication strategy, the finding suggests that online game firms should focus on new product characteristics and consider consumer gender differences.

Here I analyse the Hawk–Assessor game to examine this issue. In this game, Hawks attack other players when they meet them, beginning a fight. In contrast, Assessors first perform a display and subsequently decide whether to fight. The Assessor strategy is the only evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) in the classic Hawk–Assessor game, which assumes that Hawks do not attack displaying Assessors. In this paper, first I point out that, when that assumption is not made, Hawk is also an ESS. Then, I consider the cost of inappropriate attacks on nonopponents. Animals in the real world encounter not only opponents but also nonopponents, such as partners and potential mates. They might attack nonopponents inappropriately because of uncertainty of social recognition or overly aggressive motivation. Assessors might avoid inappropriate attacks because they start encounters with conspecifics using a display and thereby gain time to verify the social recognition or reduce their aggressive motivation. In this case, the Assessor strategy can be the only \{ESS\} again and the display of Assessors becomes a cross-contextual display. According to this model, one can predict that, for species performing cross-contextual displays, there is a risk of inappropriate attack. One can also predict that the species without risk will start agonistic interactions by attacking immediately. Empirical examples are consistent with the predictions. "

We show the appearance of small diameter equilibrium networks with the threshold of α = 1 / 4 in the hierarchical or tree-based networks. Moreover, the general set of equilibrium networks in our model are guaranteed to exist and they are pairwise Nash stable with transfers [Bloch, F., and M. O.

abstract = "Abstract The Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma (IPD) game has been commonly used to investigate the cooperation among competitors. However, most previous studies on the \{IPD\} focused solely on maximizing players’ average payoffs without considering their risk preferences. By introducing the concept of income stream risk into the \{IPD\} game, this paper presents a novel evolutionary \{IPD\} model with agents seeking to balance between average payoffs and risks with respect to their own risk attitudes. We build a new \{IPD\} model of multiple agents, in which agents interact with one another in the pair-wise \{IPD\} game while adapting their risk attitudes according to their received payoffs. Agents become more risk averse after their payoffs exceed their aspirations, or become more risk seeking after their payoffs fall short of their aspirations. The aspiration levels of agents are determined based on their historical self-payoff information or the payoff information of the agent population. Simulations are conducted to investigate the emergence of cooperation under these two comparison methods. Results indicate that agents can sustain a highly cooperative equilibrium when they consider only their own historical payoffs as aspirations (called historical comparison) in adjusting their risk attitudes. This holds true even for the \{IPD\} with a short game encounter, for which cooperation was previously demonstrated difficult. However, when agents evaluate their payoffs in comparison with the population average payoff (called social comparison), those agents with payoffs below the population average tend to be dissatisfied with the game outcomes. This dissatisfaction will induce more risk-seeking behavior of agents in the \{IPD\} game, which will constitute a strong deterrent to the emergence of mutual cooperation in the population. "

This paper investigates whether or not existing transmission capacities of cross-border interconnectors are sufficient to achieve this result and create vigorous competition in the market. A model with two decision levels is used. On the first level profit maximizing generators play Cournot game against each other. On the last level the system operator clears the market and determines flows in the network to maximize social welfare subject to a set of physical constraints. As each strategic generator anticipates her impact on equilibrium prices and congestion in the system, her optimization problem is subject to equilibrium constraints from the system operator's problem. The analysis demonstrates that interconnector capacities in Western Europe are insufficient for integration alone to reduce the exercise of market power. I compare several possible competition-enhancing policies: expansion of interconnectors and different scenarios of national markets’ restructuring. I show that although increase of line capacity is a useful tool to stimulate competition in an integrated market, it is not a substitute for the restructuring of large players. "

In our stylized model, the architecture of the social media platform ecosystem (to be briefly referred as the ‘value ecosystem’) is composed of user group, \{SP\} (Service Platform) and \{CP\} (Contents Provider). Specifically, users are uniformly populated over [0,Δ], where Δ represents the span of users' preference for the social media services. We also emphasize the differences in the \{SDP\} and resulting service provisioning of the value ecosystems. Accordingly, the roles of players are different in two ecosystems. Multi-stage game models are employed for analyses and comparisons of players' optimal behaviors and the value-creation capability in each value ecosystem. In particular, the latter is measured by the amount of information created in the respective ecosystem. Our first analysis indicates that the user group is segmentized differently across the value ecosystems. Subsequently, following analysis presents equilibrium strategies of \{SP\} and CP. According to our analyses and experiments, it is more likely that the overall level of the social media services in \{LVE\} is higher than that in CVE. However, the total amount of information created throughout \{CVE\} is larger than that in LVE. These findings imply that the leadership of \{SP\} may boost or constrain the value ecosystem. We also demonstrate that the user diversity measured by Δ is another key parameter for value creation in these ecosystems. "

In this paper, the system model is divided to two layers, in which the macro base station and clusters constitute the first layer network; femtocells in cluster make up the second layer network. Because of the different model structures, different game theories are used in different layers. Stackelberg game is used in the first layer, and non-cooperation game is used in the second layer. Meanwhile \{RB\} and power levels stand for the actions that are associated with each player in the game. The problem of resource allocation is formulated as a mixed integer programming problem. In order to minimize the complexity of the proposed algorithm, the resource allocation task is decomposed into two sub problems: a \{RB\} allocation and a power allocation. The result is compared with the traditional methods, the analysis illustrates the proposed algorithm has a better performance regarding \{SINR\} and energy efficiency of the heterogeneous networks. "

This assessment game combines tic-tac-toe with online assessment, and revises the rule of tic-tac-toe for stimulating students to use online formative assessment actively. Finally, an empirical investigation carried out to evaluate the performance of \{FITS\} indicating that considerable gains for the experimental group over the control group. The proposed system extensively enhanced students’ learning interest, attitude and degree of technology acceptance, as well as improved their achievements in problem solving activities.

How would or should the “players” (i.e., the manufacturer and the retailer) set their prices? In contrast to many studies that assume a dominant manufacturer implementing the “manufacturer-Stackelberg” (“[mS]”) game, this paper examines how a dominant retailer should operate when his knowledge of c is imperfect. We first derive optimal decisions (some of them counter-intuitive) for the dominant retailer when he is restricted to choosing between [rS] (retailer-Stackelberg) and [mS]. Second, we propose a “reverse quantity discount” scheme that the dominant retailer (i.e., the downstream player) can offer to the manufacturer (note that the standard discount scheme is offered by the upstream player). We show that this discounting scheme is quite effective compared to the considerably more complicated though nevertheless theoretically optimal “menu of contracts.” We also reveal a largely overlooked function of discounting; i.e., discounting enables an “ignorant” but dominant player to usurp the earnings attributable to the knowledge of the dominated player. Finally, we also show that discounting works well when the demand curve is linear, but becomes ineffective when the demand curve is iso-elastic – a result echoing the conclusions of some earlier related works.

These systems include biological and social systems with constraints on instantaneous information or where environmental responses do not necessarily reflect the true state of the system. Linear stability analysis determines the conditions for persistent oscillations in the players' mixed strategies. Using a parameterized stochastic version of the dilemma, the results indicate that if the environment modifies the payoffs, and thus ‘releases’ the prisoners from their dilemma, the prisoners become prone to instabilities in their strategies given sufficient delays. Again, the prisoners fail to coordinate their actions. "

It was found that level-k models generally perform better than the agent quantal response equilibrium (AQRE) model and its variant with altruistic player types for increasing-pie centipede games, while the \{AQRE\} model with altruistic player types performs better in constant-pie games.

In this paper, we propose a coalition formation game theory-based approach to identify overlapping and hierarchical communities. We model community detection as a coalition formation game in which individuals in a social network are modelled as rational players aiming to improve the group's utilities by cooperating with other players to form coalitions. Each player is allowed to join multiple coalitions, and those coalitions with fewer players can merge into a larger coalition as long as the merge operation is beneficial to the utilities of the merged coalitions, thus overlapping and hierarchical communities can be revealed simultaneously. The utility function of each coalition is defined as the combination of a gain function and a cost function. The gain function measures the degree of interactions amongst the players inside a coalition, while the cost function instead represents the degree of the interactions between the players of the coalition and the rest of the network. As game theory provides a formal analytical framework with a set of mathematical tools to study the complex interactions among rational players, applying game theory for detecting communities helps to identify communities more rationally. Some desirable properties of the utility function, such as the non-resolution limit and the non-scaling behavior, have been examined theoretically. To solve the issue of pre-setting the number and size for communities and to improve the efficiency of the detection process, we have developed a greedy agglomerative manner to identify communities. Extensive experiments have been conducted on synthetic and real networks to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach which can be applied for real world applications. "

We assume that resources have nondecreasing load-dependent costs and player-specific delays. Our model includes the important special case of capacitated facility location problems, where players have to jointly pay for opened facilities. The goal is to design cost sharing protocols so as to minimize the resulting price of anarchy and price of stability. We investigate two classes of protocols: basic protocols guarantee the existence of at least one pure Nash equilibrium and separable protocols additionally require that the resulting cost shares only depend on the set of players on a resource. We find optimal basic and separable protocols that guarantee the price of stability/price of anarchy to grow logarithmically/linearly in the number of players. These results extend our previous results (cf. von Falkenhausen &amp; Harks, 2013), where optimal basic and separable protocols were given for the case of symmetric matroid games without delays. We finally study the complexity of computing optimal cost shares. We derive several hardness results showing that optimal cost shares cannot be approximated in polynomial time within a logarithmic factor in the number of players, unless P = \{NP\} . For a restricted class of problems that include the above hard instances, we devise an approximation algorithm matching the logarithmic bound. "

We propose an axiomatization for this value introducing leveled amalgamation of players. An algorithm to calculate this value is provided and its complexity is studied. Finally we show an applied example computing by this fuzzy value the power of the groups in the European Parliament. "

For static and dynamic games with incomplete information, the Bayesian Nash equilibrium and perfect Bayesian equilibrium, respectively, are used as solution concepts. After presenting a brief review of the static and dynamic games under complete information, the application of these two games in inventory management is illustrated by using a single-period stochastic inventory problem with two competing newsvendors. Next, we illustrate the Bayesian Nash and perfect Bayesian equilibrium solution concepts for the static and dynamic games under incomplete information with two competing newsvendors. The expository nature of our paper may help researchers in inventory/supply chain management gain easy access to the complicated notions related to the games played under incomplete information. "

The analysis of the mackerel crisis is based on a statistical estimation of relevant functional relations, and the behavior of the players is explained using a fully specified empirical model. Simple, non-cooperative game theory shows that all players have an incentive to act non-cooperatively, a result that is robust to changes in basic assumptions regarding demand and cost functions. Thus, using the estimated parameters and functions, simple, non-cooperative game theory cannot explain the cooperative behavior of \{EU\} and Norway during the mackerel crisis. Simple cooperative game theory shows that no player has an incentive to enter a bargaining agreement by forming coalitions, a prediction that is consistent with the actual behavior of the EU, Norway, Iceland and the Faroe Islands between 2010 and 2014 when no bargaining solution was reached. Therefore, the fact that the \{EU\} and Norway entered a bilateral agreement in 2010 and that the EU, Norway and the Faroe Islands reached a bargaining solution in 2014 cannot be explained by simple cooperative game theory. However, actual behavior during the mackerel crisis can be explained by opportunity costs, including alternative fishing possibilities and regulations, rather than actual harvest costs, but we do not have information about the opportunity costs of harvesting mackerel.

Resolution of the encounter is formulated as a combat game; namely, as a pair of competing event-constrained differential games. If exactly one of the players can win, the optimal strategies are determined from a resulting constrained zero-sum-differential game. Otherwise, the optimal strategies are computed from a resulting non-zero-sum game. Since optimal combat strategies frequently may not exist, approximate combat games are also formulated leading to approximate optimal strategies. To illustrate combat games, an example, called the turret game, is considered.

The fundamental issues that are generally encountered in these models are too many options to choose from and the involvement of contradictory decision making criteria. The game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model provides an intelligent decision making mechanism that exploits a game-theoretic environment for analyzing strategic situations between cooperative or conflicting decision making criteria in the probabilistic rough set framework. The concept of equilibria is of central importance in the \{GTRS\} model which has not been sufficiently addressed in the current literature. Two key issues in this regard are the interpretation of equilibria and the establishment of their existence. By reviewing, examining and defining the basic game constructs in the \{GTRS\} model, we are able to interpret an equilibrium in terms of the decision thresholds that control the rough sets based decision regions. In particular, an equilibrium is defined in terms of a pair of thresholds such that no player has a unilateral incentive to change these thresholds within the game. An example game is considered to demonstrate the use of the interpretation in determining the thresholds. The issue of existence of equilibria is addressed by considering a couple of typical two-player games in the \{GTRS\} model. The results suggest that the existence of equilibria may be established under certain limited conditions. "

I propose an evolutionary game model with two subpopulations on the basis of multipopulation replicator dynamics to describe such a situation. In the proposed model, pairs of players are involved in a two-person game as a well-mixed population, and imitation occurs within subpopulations in each of which players have the same payoff matrix. It is shown that the model does not allow any internal equilibrium such that the dynamics differs from that of other related models such as the bimatrix game. In particular, even a slight difference in the payoff matrix in the two subpopulations can make the opposite strategies to be stably selected in the two subpopulations in the snowdrift and coordination games.

Two sets of laboratory experiments on snowdrift game were conducted to investigate human strategy updating rules. Four groups of subjects were modeled by experience-weighted attraction learning theory at individual-level. Three out of the four groups (75%) passed model validation. Substantial heterogeneity is observed among the players who update their strategies in four typical types, whereas rare people behave like belief-based learners even under fixed pairing. Most subjects (63.9%) adopt the reinforcement learning (or alike) rules; but, interestingly, the performance of averaged reinforcement learners suffered. It is observed that two factors seem to benefit players in competition, i.e., the sensitivity to their recent experiences and the overall consideration of forgone payoffs. Moreover, subjects with changing opponents tend to learn faster based on their own recent experience, and display more diverse strategy updating rules than they do with fixed opponent. These findings suggest that most of subjects do apply reinforcement learning alike updating rules even under random rematching, although these rules may not improve their performance. The findings help evolutionary biology researchers to understand sophisticated human behavioral strategies in social dilemmas. "

They form beliefs by learning from past behavior of others and then best respond to these beliefs looking k periods ahead. We establish almost sure convergence of our stochastic process and characterize absorbing sets. These can be very different from the predictions in both the fully rational model and the adaptive, but myopic case. In particular we find that also Non-Nash outcomes can be sustained whenever they satisfy a “local” efficiency condition. We then characterize stochastically stable states in a class of 2 × 2 games and show that under certain conditions the efficient action in Prisoner's Dilemma games and coordination games can be singled out as uniquely stochastically stable. We show that our results are consistent with typical patterns observed in experiments on finitely repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games and in particular can explain what is commonly called the “endgame effect” and the “restart effect”. Finally, if populations are composed of some myopic and some forward looking agents, parameter constellations exist such that either might obtain higher average payoffs. "

Due to limited security resources, full security coverage of targets (infrastructure) at all times is not possible. Efficient surveillance and allocation of security personnel among targets is an important problem in several real life security scenarios. The adversaries may observe and exploit patterns in selective surveillance of targets. Therefore, there is a need for efficiently allocating security personnel to targets. This calls for randomised strategies for personnel allocation and surveillance. We use a game-theoretic approach for modeling and studying such security problems. The problem is modeled as a security game built upon the Stackelberg game model. The game is played between two players - the Leader (Defender) and the Follower (Attacker). Our model provides an optimal randomized strategy for the leader (security personal), under the assumption that the follower (adversary) will conduct surveillance before launching an attack on the target. Analysing the optimal defender's strategies under a variety of settings helps in optimal resource allocation and planning for surveillance. "

This paper studies the management strategies of three kinds of airlines - full service carrier, its subsidiary low cost carrier and rival low cost carrier - based on game theory in the competitive air transport market. Each airline is assumed to act as a player and chooses strategies regarding airfare, flight frequency, and the number of operating aircrafts for specific routes while maximizing its own profits. Demand leakages between the airlines are considered in the flight demand function according to the selected strategies of all airlines. Through various game situations reflecting realistic features, this study provides managerial insights that can be applied in the competitive air transport market. "

Here, we attempt to simulate the strategies submitted to the tournament in a multi-agent context, where individuals play a two-player game with their neighbors. Each individual has one of the strategies, and it plays the Prisoner’s Dilemma with its neighbors. According to actions chosen (cooperate or defect), points of life are subtracted from their profiles. When an individual dies, some fitness functions are defined to choose the most successful strategy which the new individual will copy.

Though there are many variations to this game, there is a common underlying characteristic. As the ball bounces on the cup grid, its sequence of bouncing trajectories becomes nonlinear. It is this nonlinearity which makes it impossible for an observer to predict the outcome, and makes the game difficult. The nonlinearity comes from the interaction of the ball’s linear motion, angular motion, and the how it bounces off the cup edges. The insight that led to the development of this model is that the ball bouncing on a cup edge is equivalent to it bouncing on a tilted surface. Thus, to develop a predictive model for this game, we modeled a spinning partially elastic ball as it bounces over a series of arbitrarily-tilted surfaces. We embedded this algorithm in a Monte Carlo simulation model which simulates a player throwing the ball while varying initial launch parameters. Using this model, we were able to track possible trajectories and make probabilistic statements about various outcomes of the game. Furthermore, we used our empirical results to suggest different scenarios for the game, then applied the model to assess and quantify their impacts on difficulty. Visual inspection and brief analysis of an actual game support our model’s credibility. "

Various solutions based on Game theory have been recently proposed which dealt with security aspects of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). However, the nodes have limited capability of rationality and evolutionary learning which makes it unfavorable to apply conventional game theory in WSNs. Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT) relies on bounded rationality assumption which is in harmony with the wireless sensor networks characteristics. Based on EGT, authors propose an adaptive security model for \{WSNs\} for the selection of cryptographic protocols during runtime. The authors formulate this selection in \{WSNs\} with the help of an evolutionary game to obtain the evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) for the system. In this model, the sensor nodes dynamically adapt their defensive strategies to attain the most efficient defense, corresponding to the attackers’ varied strategies. Further, the simulations convey that the proposed system converges rapidly to the Evolutionary Stable Strategy. Not only the system converges, but also forms a stable system which was verified by deliberately destabilizing the system. Results show that the nodes quickly return to \{ESS\} even after perturbation. "

It is known that dynamics based on generic no-regret algorithms may not converge to Nash equilibria in general, but to a larger set of outcomes, namely coarse correlated equilibria. Moreover, convergence results based on generic no-regret algorithms typically use a weaker notion of convergence: the convergence of the average plays instead of the actual plays. Some work has been done showing that when using a specific no-regret algorithm, the well-known multiplicative updates algorithm, convergence of actual plays to equilibria can be shown and better quality of outcomes in terms of the price of anarchy can be reached for atomic congestion games and load balancing games. Are there more cases of natural no-regret dynamics that perform well in suitable classes of games in terms of convergence and quality of outcomes that the dynamics converge to? We answer this question positively in the bulletin-board model by showing that when employing the mirror-descent algorithm, a well-known generic no-regret algorithm, the actual plays converge quickly to equilibria in nonatomic congestion games. This gives rise to a family of algorithms, including the multiplicative updates algorithm and the gradient descent algorithm as well as many others. Furthermore, we show that our dynamics achieves good bounds on the outcome quality in terms of the price-of-anarchy type of measures with two different social costs: the average individual cost and the maximum individual cost. Finally, the bandit model considers a probably more realistic and prevalent setting with only partial information, in which at each time step each player only knows the cost of her own currently played strategy, but not any costs of unplayed strategies. For the class of atomic congestion games, we propose a family of bandit algorithms based on the mirror-descent algorithms previously presented, and show that when each player individually adopts such a bandit algorithm, their joint (mixed) strategy profile quickly converges with implications.

We derive the general expression for the stationary distribution of strategy under weak selection and compare it with the counterpart of a Moran process. As a result, we find that both in symmetric games and in asymmetric games, the self-referential mechanism always generates a greater gap between the favored and unfavored strategies’ frequencies for a fixed parameter set than does a Moran process. Further, we found that for small mutation rates, our results are almost identical to the counterpart of a Moran process. "

It is often assumed that the players are free to participate in any coalition, but in some situations there are dependency relationships among the players that restrict their capacity to cooperate within some coalitions. Those relationships must be taken into account if we want to distribute the profits fairly. In this respect, several models have been proposed in literature. In all of them dependency relationships are considered to be complete, in the sense that either a player is allowed to fully cooperate within a coalition or they cannot cooperate at all. Nevertheless, in some situations it is possible to consider another option: that a player has a degree of freedom to cooperate within a coalition. A model for those situations is presented. "

Next, we illustrate how coalition theory has been brought in over the past decade to allow the modeling of games with greater than two players, and how coalitional externalities, a major issue in international and shared fish stocks management, have been incorporated recently. Finally, we highlight new areas for game theory to come into its own in fisheries, which will most definitely include the potential for catch rights in international shared-stock fisheries, as well as ecosystem dynamics to be modeled in a game-theoretic context. As game theory can offer insights into the challenges of achieving cooperative fisheries management, we hope the next decade of fisheries economics research will include a bigger leap from academic game theory exercises to impacting policy decisions.

In this paper we consider three different models for PageRank games on undirected graphs such as certain social networks. In undirected graphs players may delete links at will, but typically cannot add links without the other player’s permission. In the deletion-model players are free to delete any of their bidirectional links but may not add links. We study the problem of determining whether the given graph represents a Nash equilibrium or not in this model. We give an O ( n 2 ) time algorithm for a tree, and a parametric O ( 2 k n 4 ) time algorithm for general graphs, where k is the maximum vertex degree in any biconnected component of the graph. In the request-delete-model players are free to delete any bidirectional links and add any directed links, since these additions can be done unilaterally and can be viewed as requests for bidirected links. For this model we give an O ( n 3 ) time algorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in trees. Finally, in the add–delete-model we allow a node to make arbitrary deletions and the addition of a single bidirectional link if it would increase the page rank of the other player also. In this model we give a parametric algorithm for verifying Nash equilibria in general graphs and characterize so called α -insensitive Nash Equilibria. We also give a result showing a large class of graphs where there is an edge addition that causes the PageRank of both of its endpoints to increase, suggesting convergence towards complete subgraphs.

Besides the regular production run, the manufacturer may choose the outsourcing mode due to his production disruption risk and uncertainty of capacity allocation. We find that the manufacturer has no incentive to outsource when both the disruption risk is low enough and his production capacity is large enough. When the disruption risk is sufficiently high, the manufacturer will fully outsource production regardless of the production capacity. There is a zone of order-difference outsourcing where the manufacturer just outsources the part in excess of the certain threshold value. Under the retailer-Stackelberg (RS) game, the manufacturer׳s order-difference outsourcing strategy can induce the retailer to order more items. Unlike RS, the retailer in the manufacturer-Stackelberg (MS) game always orders a quantity equal to that in the classic newsvendor model. Meanwhile, we find that the channel power does not affect the player’s decision except in the zone of order-difference outsourcing. Compared with MS, the dominant retailer can better deal with the uncertainties and make better use of demand information. From the channel׳s perspective, the two players have the different attitudes towards the risks. The dominant manufacturer prefers to forcibly offload production risks to his partner, while the dominant retailer in \{RS\} actively takes the partner׳s risks. "

The Myerson value is a specific allocation rule extending the Shapley value of the game. More recently, the authors studied games with fuzzy communication structures using fuzzy graph-theoretic ideas. Now we propose a general framework in order to define fuzzy Myerson values. Players in a coalition need to measure their profit using their real individual and communication capacities at every moment because these attributes are fuzzy when the game is proposed. So, they look for forming connected coalitions working at the same level. The different ways to obtain these partitions by levels determine different Myerson values for the game. Several interesting examples of these ways are studied in the paper, following known models in games with fuzzy coalitions: the proportional model and the Choquet model. "

They allow for a new look at the role of players’ weights in the context of the weighted Shapley value for the model of weighted games, giving new properties of it.

We formulate mixed integer linear programming models for this problem, considering core stability and strong equilibrium. The objective function looks for minimizing the total cost allocated among the players. Concerned about the difficulties of managing large coalitions in practice, we also study the effect of a maximum cardinality constraint per coalition. We test the models in two applications. One is in collaborative forest transportation and the other one in inventory of spare parts for oil operations. In these situations, collaboration opportunities involving significant savings exist, but for several reasons, it may be better to group the players in different sub-coalitions rather than in the grand coalition. The models we propose are thus relevant for deciding how to partition the set of players. We also prove that if the strong equilibrium model is feasible, its optimal cost is equal to the optimal cost of the core stability model and, consequently, a coalition structure that solves one problem also solves the other problem. We present results that illustrate this property. We also present results where the core stability problem is feasible and the strong equilibrium problem is infeasible. Setting an upper bound on the maximum cardinality of the coalitions, allows us to study the marginal savings of enlarging the cardinality of the coalitions. We find that the marginal savings of allowing one more player significantly decreases as the bound increases. "

There are species of specialist thieves, but more commonly animals will search for both food items and items already found by others, often conspecifics, that can be stolen. This type of behaviour has previously been modelled using a range of approaches. One of these is the Finder–Joiner model, where one animal, the “Finder”, discovers a food patch that takes some time to be consumed. Before consumption of the patch can be completed, another individual, the “Joiner”, discovers the Finder and its food patch, and has the opportunity to attempt to steal it. Depending upon how large the patch was, and how long the Finder has been alone on the patch, there may be much or little food remaining. In this paper, building on previous work, we consider a version of this game where the Finder knows the value of the remaining food patch, but the Joiner does not. We see that depending upon the model parameters, the extra information possessed by the Finder can be beneficial or detrimental in comparison to the case where both individuals have full information.

We study an atomic dynamic routing scenario, where players allocate resources with load dependent costs only for some limited time. Our paper introduces a natural discrete version of the deterministic queuing model introduced by Koch and Skutella (2011). In this model the time a user needs to traverse an edge  e is given by a constant travel time and the waiting time in a queue at the end of  e . At each discrete time step the first u e  users of the queue proceed to the end vertex of  e , where u e denotes the capacity of the edge  e . An important aspect of this model is that it ensures the \{FIFO\}  property. We study the complexity of central algorithmic questions for this model such as determining an optimal flow in an empty network, an optimal path in a congested network or a maximum dynamic flow and the question whether a given flow is a Nash equilibrium. For the bottleneck case, where the cost of each user is the travel time of the slowest edge on her path, the main results here are mostly bad news. Computing social optima and Nash equilibria turns out to be \{NP\} -complete and the Price of Anarchy is given by the number of users. We also consider the makespan objective (arrival time of the last user) and show that optimal solutions and Nash equilibria in these games, where every user selfishly tries to minimize her travel time, can be found efficiently.

So far as we know, no study have yet been attempted for constrained matrix games with payoffs of \{TFNs\} since there is no effective way to simultaneously incorporate the payoffs’ fuzziness and strategies’ constraints into classical and/or fuzzy matrix game methods. The aim of this paper is to develop an effective methodology for solving constrained matrix games with payoffs of TFNs. In this methodology, we introduce the concepts of Alpha-constrained matrix games for constrained matrix games with payoffs of \{TFNs\} and the values. By the duality theorem of linear programming, it is proven that players’ gain-floor and loss-ceiling always have a common interval-type value and hereby any Alpha-constrained matrix game has an interval-type value. Moreover, using the representation theorem for the fuzzy set, it is proven that any constrained matrix game with payoffs of \{TFNs\} always has a TFN-type fuzzy value. The auxiliary linear programming models are derived to compute the lower and upper bounds of the interval-type value and optimal strategies of players for any Alpha-constrained matrix game. In particular, the mean and the lower and upper limits of the TFN-type fuzzy value of any constrained matrix game with payoffs of \{TFNs\} can be directly obtained through solving the derived three linear programming models with data taken from only 1-cut and 0-cut of payoffs. Hereby the TFN-type fuzzy value of any constrained matrix game with payoffs of \{TFNs\} are easily computed. The proposed method in this paper is compared with other methods and its validity and applicability are illustrated with a numerical example. "

We consider random tie strength values drawn from distributions with different heterogeneity. We show that cooperation is significantly promoted if players preferentially allocate their investments to the friends with strong relationships. The facilitation of cooperation relies mostly on the heterogeneous distribution of relationships and the subsequent investment preference, resulting in strong cooperative allies between good friends and the formation of cooperative clusters around such allies. Moreover, we discover that the investment preference has a sophisticated impact on the evolution of cooperation. Consequently, the level of cooperation will be greatly enhanced by a weak investment preference, but will be significantly depressed if such preference exceeds a critical value. We attribute this finding to the extreme allocation of investments brought by strong preference that hinders the diffusion of cooperative strategy all over the network. Our results suggest that heterogeneous relationships and the subsequent investment preference might have played a crucial role by the evolution of cooperation amongst egoistic individuals. "

Large quantities of simulations demonstrate that the cooperation behavior will be obviously influenced by the reputation threshold ( R C ), and the greater the threshold, the higher the fraction of cooperators. The origin of promotion of cooperation will be attributed to the fact that the larger reputation threshold renders the higher heterogeneity in the fraction of two types of players and strategy spreading capability. Our work is conducive to a better understanding of the emergence of cooperation within many real-world systems. "

abstract = "Abstract Shifting agricultural land management to one that promotes the use of biological control alongside insecticide spray, requires two key elements: 1) habitat for natural enemies provided by non-crop area within the agricultural landscape, and 2) judicious use of insecticides by farmers. However, barriers to adoption may include low levels of knowledge regarding pests and natural enemies, and the difficulties associated with coordinating among community members. The acts of practicing cautious spraying and of leaving aside land as non-crop habitat (NCH) for natural enemies incur private costs for benefits shared by the community. In this study we tie together several objectives within the analysis of a framed field experiment built around pest management decisions in a smallholder agricultural context. We present results from a within-subjects design (multiple treatments per game group) that estimates a decision model which links behavior back to characteristics of the game, the players, and their group. We examine the relative role these sets of characteristics have in explaining variations in the modeled decisions, including how farmers respond to a nudge (a flat subsidy for allowing land to sit as non-crop habitat) to promote natural enemy services on the land. We observe that group-level characteristics appear to have the greatest roles in explaining how decisions by individuals are made. That is to say, the decision of whether to adopt greater use of \{NCH\} has more to do with those around the farmer than the traits of the farmer him or herself. From a policy point of view, it is a signal that (if such game outcomes have any bearing on farm-level decisions) conventional data tools (such as household-level data products from household surveys or censuses) may be inadequate in evaluating appropriate incentives, and newer approaches that identify social networks and neighbor/community interactions may be important.

However, due to the existence of malicious workers in the open outsourced environment, offering high accuracy computing services is critical and challenging. A practical solution for this class of problems is to replicate outsourced tasks and compare the replicated task results, or to verify task results by the outsourcer herself. However, since most outsourced computing services are not free, the portion of tasks to be replicated or verified is restricted by the outsourcer’s budget. In this paper, we propose Integrity Assurance Outsourced Computing (IAOC) system, which employs probabilistic task replication, probabilistic task verification and credit management techniques to offer a high accuracy guarantee for the generalized outsourced computing jobs. Based on \{IAOC\} system, we perform theoretical analysis and model the behaviors of \{IAOC\} system and the attacker as a two-player zero sum game. We propose two algorithms, Interactive Gradient Descent (IGD) algorithm and Tiered Interactive Gradient Descent (TIGD) algorithm that can find the optimal parameter settings under user’s accuracy requirement, without or with considering user’s budget requirement. We prove that the parameter setting generated by IGD/TIGD algorithm form a Nash Equilibrium, and also suggests an accuracy lower bound. Our experiments show that even in the most severe situation, where the malicious workers dominate the outsourced computing environment, our algorithm is able to find the parameter settings satisfying user’s budget and accuracy requirement.

Evolutionary results show that individuals characterized by fairness ( α → 0.5 ) and moderate kindness ( β &lt; 0 , β → 0.0 ) prevail over other individuals. Further analysis demonstrates that individuals’ kindness rather than fairness increases the average payoff of the whole population. Moreover, we conclude that the emergence of kindness is promoted by the spatial structure, and eventually the evolutionary advantage is gained by kindness. "

Solving a game theoretic problem, even in the case of two players, has been known to be intractable.

Existence and stability of equilibria of this system are studied. We show that the model gives more complex chaotic and unpredictable trajectories as a consequence of change in the speed of adjustment of the players. If this parameter is varied, the stability of Nash equilibrium is lost through period doubling bifurcations. The chaotic features are justified numerically via computing Lyapunov numbers and sensitive dependence on initial conditions. "

We go beyond the conventional Prisoners’ Dilemma, with its limiting assumptions of players’ preferences and symmetry, to explore a larger pool of 2 × 2 games that may effectively model the problem. After classifying firm types according to collaboration motive and relative power, we use simulation to explore the effects of firm type, opponent type, and payoff structure on repeated innovation interactions (or, equivalently, long-term relations) and optimality of ‘niceness’. Surprisingly, we find that opponent type is essentially irrelevant in long-term innovation interactions, and focal firm type is only conditionally relevant. The paper contributes further by introducing reciprocation of strategy type (nice versus mean), showing that reciprocation is recommended, while identifying and explaining the exceptions to this conclusion.

Detailed mathematical models are obtained for both deterministic and dynamic cases respectively. Then certain more complicated \{NEGs\} are explored. They are: (i) \{NEG\} with strategies of different length information, which allows some players use longer history information such as the information at t and t – 1 or so; (ii) \{NEG\} with Multi-Species, which allows an \{NEG\} with various kinds of players, they play several different fundamental network games according to their identities. (iii) \{NEG\} with time-varying payoffs. Since payoffs determine the evolution, the network profile dynamics will be a time-varying one. These more complicated \{NEGs\} can cover more general evolutions and they generalized the method proposed in Cheng et al. (Preprint2013). "

We start off by introducing and characterizing the non-cooperative game among transmitter/receiver pairs when the network topology is deterministically given. The corresponding Nash equilibria are derived, highlighting their dependency on the topological parameters (distances between wireless nodes, propagation model, and background noise power). The analysis is then extended to the case of random network topologies drawn from a given spatial stochastic process. Tools of stochastic geometry are leveraged to derive a statistical characterization of the equilibria of the spectrum sharing game. Finally, a distributed algorithm is proposed to let the players of the spectrum sharing game converge to equilibria conditions. Numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm drives the users to stable points that are close to the equilibria of the game requiring limited information exchange among nodes. "

An additional cause of conflict in such social dilemmas is heterogeneity. Cultural differences or financial inequity often interfere with decision making when a diverse group of individuals interact. We address these issues in situations where individuals are either rich or poor. Often, it is unclear how rich and poor individuals should interact – should the poor invest the same as the rich, or should the rich assist the poor? Which distribution of efforts can be considered as fair? To address the effects of heterogeneity on decisions, we model a collective-risk dilemma where players collectively have to invest more than a certain threshold, with heterogeneity and multiple rounds. We aim to understand the natural behavior and to infer which strategies are particularly stable in such asymmetric collective-risk games. Large scale individual based simulations show that when the poor players have half of the wealth the rich players posses, the poor contribute only when early contributions are made by the rich players. The rich contribute on behalf of the poor only when their own external assets are worth protecting. Under a certain degree of uncertainty we observe the rich maintain cooperation by assisting the poor. "

The inefficiency of pure Nash equilibria is assessed by the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and Price of Statibility (PoS). First, when the jobs' total length is no larger than a single machine's activation cost, we demonstrate that m is the tightness upper bound of PoA and PoS equals to 1. Then, for the case that the total length is large, we prove that the PoA is tightly bounded by ( m + 1 ) / 2 . Finally, a lower bound of the PoS is also given. "

We model this system as a game between five types of players: countries; central banks; banks; firms; and households. In this framework, we model strategic choices, conduct sensitivity analysis, and analyze the impacts of random shocks in two examples. Our results demonstrate that each of the three causes discussed above (contagion through credit channels, contagion through trade channels, or common macroeconomic conditions with no contagion) can lead to crises even if all agents in the model behave rationally.

In indoor bowling the game is played on a flat wooden or synthetic surface. To increase the probability of hitting the maximum number of pins, players often impart an initial spin that makes the ball curve and hit the target at an angle. For a right-handed player, the usual curve goes from right to left and is known as a “hook shot”. In this paper, a volumetric contact model has been used to simulate the “hook shot” by modeling the interaction between the ball and the lane. The principal objective is to study the effectiveness of the modeling framework towards the study of the effects of the lane friction and the initial kinematic conditions on the trajectory of the shot. The construction of the core of the ball and the variation of its radii of gyration will also be investigated for their contributions towards the “hook”. "

abstract = "Abstract Owing to the distributed nature of denial-of-service attacks, it is tremendously challenging to detect such malicious behavior using traditional intrusion detection systems in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In the current paper, a game theoretic method is introduced, namely cooperative Game-based Fuzzy Q-learning (G-FQL). G-FQL adopts a combination of both the game theoretic approach and the fuzzy Q-learning algorithm in WSNs. It is a three-player strategy game consisting of sink nodes, a base station, and an attacker. The game performs at any time a victim node in the network receives a flooding packet as a \{DDoS\} attack beyond a specific alarm event threshold in WSN. The proposed model implements cooperative defense counter-attack scenarios for the sink node and the base station to operate as rational decision-maker players through a game theory strategy. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) was simulated using NS-2 simulator. The model is subsequently compared against other existing soft computing methods, such as fuzzy logic controller, Q-learning, and fuzzy Q-learning, in terms of detection accuracy, counter-defense, network lifetime and energy consumption, to demonstrate its efficiency and viability. The proposed model׳s attack detection and defense accuracy yield a greater improvement than existing above-mentioned machine learning methods. In contrast to the Markovian game theoretic, the proposed model operates better in terms of successful defense rate. "

Specifically, players of two types are considered: (A) pragmatic agents, who do not distinguish between the different roles and aim to obtain the same benefit, and (B) agents whose aspiration levels and offers are independent. We investigate the evolution of altruistic behavior in pure populations with two different effective payoffs: accumulated payoffs and normalized payoffs. It is found that, for type B individuals, if the low-degree individuals can act as proposers with larger probabilities, the average value of offers reaches a higher point, irrespective of whether accumulated or normalized payoffs are used for strategy updating; for type A individuals, the two calculation methods for payoff lead to different outcomes.

The power of the player is limited in the sense that he can defend at most d additional vertices of G in each round. His objective is to save as many vertices as possible from burning. Most research on this game concerned the case f = d = 1 , which already leads to hard problems even restricted to trees. We study the game for larger values of f and d . We present useful properties of optimal strategies for the game on trees, efficient approximation algorithms, and bounds on the so-called surviving rate. "

A classic test of cooperation is the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game, where two players receive varying payoffs for cooperation or defection in repeated trials. To determine whether unrelated rats cooperate in the IPD, we tested pairs of rats making operant responses to earn food reward in 25 trials/day. The operant chamber was bisected by a metal screen with a retractable lever and pellet dispenser on each side. When levers extended, rats had 2 s to respond. Mutual cooperation (Reward) delivered three pellets each, mutual defection (Punishment) provided no pellets, and unilateral defection (Temptation) gave five pellets to the defector, while the partner (Sucker) received none. In eight pairs of males (RM−) and females (RF−), cooperation was defined by withholding a response. In seven pairs of RM+ males, cooperation was defined by responding on the lever. In males, food restriction significantly inhibited both cooperation and pellets received. There was no effect of dominance status. Males and females made similar numbers of responses under ad libitum feeding. However, neither food restriction nor dominance status affected responses in females. Rats were subsequently tested for reciprocity in 24 alternating trials/day. A response on the lever within 5 s delivered three pellets to the partner. Females made significantly more responses for their cage-mate than males. Responses within pairs were significantly correlated for males, but not for females. For both sexes, responses declined significantly when paired with an unfamiliar partner who never reciprocated (‘bad stooge’). These results demonstrate that rats working for food show cooperation in \{IPD\} and direct reciprocity. Their responses depend on food availability and responses of their partner. "

abstract = "Abstract In this paper, energy trading for the distributed smart grid architecture is projected as an incomplete information game—a viewpoint that contrasts from all the existing pieces of literature available on the broader issue of energy management in smart grid. The incomplete information is considered as the real-time demand and price to grid and customers, respectively, due to the packet loss in the communication network. Therefore, the paper addresses a realistic scenario, in which real-time information to the destination may not be guaranteed to be received adequately, due to the packet loss. In the proposed scheme, we introduce two types of intelligent agents—customer-agents and grid-agent. The customer-agents are deployed at the customers׳ end, and are capable of estimating adequately the real-time price decided by the grid. On the contrary, the grid-agent is deployed at the service provider׳s end, and are also capable of estimating adequate real-time energy demand from the customers. Therefore, one of the key advantage of the proposed agent-based scheme is that the customers and the grid are not involved in complex calculations in order to take real-time decisions for cost-effective energy management, while there is information loss in the communication networks. In the proposed game model, the grid-agent and the customers agents are the players, and estimate real-time demand and price based on the probability of belief to each other. We show the existence of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium in the proposed model, where the utility of the players is maximized. We compare the real-time price with and without packet loss as the price with incomplete and complete information, respectively. We observe that the proposed model is beneficial for the grid, as its utility is maximized. The simulation results show that the utility of the grid increases approximately 40% over that of the existing ones under the scenario of information incompleteness. "

However, most previous studies have focused on the single dimensional affective motive of online game use. The multi-dimensional affective motivational aspects of entertainment technologies have been relatively neglected. In addition, previous studies report inconsistent relationships between motives and online game usage. To fill these gaps in the literature, the present study proposes five experiential motives such as concentration, enjoyment, escape, epistemic curiosity, and social affiliation as predictors of intention to play online games. External locus of control is also introduced as a moderator in the links between experiential motives and intention. The model was tested with the data from 576 current online game players who answered online survey. Structural equation model analysis confirmed that three experiential motives with the exception of concentration and epistemic curiosity have a positive effect on intention. χ2 difference test confirmed that the coefficients linking experiential motives such as concentration, enjoyment, and escape to intention are higher for people with external locus of control than for people with internal locus of control. Implications are discussed in conclusion. "

Because sensor nodes have limited capabilities in terms of their computation, communication, and energy, selecting the profitable detection strategy for lowering resources consumption determines whether the \{IDS\} can be used practically. In this paper, we adopt the distributed-centralized network in which each sensor node has equipped an \{IDS\} agent, but only the \{IDS\} agent resided in the Cluster Head (CH) with sufficient energy will launch. Then, we apply the signaling game to construct an Intrusion Detection Game modeling the interactions between a malicious sensor node and a CH-IDS agent, and seek its equilibriums for the optimal detection strategy. We illustrate the stage Intrusion Detection Game at an individual time slot in aspects of its player’s utilities, pure-strategy Bayesian–Nash equilibrium (BNE) and mixed-strategy BNE. Under these \{BNEs\} the CH-IDS agent is not always on the Defend strategy, as a result, the power of \{CH\} can be saved. As the game evolves, we develop the stage Intrusion Detection Game into a multi-stage dynamic Intrusion Detection Game in which, based on Bayesian rules, the beliefs on the malicious sensor node can be updated. Upon the current belief and the Perfect Bayesian equilibrium (PBE), the best response strategy for the CH-IDS agent can be gained. Afterward, we propose an intrusion detection mechanism and corresponding algorithm. We also study the properties of the multi-stage dynamic Intrusion Detection Game by simulations. The simulation results have shown the effectiveness of the proposed game, thus, the CH-IDS agents are able to select their optimal strategies to defend the malicious sensor nodes’ Attack action. "

However, the impact of terrorist’s private information may significantly affect such government’s first-mover advantage, which has not been extensively studied in the literature. To explore the impact of asymmetry in terrorist’s attributes between government and terrorist on defense equilibrium, we propose a model in which the government chooses between disclosure (sequential game) and secrecy (simultaneous game) of her defense system. Our analysis shows that the government’s first-mover advantage in a sequential game is considerable only when both government and terrorist share relatively similar valuation of targets. In contrast, we interestingly find that the government no longer benefits from the first-mover advantage by exposing her defense levels when the degree of divergence between government and terrorist valuation of targets is high. This is due to the robustness of defense system under secrecy, in the sense that all targets should be defended in equilibrium irrespective of how the terrorist valuation of targets is different to government. We identify two phenomena that lead to this result. First, when the terrorist holds a significantly higher valuation of targets than the government’s belief, the government may waste her budget in a sequential game by over-investing on the high-valued targets. Second, when the terrorist holds a significantly lower valuation of targets, the government may incur a higher expected damage in a sequential game because of not defending the low-valued targets. Finally, we believe that this paper provides some novel insights to homeland security resource allocation problems. "

We use the well known framework of hybrid automata for modeling hybrid systems, and try do detect faults exploiting a Fault Diagnosis Game on them, with two players: the environment and the diagnoser. The environment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a fault occurs. The diagnoser observes the external behavior of the system and announces whether a fault has occurred or not. The case study we introduce here is a simplified model of a camera mounted on a mobile rover that has to take pictures of some defined locations of the environment. We add the possibility of a stuck fault on the camera motor to apply the theory and show its effectiveness. "

The aim of this paper is to develop a simple and an effective linear programming method for solving matrix games in which the payoffs are expressed with intervals. Because the payoffs of the matrix game are intervals, the value of the matrix game is an interval as well. Based on the definition of the value for matrix games, the value of the matrix game may be regarded as a function of values in the payoff intervals, which is proven to be non-decreasing. A pair of auxiliary linear programming models is formulated to obtain the upper bound and the lower bound of the value of the interval-valued matrix game by using the upper bounds and the lower bounds of the payoff intervals, respectively. By the duality theorem of linear programming, it is proven that two players have the identical interval-type value of the interval-valued matrix game. Also it is proven that the linear programming models and method proposed in this paper extend those of the classical matrix games. The linear programming method proposed in this paper is demonstrated with a real investment decision example and compared with other similar methods to show the validity, applicability and superiority.

The decision process is modelled by a Stackelberg game where the supplier, as a leader, determines the capacity and the wholesale price, and the retailer, as a follower, determines the sale price and lead time. The equilibrium strategy of these two players is obtained. By comparing with the performance of the corresponding decentralized chain without capacity decision as a benchmark, we characterize the impact of capacity decision on the players’ profit, i.e., the supplier׳s profit may be always significantly increased while the retailer's profit is only increased when the capacity is underestimated in the benchmark model. Further, we demonstrate that the integration of capacity decision can also significantly reduce the profit loss caused by double marginalization. Finally, we find that the revenue-sharing and two-part tariff contracts cannot coordinate the decentralized channel. Instead, we propose a franchise contract with a contingent rebate that can achieve channel coordination and a win–win outcome. "

abstract = "Abstract In public goods game (PGG), player’s cooperative behavior is not pure economical rationality, but social preference and prosocial intuition play extremely important roles as well. Social preference and prosocial intuition can be guided by heuristics from one’s neighbors in daily life. To better investigate the impacts of heuristics on the evolution of cooperation, four types of agents are introduced into our spatial PGG. Through numerical simulations, results show that the larger percentages of cooperators with independent thought, the easier emergence and maintenance of collective cooperative behaviors. Additionally, we find that differentia heuristic capability has great effect on the equilibrium of PGG. Cooperation can be obviously promoted, when heuristic capability of cooperators with independent thought is stronger than that of defectors with independent thought. Finally, we observe that cooperators with independent thought and defectors with independent thought are favorable for the formation of some high quality clusters, which can resist the invasion between each other. Our work may help us understand more clearly the mechanism of cooperation in real world. "

A discrete and dynamic system is built for the case that a boundedly rational player adjusts its investment decision by the locally marginal profit and a naïve player chooses its strategy according to the opponent’s action in the previous period. By stability analysis of the system, we show that the boundary equilibrium is unstable and obtain the stability conditions for the interior equilibrium. Numerical simulations are used to provide evidence for the influence of the model parameters on the system stability and on the complicated behaviors in the system evolution. It is shown that the system with varying model parameters may drive to chaos and the loss of stability may be caused by period doubling bifurcations or Neimark–Sacker bifurcations. It is also shown that the time-delayed feedback control method can be used to keep the system from instability and chaos. All the numerical simulations show that the capital depreciation rate has great influence on the system evolution: a smaller depreciation rate has a stronger stabilization effect on the survival of the system and makes the system easier to control from chaos.

However, the problem on how to choose the servers so as to maximize the duration of the network still remains an issue. To this aim, we propose an Integer Programming model and a heuristic based on it: preliminary experimental results show the effectiveness and the potential of the approach. "

The game of ‘Hip’ is named because of the hipster's reputed disdain for ‘squares’. The rule of the game is to place the counters on a checkerboard so that four of them do not mark the corners of a square. The square may be of any size and be tipped at any angle. Normally this game is played by two players, where the game on a six-by-six checkerboard is the maximum size for the solution. The solution means that every player can place all the counters on the checkerboard without violations. In other words, the goal of our algorithm is to find the pattern of a draw game between players where they should not mark the corners of a square. In order to enlarge the size of the checkerboard where a solution exists, we modified the game as n/2 players play on an n-by-n checkerboard where n is an even number. The proposed parallel algorithm requires m × n2 processing elements for the m-player-n-by-n-checkerboard game to find the solution of the ‘Hip’ games. The algorithm is verified by solving six games where the size of the checkerboard is varied from 4 to 12. "

The behavior of each carrier is characterized by an optimization model with the objective to maximize his payoff by setting optimal freight rate and shipping deployment (a combination of service frequency and ship capacity setting). The market share for each carrier is determined by the Logit-based discrete choice model. Three competitive game strategic interactions are further investigated, namely, Nash game, Stackelberg game and deterrence by taking account of the economies of scale of the ship capacity settings. Three corresponding competition models with discrete pure strategy are formulated as the variables in shipment deployment are indivisible and the pricing adjustment is step-wise in practice. A ɛ -approximate equilibrium and related numerical solution algorithm are proposed to analyze the effect of Nash equilibrium. Finally, the developed models are numerically evaluated by a case study. The case study shows that, with increasing container demand in the market, expanding ship capacity setting is preferable due to its low marginal cost. Furthermore, Stackelberg equilibrium is a prevailing strategy in most market situations since it makes players attain more benefits from the accommodating market. Moreover, the deterrence effects largely depend on the deterrence objective. An aggressive deterrence strategy may make potential monopolist suffer large benefit loss and an easing strategy has little deterrence effect. "

Such real-time coaction is not captured by the iterated prisoner׳s dilemma and other discrete-time reciprocal cooperation games, which inherently feature a delay in information exchange. Here, we study the evolution of cooperation when individuals can dynamically respond to each other׳s actions. We develop continuous-time analogues of iterated-game models and describe their dynamics in terms of two variables, the propensity of individuals to initiate cooperation (altruism) and their tendency to mirror their partner׳s actions (coordination). These components of cooperation stabilize at an evolutionary equilibrium or show oscillations, depending on the chosen payoff parameters. Unlike reciprocal altruism, cooperation by coaction does not require that those willing to initiate cooperation pay in advance for uncertain future benefits. Correspondingly, we show that introducing a delay to information transfer between players is equivalent to increasing the cost of cooperation. Cooperative coaction can therefore evolve much more easily than reciprocal cooperation. When delays entirely prevent coordination, we recover results from the discrete-time alternating prisoner׳s dilemma, indicating that coaction and reciprocity are connected by a continuum of opportunities for real-time information exchange.

In this article, we discuss reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique for solving sequential decision making problems with large state spaces. We describe how reinforcement learning can be combined with a function approximation method to avoid both the curse of dimensionality and the curse of modelling. To illustrate the usefulness of this approach, we apply it to a problem with a huge state space—learning to play the game of Othello. We describe experiments in which reinforcement learning agents learn to play the game of Othello without the use of any knowledge provided by human experts. It turns out that the reinforcement learning agents learn to play the game of Othello better than players that use basic strategies. "

In this article, we develop the theory of equilibrium checking, a related but distinct problem. Equilibrium checking is relevant for multi-agent systems in which system components (agents) are assumed to be acting rationally in pursuit of delegated goals, and is concerned with understanding what temporal properties hold of such systems under the assumption that agents select strategies in equilibrium. The formal framework we use to study this problem assumes agents are modelled using Reactive Modules, a system modelling language that is used in a range of practical model checking systems. Each agent (or player) in a Reactive Modules game is specified as a nondeterministic guarded command program, and each player's goal is specified with a temporal logic formula that the player desires to see satisfied. A strategy for a player in a Reactive Modules game defines how that player selects enabled guarded commands for execution over successive rounds of the game. For this general setting, we investigate games in which players have goals specified in Linear Temporal Logic (in which case it is assumed that players choose deterministic strategies) and in Computation Tree Logic (in which case players select nondeterministic strategies). For each of these cases, after formally defining the game setting, we characterise the complexity of a range of problems relating to Nash equilibria (e.g., the computation or the verification of existence of a Nash equilibrium or checking whether a given temporal formula is satisfied on some Nash equilibrium). We then go on to show how the model we present can be used to encode, for example, games in which the choices available to players are specified using \{STRIPS\} planning operators. "

Maintenance expenditures improve the quality of the machines but are costly. Production, on the other hand, yields revenue to the firm, but reduces the quality of the machines. Assuming that the two departments will make a decision on maintenance expenditures and production rate in a cooperative mood, we are looking for a Pareto-optimal solution. Using phase diagram analysis it turns out that the equilibrium in state-costate plane is a saddle point, implying (in the most realistic cases) decresing maintenance expenditures and increasing production rate. It is interesting to note that the basic features of the Pareto solution are the same as in the one player solution (i.e. the optimal control problem). Also, some similarities with the non-cooperative Nash solution are pointed out. "

The authors use the Nash and Maxi-min stability definitions to analyze 25 two-by-two ordinal games, which they recognize as “possible game-theoretic characterizations of climate negotiations between two players (e.g., Great Powers or coalitions of states)”. The authors' main conclusion that the Prisoner's Dilemma might not be the best description of climate negotiations game is consistent with the findings of others who have studied two-by-two conflicts over natural commons (Bardhan, 1993; Madani, 2010; Sandler, 1992; Taylor, 1987). Nevertheless, given the importance of the climate change issue, as well as the potential effects of our actions on the state of the environment and the well-being of future generations, I would like to address some gaps in their analysis, which result in it having limited usefulness for policy purposes. Of course, all models are simplified representations of reality, full of limitations. “Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful” (Box and Draper, 1987). So, “the practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful” (Box and Draper, 1987). Models' limitations need to be carefully considered when interpreting them or applying their results to policy but some models are too simple to provide useful policy advice. "

The advantage of this design is flexibility of the rule definition, supports many game mechanic and dynamic, as well as accommodates multirole playing and multiplayer games. The Excellence is achieved through representation of an access as actionID, Heuristic Value, Role name, Prerequisite, Impact. Prerequisite and impact are represented into a positive sentence of first order predicate calculus with the \{AND\} operator. The predicate in pre-requisite sentences express status and criteria. Predicate in impact have been identified 4 kinds, namely increment, decrement, add, and sets. Are those representative for update status, still need more research .Game mechanic was accommodated through status that be represented in (type of status; objects; attributes; criteria). Valid Type of status includes xpoint, redeemable Point, level/badge, progress, stuff, ownership, and time. Game Dynamic was accommodated through the discretion to perform user defined action. But the form of human computer interaction of such action has not been designed. Heuristic value on the model is filled by game designer and designed to support the delivery guidance to the player automatically, by suggesting optimal actions to achieve goals using Forward A* Search. Moreover three modules of Forward Intelligent Searching are designed, ie first to update the state of action based on current status. There are three kinds of state, namely the ‘lock’, ‘open’, ‘closed’. The second is to update the status automatically based on the selected action to be executed. The third is execute automatic action that be triggered by status or by time. They all refer to the rule of the game are defined in the ‘access’ "

abstract = "SummaryIntroduction Video games are part of our society's major entertainments. This is now a global industry that covers the preferential activity of adolescents. But for some, the practice goes beyond a game and becomes an addictive functioning. Clinical practice is then faced with a new problem. It is important to understand the special bond that develops between a player and his/her video game in order to understand the addictive process. Background The game consists of a virtual world, a graphical construction that is a simulation of reality and which reinvents the laws that govern it. It also consists of a character embodied by the player who controls it: the avatar. Through the virtual world and avatar, the game offers the player a virtual personification that matches his/her expectations and projected ideal. The avatar allows the subject to compensate, or even to modify some aspects of the Self and thus enhance his/her perception of him/herself; the virtual life become more satisfying than real life. Objectives The aim of this research is to propose, from the study of the relationship between psychosocial variables (self-perception and life satisfaction) and the adolescent's practice of video games, elements of construction of an explanatory model of video gambling addiction. Methods The population of this research is composed of 74 adolescents aged 11–14 years (mage = 12.78 and \{SD\} = 0.921). Fourteen are identified as addicted to video games by the results of the Game Addiction Scale. The quantitative methodology allows measurement of the different psychosocial variables which appear important in the addictive process. The instruments used are: the Game Addiction Scale, the Self-Perception Profile and the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Results The results show that adolescents addicted to video games see their virtual and current Self as being less proficient than other teenagers. Furthermore, teenagers addicted to video games see their virtual Self as more proficient and adapted to the environment than their current Self. Moreover, adolescents addicted perceive their lives as less satisfying than others’. Hence, virtual life is perceived as more satisfying than real life among teenagers addicted to video games. Finally, this virtual experience is thus one of the factors that explain the addiction to video games. Through the game, the teenager can “live” a new version of him/herself, becoming secondarily alienating. The virtual world supplants real life and becomes the source of a clash of identity. "

This paper follows Robsonʼs approach but assumes that a more complex mutation in both the type and the behavior is an order of magnitude less likely than a simpler mutation in only the type or the behavior. In weakly acyclic games, every long-run stable strategy profile is a strict Nash equilibrium. Meanwhile, a Pareto undominated strict Nash equilibrium is stochastically stable if for each player, the opponentsʼ equilibrium action profile uniquely maximizes his payoff given his equilibrium action. These results can be generalized to generic cyclic two-person games. In a common interests game, a strategy profile is selected if and only if it yields the unique Pareto efficient payoff vector. "

Evolutionary game theory is typically thought of as a phenotypic approach, although it is frequently argued that it can also be used to describe population genetic evolution. Interpreting the interaction between alleles in a diploid genome as a two player game leads to interesting alternative perspectives on genetic evolution. Here we focus on the case of meiotic drive and illustrate how meiotic drive can be directly and precisely interpreted as a social dilemma, such as the prisoners dilemma or the snowdrift game, in which the drive allele takes more than its fair share. Resistance to meiotic drive can lead to the well understood cyclic dominance found in the rock–paper–scissors game. This perspective is well established for the replicator dynamics, but there is still considerable ground for mutual inspiration between the two fields. For example, evolutionary game theorists can benefit from considering the stochastic evolutionary dynamics arising from finite population size. Population geneticists can benefit from game theoretic tools and perspectives on genetic evolution. "

In a very large range of the parameters moving ability enhances cooperation, but under some special condition, velocity heavily depresses cooperation. Some explanations have also been given out by investigating the strategy-change behavior of players. The findings may be helpful in understanding cooperative behavior in natural and social systems consisting of mobile agents. "

In this work, we performed laboratory experiments on the \{RPS\} game and analyzed the social-state evolutionary trajectories of twelve populations of N = 6 players. We found strong evidence supporting the existence of persistent cycles. The mean cycling frequency was measured to be 0.029 ± 0.009 period per experimental round. Our experimental observations can be quantitatively explained by a simple non-equilibrium model, namely the discrete-time logit dynamical process with a noise parameter. Our work therefore favors the evolutionary game theory over the classical game theory for describing the dynamical behavior of the \{RPS\} game. "

The results for knowledge-related and strategic problems show that individuals’ decisions change upon receiving more informative and sophisticated arguments and remain the same otherwise. This individual behavior is an essential part of the information aggregation in teams and can explain the advantage of teams in decision making and in games. "

This paper will propose a new approach for the multi-objective multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) problems in non-cooperative environments based on gene expression programming (GEP) and Nash equilibrium in the game theory. In this approach, the \{GEP\} method is used as a surrogate to construct the approximate rational reaction sets (RRSs) in the Nash model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by the design of a thin-walled pressure vessel and the hull form parameter design of a small waterplane area twin hull (SWATH) ship. The results show that this approach can fully explore and provide the explicit functional relationship between the strategy of an isolated player and the control variables of the other players, thus able to obtain a better Nash equilibrium solution.

However, due to lack of coordination between the femtocell and the macrocell, designing a distributive resource and power allocation is a challenging task. In this study, a potential game (PG)-theoretic approach is proposed for joint resource and power allocation (JRPA), which is demonstrated to exhibit unique Nash Equilibrium. Specifically, femto-base stations, which are considered as the players of the PG, learn the strategies in terms of resource and power allocation by taking into account the interest of other entities. To this end, the utility function of players is designed such that it minimizes the impact interference and the satisfaction for improving the femtocell capacity, without jeopardizing the macrocell performance. Precisely, the utility function incorporates all the sources of interference such as co-tier and cross-tier, and also the reward of each player in terms of capacity. The proposed PG-based \{JRPA\} is solved by employing the better response dynamics, which selects the resources and the power levels by utilizing a particle swarm optimization-constriction factor model. The performance of PG-based \{JRPA\} is analyzed in regard to average femtocell capacity and system capacity. Additionally, two different traffic cases are considered: high load traffic and low load traffic. For the sake of comparison, random allocation is employed. Simulation results are carried out in terms of the performance metrics, which includes convergence, min-max capacity, varying resource blocks, femtocell density and fairness. The results illustrate the superior performance of the proposed \{PG\} in terms of the aforementioned performance metrics. "

Owing to the intrinsic stochastic and frequency-dependent nature of learning dynamics, these rules are often studied in evolutionary biology via agent-based computer simulations. In this paper, we show that stochastic approximation theory can help to qualitatively understand learning dynamics and formulate analytical models for the evolution of learning rules. We consider a population of individuals repeatedly interacting during their lifespan, and where the stage game faced by the individuals fluctuates according to an environmental stochastic process. Individuals adjust their behavioral actions according to learning rules belonging to the class of experience-weighted attraction learning mechanisms, which includes standard reinforcement and Bayesian learning as special cases. We use stochastic approximation theory in order to derive differential equations governing action play probabilities, which turn out to have qualitative features of mutator-selection equations. We then perform agent-based simulations to find the conditions where the deterministic approximation is closest to the original stochastic learning process for standard 2-action 2-player fluctuating games, where interaction between learning rules and preference reversal may occur. Finally, we analyze a simplified model for the evolution of learning in a producer–scrounger game, which shows that the exploration rate can interact in a non-intuitive way with other features of co-evolving learning rules. Overall, our analyses illustrate the usefulness of applying stochastic approximation theory in the study of animal learning. "

In our model, the fitness of players is determined by the payoffs from the current interactions and their history. Based on extensive simulations, we find that the density of cooperators is enhanced by increasing the heritability of players over a wide range of the multiplication factor. We attribute the enhancement of cooperation to the inherited fitness that stabilizes the fitness of players, and thus prevents the expansion of defectors effectively. "

The proposed approach provides an approximation to the rational reaction set (RRS) for each player. An intersection of these sets yields the Nash solution for the game. An alternate approach for generating the \{RRS\} based on design of experiments (DOE) combined with response surface methodology (RSM) is also explored. The two approaches for generating the \{RRS\} are compared on three example problems to find Nash and Stackelberg solutions. For the examples presented, it is seen that the proposed sensitivity based approach (i) requires less computational effort than a RSM-DOE approach, (ii) is less prone to numerical errors than the RSM-DOE approach, (iii) has the ability to find multiple Nash solutions when the Nash solution is not a singleton, (iv) is able to approximate nonlinear RRS, and (v) on one example problem, found a Nash solution better than the one reported in the literature.

We develop a price competition model of two green and regular supply chains under the influences of government financial intervention. The supply chains that each consists of one manufacturer and one retailer provide different types of a product which are partially substitutable in market. We formulate the problem as a game theoretical model in the form of six scenarios based on government tendencies and decision-making structures of supply chains. We analyze the effects of government’s tariffs on the players’ optimal strategies and we find that there are specific boundaries for tariffs which guarantee stable competitive market. Numerical results reveal that the environmental protection and social responsibility tendencies of the government have measurable impacts on the government’s revenue as well as supply chains’ and their members’ profits.

For games of identical interests, every limit point of the sequence of mixed strategies induced by the empirical frequencies of best response actions that players in \{SFP\} play is a Nash equilibrium. Because discrete optimization problems can be viewed as games of identical interests wherein Nash equilibria define a type of local optimum, \{SFP\} has recently been employed as a heuristic optimization algorithm with promising empirical performance. However, there have been no guarantees of convergence to a globally optimal Nash equilibrium established for any of the problem classes considered to date. In this paper, we introduce a variant of \{SFP\} and show that it converges almost surely to optimal policies in model-free, finite-horizon stochastic dynamic programs. The key idea is to view the dynamic programming states as players, whose common interest is to maximize the total multi-period expected reward starting in a fixed initial state. We also offer empirical results suggesting that our \{SFP\} variant is effective in practice for small to moderate sized model-free problems. "

By means of game theory, four different relationships between the channel members are considered: Firstly, three non-cooperative games with either symmetrical distribution of power or asymmetrical distribution with one player being the leader in each case, and one cooperative game where both players tend to maximize the total profit. The latter is complemented by a bargaining model, which proposes a fair split of profit on the basis of the players’ risk attitude and bargaining power. Our main findings are as follows: (a) In contrast to previous analyses, we do not limit the ratio between manufacturer’s and retailer’s margin, which provides more general insights into the effects of the underlying distribution of power within the channel. (b) The highest total profit is gained when both players cooperate. This behavior puts also the customers in a better position, as it produces the lowest retail price as well as the highest advertising expenditures compared to the other configurations. "

Without short-sale constraints there is a non-revealing equilibrium but no revealing equilibrium. "

Furthermore, the language of every p-automaton is closed under probabilistic bisimulation. Similar to tree automata, whose acceptance is defined via two-player games, we define acceptance of Markov chains by p-automata through two-player stochastic games. We show that acceptance is solvable in EXPTIME; but for automata that arise from \{PCTL\} formulas acceptance matches that of \{PCTL\} model checking, namely, linear in the formula and polynomial in the Markov chain. We also derive a notion of simulation between p-automata that approximates language containment in \{EXPTIME\} and is complete for Markov chains. These foundations therefore enable abstraction-based probabilistic model checking for probabilistic specifications that subsume Markov chains, and \{LTL\} and CTL* like logics. "

Furthermore, this program is seen to provide a unifying framework for representing the core, the least core, and the (fuzzy) nucleolus, among others. Next, we derive conditions for uniqueness of core rewards and to deal with non-uniqueness we introduce a family of parametric perturbations of the convex program that encompasses a large number of well-known concepts for selection from the core, including the Dutta–Ray solution (Dutta and Ray, 1989), the equal sacrifice solution (Yu, 1973), the equal division solution (Selten, 1972) and the tau-value (Tijs, 1981). We also generalize the concept of the Grand Coalition of contracting players by allowing for multiple technologies, and we specify the conditions for this allocation to be unique and Egalitarian. Finally, we show that our formulation offers a natural extension to existing models of production economies with threats and division rules for common surplus. "

The sample consisted of 340 college soccer players of both genders (178 female and 162 male), representing 17 different teams (8 female and 9 male) ranked in the top-32 of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA). Methods Numerous demographic and soccer-related variables represented level-1 in the \{HLM\} model. Group Environment Questionnaire and Team Assessment Diagnostic Measure were entered as level-2 variables, representing cohesion and team mental models, respectively. Perceived performance potential (PPP) served as the dependent variable. Objective performance scores were correlated with PPP, attesting a moderate to high-level of criterion related validity (r = .78). Results The final model suggested that: (a) International athletes perceive their performance lower than others, (b) different field positions share different covariance coefficients with PPP, and (c) perception of social cohesion from a group, rather than individual, standpoint is positively associated with perceptions of team performance. Conclusions High performing teams have clearly defined task-related and team-related goals. Accordingly, social rather than task related factors may represent a competitive edge, further energizing the interactions and performance of top-ranked teams. International athletes perceive team performance lower than locals, perhaps due to differences in preferred game-style and acculturation experiences. Players from different field positions (i.e., goalkeepers, defensive, and offensive players) relate differently to team performance in college soccer. "

The surplus is modeled by a regime-switching jump diffusion process. A single payoff function is imposed, and one player devises an optimal strategy to maximize the expected payoff function, whereas the other player is trying to minimize the same quantity. Using dynamic programming principle, the upper and lower values of the game satisfy a coupled system of nonlinear integro-differential Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs (HJI) equations. Moreover, the existence of the saddle point for this game problem is verified. Because of the jumps and regime-switching, closed-form solutions are virtually impossible to obtain. Our effort is devoted to designing numerical methods. We use Markov chain approximation techniques to construct a discrete-time controlled Markov chain to approximate the value functions and optimal controls. Convergence of the approximation algorithms is proved. Examples are presented to illustrate the applicability of the numerical methods. "

This paper aims to propose a dynamic spectrum market model where each spectrum holder has a limited amount of spectrum and is allowed to enter a portion of its available bandwidth into the market managed by a spectrum broker, besides its primary services. To model the price dynamics, a continuous-time price adjustment process governed by a differential equation is considered. Subsequently, we show that the problem is a dynamic N-player oligopoly differential game, subject to the bandwidth constraint. We analyze the feedback Nash equilibrium (NE) solutions for the general game and provide a complete, closed-form solution for the special symmetric case. The solution can be characterized into three distinct regions and transitions between these regions may occur as time evolves, which will be thoroughly investigated. In addition, we propose a discrete-time price adjustment implemented at the spectrum broker. Extensive numerical studies are provided to investigate various aspects of the proposed competition. "

These costs can be reduced by pooling common spare parts between multiple companies in the same region, but managers may be unsure about how to share the resulting costs or benefits in a fair way that avoids free riders. To tackle this problem, we study several players, each facing a Poisson demand process for an expensive, low-usage item. They share a stock point that is controlled by a continuous-review base stock policy with full backordering under an optimal base stock level. Costs consist of penalty costs for backorders and holding costs for on-hand stock. We propose to allocate the total costs proportional to players’ demand rates. Our key result is that this cost allocation rule satisfies many appealing properties: it makes all separate participants and subgroups of participants better off, it stimulates growth of the pool, it can be easily implemented in practice, and it induces players to reveal their private information truthfully. To obtain these game theoretical results, we exploit novel structural properties of the cost function in our (S − 1, S) inventory model. "

Examining players’ best responses, the solution of the game follows by locating all the Nash Equilibria (NE). We extend the \{NE\} notion to the logit Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE), to capture players’ bounded rationality and model insider’s behavior. The \{QRE\} results are more realistic, and show that the solution of the game might be significantly different than the corresponding \{NE\} solution. Thus, we determine how an insider will interact in the future, and how an \{IDS\} will react to protect the system. To easily exploit \{QRE\} results in ID, we propose the use of a detection mechanism.

In this way, players are able to adapt and learn from each other’s strategies as the game progresses without being able to rationalise good strategies. We characterise all steady states of the \{ESPD\} for the case where G is a path, and we also characterise the structures of those initial states that lead to the emergence of persistent substates of cooperation over time. We finally determine analytically (i.e. without using simulation) the probability that the game’s states will evolve from a randomly generated initial state towards a steady state which accommodates some form of persistent cooperation. More specifically, we show that there exists a range of game parameters for which the likelihood of the emergence of persistent cooperation increases to almost certainty as the length of the path increases.

Our non-cooperative game theoretic model shows that a unique subgame perfect Nash equilibrium exists that facilitates development of structural results characterizing network stability from the perspectives of costs, number of players and parameters of the coordination mechanism. In particular, we obtain ranges for cost, number of players and the profit sharing parameter over which the network is internally and/or externally stable.

We then proceed to the computation of stable coalitions using time-consistent harvest-sharing policies for the partial coordination scheme, in the case where players are divided into two groups (high and low discount rates). We find that asymmetry has a significant impact on the way the resource is shared and on the profitability of coalitions. We also find that asymmetry is not a sufficient feature to overcome the puzzle of small coalitions. "

The entirety of collaborative replenishment (ECR) includes one supplier, one retailer and one consumer. The two players join in the non-cooperative game. Both of them pursue their own ideal benefits and achieve the equilibrium in terms of food quantity and price. A new iterative algorithm based on the theory of fixed point is designed to improve the equilibrium model. A numeric example was set to identify the applicability of the model. The parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the overall profit of \{ECR\} will increase with consumers’ demand, while the customer satisfaction will decrease to some extent when the food deterioration rate and shortage cost increase, the overall profit of \{ECR\} will decrease. We find that the former leads to decreasing of the customer satisfactory and the latter do the opposite. Appropriate strategies should be chosen based on the actual situation for each equilibrium subject. "

By introducing rational communication participants, we model the secure communication process in the manner of game theory to capture the interactions of distrusted communication parties. More specifically, we propose a formal framework to provide a precise description of the computation and communication rules in a secure communication game. Each player tends to behave in a way that maximizes their profits in this framework. Following the framework, the fairness of a protocol is presented according to Nash equilibrium of the communication game, as well as the equivalence condition towards a fair protocol. To verify the effectiveness of this framework, we design and implement a series of experiments. The experimental results show that our rational framework is more secure and closer to the practice compared with traditional cryptographic models, which can be a promising analysis solution for future cryptographic protocols.

This article develops a game-theoretical model to deal with the protection of facilities, in the context of the uncapacitated fixed-charge location problem. Given a set of investment alternatives for protecting the facilities against identified threats, the objective is to select the optimal defence strategy. The attacker is considered as a player who tries to maximise the expected damage while weighing against the attacks expenditures. The conflict on facilities vulnerability is modelled using the concept of contest. The vulnerability of a facility is defined by its destruction probability. Contest success functions determine the vulnerability of each facility dependent on the relative investments of the defender and the attacker on each facility, and on the characteristics of the contest. A method is developed to evaluate the utilities of the players (i.e., the defender and the attacker). This method evaluates many expected costs, including the cost needed to restore disabled facilities, the backorder cost, and the cost incurred because of the increase in transportation costs after attacks. In fact, when one or several facilities are unavailable, transportation costs will increase since reassigned customers may receive shipments from facilities which are farther away. The model considers a non-cooperative two-period game between the players, and an algorithm is presented to determine the equilibrium solution and the optimal defence strategy. An illustrative example is presented. The approach is compared to other suggested strategies, and some managerial insights are provided in the context of facility location. "

When the smuggling coincides with the patrol, there occurs one of three events: the capture of the smuggler by Customs, a success of the smuggling and nothing new. If the smuggler is captured or no time remains to complete the game, the game ends. There have been many studies on the inspection game so far by the multi-stage game model, where both players at a stage know players’ strategies taken at the previous stage. In this paper, we consider a two-person zero-sum single-shot game, where the game proceeds through multiple periods but both players do not know any strategies taken by their opponents on the process of the game.

Thus, the identification of the significant indices characterizing a situation is essentially based on the perception selectiveness. This study aims at organizing the information specific to a game action within a perceptual model including data about the situational framework in which it takes place. To perceive only what is important in a game situation is an extremely complex process, which can be improved through a perceptual and motor-perceptual learning program. By means of this program, the athlete learns what to perceive, relying on the information organization under the form of perceptual models. The research consisted of a pedagogic experiment that aimed at modeling the preparation of some actions, by using the perceptual models. They show an improvement of the game efficiency in the indicators that will be detailed in our full paper. The study proves that the learning program focused on the perceptual models leads to an improvement both of the perception and of the game. This program can also be extended to the utilization of perceptual models for the preparation of the other game actions. "

Results confirm that the bullwhip effect arises in all experimental treatments and that the variance of orders is higher under stochastic lead times. Analysis of players' behaviour in the course of the game suggests that players react to higher uncertainty by holding fewer inventories, a behaviour consistent with the predictions of some psychological models of choice under ambiguity.

A pair of threshold values determines the uncertainty levels in these regions. A critical issue in the community is the determination of optimal values of these thresholds. This problem may be investigated by considering a possible relationship between changes in probabilistic thresholds and their impacts on uncertainty levels of different regions. We investigate the use of game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model in exploring such a relationship. A threshold configuration mechanism is defined with the \{GTRS\} model in order to minimize the overall uncertainty level of rough set based classification. By realizing probabilistic regions as players in a game, a mechanism is introduced that repeatedly tunes the parameters in order to calculate effective threshold parameter values. Experimental results on text categorization suggest that the overall uncertainty of probabilistic regions may be reduced with the threshold configuration mechanism. "

Fictitious play is another learning model used extensively in learning theory to better understand reinforcement-type learning algorithms. Logit or Bolztmann-Gibbs learning has a distribution of actions or strategies that are updated according to a formula. Games can also have a cost of learning, in which a player incurs a cost if he changes his action, and finally, the Nash bargaining solution shows how learning algorithms can be used to obtain efficient solutions.

Our solution differs from Wilson’s concept because the measurability of strategies in our solution is postponed until the consumption date (assumed with respect to the information that will be known by the players at the consumption date). For interim consumption, our concept differs from Yannelis’s private core because players can negotiate conditional on proper common knowledge events in our solution, which strengthens the interim aspect of the game, as we will illustrate with examples.

However, we find evidence that commitment may also increase the number of failed agreements and reduce overall efficiency from exchange. To explain why behavior is inconsistent with standard game-theoretic predictions, we offer a behavioral bargaining model that allows for both “sincere” and “strategic” responders. Strategic responders behave as expected-payoff maximizers, while sincere responders behave according to a minimum-acceptable-offer (MAO) rule. We demonstrate that a mix of sincere and strategic types in the population is necessary to generate increasing equilibrium offers over time and “holdout” behavior, whereby strategic responders wait for higher offers in later periods. In response, proposers may find it optimal to commit early to an offer if commitment is possible. "

Primary users have a license to operate in a certain spectrum band; their access can only be controlled by the primary operator and is not affected by any other unlicensed (secondary) user. On the other hand, secondary users (SUs) have no spectrum license, and they attempt to exploit the spectral gaps left free by primary users. This work studies the spectrum access problem in cognitive radio networks from a game theoretical perspective. The problem is modeled as a non-cooperative spectrum access game where secondary users access simultaneously multiple spectrum bands left available by primary users, optimizing their objective function which takes into account the congestion level observed on the available spectrum bands. As a key innovative feature with respect to existing works, we model accurately the interference between SUs, capturing the effect of spatial reuse. Furthermore, we consider both non-elastic and elastic user traffic, to model real-time as well as data transfer applications. Finally, we consider an alternative formulation of the spectrum access problem, where players use replicator dynamics to adjust their strategies, and we derive convergence conditions to Nash equilibrium points. We demonstrate the existence of the Nash equilibrium, and derive equilibrium flow settings. Finally, we provide numerical results of the proposed spectrum access game in several cognitive radio scenarios, and study the impact of the interference between \{SUs\} on the game efficiency. Our results indicate that the congestion cost functions we propose in this paper lead to small gaps between Nash equilibria and optimal solutions in all the considered network scenarios, thus representing a starting point for designing pricing mechanisms so as to obtain a socially optimal use of the network.

When the risk (variance) of the consumer's valuation increases, the manufacturer may raise the unit wholesale price to achieve a higher unit profit. The supply chain is better off using full refund policy if the risk is very small; otherwise, the supply chain prefers no returns policy. The results of this paper are robust to distribution form. "

Furthermore, varying the quantity of information available to the players (modeled by changing the degree of uncertainty) provided additional insight into the players’ propensity to engage in corrupt behavior. The experimental results show that a higher degree of uncertainty in the informational setting reduces corruption. "

The second part of the paper reports on an experiment testing this game. On average, 88.5% of the proposers understate the actual endowment by 20.5%. Regression analysis shows that a 1-euro gap between the actual and declared amounts prompts proposers to reduce their offer by 19 cents on average. However, responders’ decision to accept/reject the offer does not depend on the message. It results a net welfare loss specific to such a “free-to-lie” environment. "

The sanction system is itself a public good and can cause problematic “second-order free riders” who do not contribute to the provisions of the sanctions and thus may subvert the cooperation supported by sanctioning. Recent studies have shown that public goods games with punishment can lead to a coercion-based regime if participation in the game is optional. Here, we reveal that even with compulsory participation, rewards can maintain cooperation within an infinitely large population. We consider three strategies for players in a standard public goods game: to be a cooperator or a defector in a standard public goods game, or to be a rewarder who contributes to the public good and to a fund that rewards players who contribute during the game. Cooperators do not contribute to the reward fund and are therefore classified as second-order free riders. The replicator dynamics for the three strategies exhibit a rock–scissors–paper cycle, and can be analyzed fully, despite the fact that the expected payoffs are nonlinear. The model does not require repeated interaction, spatial structure, group selection, or reputation. We also discuss a simple method for second-order sanctions, which can lead to a globally stable state where 100% of the population are rewarders. "

Stackelberg games are natural models for many important applications that involve human interaction, such as oligopolistic markets and security domains. In Stackelberg games, one player, the leader, commits to a strategy and the follower makes her decision with knowledge of the leader's commitment. Existing algorithms for Stackelberg games efficiently find optimal solutions (leader strategy), but they critically assume that the follower plays optimally. Unfortunately, in many applications, agents face human followers (adversaries) who — because of their bounded rationality and limited observation of the leader strategy — may deviate from their expected optimal response. In other words, human adversaries' decisions are biased due to their bounded rationality and limited observations. Not taking into account these likely deviations when dealing with human adversaries may cause an unacceptable degradation in the leader's reward, particularly in security applications where these algorithms have seen deployment. The objective of this paper therefore is to investigate how to build algorithms for agent interactions with human adversaries. To address this crucial problem, this paper introduces a new mixed-integer linear program (MILP) for Stackelberg games to consider human adversaries, incorporating: (i) novel anchoring theories on human perception of probability distributions and (ii) robustness approaches for \{MILPs\} to address human imprecision. Since this new approach considers human adversaries, traditional proofs of correctness or optimality are insufficient; instead, it is necessary to rely on empirical validation. To that end, this paper considers four settings based on real deployed security systems at Los Angeles International Airport (Pita et al., 2008 [35]), and compares 6 different approaches (three based on our new approach and three previous approaches), in 4 different observability conditions, involving 218 human subjects playing 2960 games in total. The final conclusion is that a model which incorporates both the ideas of robustness and anchoring achieves statistically significant higher rewards and also maintains equivalent or faster solution speeds compared to existing approaches.

Existing literature investigates payoffs and optimal strategies for both parties, in order to provide the defender with an optimal defence strategy. In this paper, we model a \{DDoS\} attack as a one-shot, non-cooperative, zero-sum game. We extend previous work by incorporating in our model a richer set of options available to the attacker compared to what has been previously achieved. We investigate multiple permutations in terms of the cost to perform an attack, the number of attacking nodes, malicious traffic probability distributions and their parameters. We analytically demonstrate that there exists a single optimal strategy available to the defender. By adopting it, the defender sets an upper boundary to attacker payoff, which can only be achieved if the attacker is a rational player. For all other attack strategies (those adopted by irrational attackers), attacker payoff will be lower than this boundary. We preliminary validate this model via simulations with the ns2 network simulator. The simulated environment replicates the analytical model's parameters and the results confirm our model's accuracy.

In this paper, we address a discrete competitive location game in which two decision-makers have to decide simultaneously where to locate their services without knowing the decisions of one another. This problem arises in a franchising environment in which the decision-makers are the franchisees and the franchiser defines the potential sites for locating services and the rules of the game. At most one service can be located at each site, and one of the franchisees has preferential rights over the other. This means that if both franchisees are interested in opening the service in the same site, only the one that has preferential rights will open it. We consider that both franchisees have budget constraints, but the franchisee without preferential rights is allowed to show interest in more sites than the ones she can afford. We are interested in studying the influence of the existence of preferential rights and overbidding on the outcomes for both franchisees and franchiser. A model is presented and an algorithmic approach is developed for the calculation of Nash equilibria. Several computational experiments are defined and their results are analysed, showing that preferential rights give its holder a relative advantage over the other competitor. The possibility of overbidding seems to be advantageous for the franchiser, as well as the inclusion of some level of asymmetry between the two decision-makers. "

At equilibrium, he accepts a female if the utility from mating exceeds the expected utility from future search, which depends on the acceptance strategies of all males and females and the corresponding steady-state distribution of age in the pool of unmated individuals. Females face an analogous problem. Mating pairs are only formed by mutual consent and individuals leave the pool of unmated individuals on finding a mating partner or reaching the age of 1. A policy iteration algorithm is used to determine the equilibrium acceptance strategies and the corresponding steady-state distribution of the age of individuals in the mating pool.

The results show that a U-shaped investment–uncertainty relationship generally sustains even for infinite-lived investment projects and proper defined cash flows. However, timing of an investment occurs inefficiently late. Moreover, we show that the influence of uncertainty on the associated first-mover advantage becomes ambiguous, too. "

We find that dictators transfer less when there are more dictators, and recipients earn less when there are multiple dictators. This effect persisted despite mechanisms eliminating uncertainty about other dictators’ behavior (a strategy method and communication). In a typical public goods game, people seem to transform the situation into an assurance game, willing to contribute if certain others will too. Despite similarities, people do not treat a recipient’s welfare like a public good. Instead, people seem to transform the situation into a prisoner’s dilemma, refusing to help whatever others do. "

The objective is to find a distributed solution that maximizes the network utility, defined with different criteria, with limited information. The problem is addressed through a non-cooperative game based on local information. Although the existence of a pure Nash Equilibrium cannot be assured for this game, simulation results show that it exists with high probability and with a performance similar to that of a potential game, where each player requires overall network information. The obtained results are compared with a centralized heuristic genetic algorithm to show the correctness of the proposals. From this point, utility functions for the local game are modified to restrict the transmitted power to drive the solution to a more cooperative approach. To overcome the convergence limitations of the local game, no-regret learning algorithms are used to perform the joint channel and power allocation. These algorithms provide stable mixed strategies in any scenario with even better global performance. This opens an interesting perspective to develop realistic protocols based on the modeled interactions and increases the adaptability to perform efficient opportunistic spectrum access. "

In the present study, we proposed that the online game players’ physical and social proximity as well as their mutual familiarity influence bridging and bonding social capital. Physical proximity was predicted to positively influence bonding social capital online. Social proximity and familiarity were hypothesized to foster both online bridging and bonding social capital. Additionally, we hypothesized that both social capital dimensions are positively related to offline social support. The hypotheses were tested with regard to members of e-sports clans. In an online survey, participants (N = 811) were recruited via the online portal of the Electronic Sports League (ESL) in several countries.

In such situations, the set of players of which each player knows the chosen strategy can be modeled by means of a social knowledge graph in which nodes represent players and there is an edge from i to j if i knows j . Following the framework introduced in [7], we study the impact of social knowledge graphs on the fundamental multicast cost sharing game in which all the players want to receive the same communication from a given source in an undirected network. In the classical complete information case, such a game is known to be highly inefficient, since its price of anarchy can be as high as the total number of players ρ . We first show that, under our incomplete information setting, pure Nash equilibria always exist only if the social knowledge graph is directed acyclic (DAG). We then prove that the price of stability of any \{DAG\} is at least 1 2 log ρ and provide a \{DAG\} lowering the classical price of anarchy to a value between 1 2 log ρ and log 2 ρ . If specific instances of the game are concerned, that is if the social knowledge graph can be selected as a function of the instance, we show that the price of stability is at least 4 ρ ρ + 3 , and that the same bound holds also for the price of anarchy of any social knowledge graph (not only DAGs). Moreover, we provide a nearly matching upper bound by proving that, for any fixed instance, there always exists a \{DAG\} yielding a price of anarchy less than 4 .

abstract = "Abstract We address the cooperation problem in structured populations by considering the prisoner’s dilemma game as a metaphor of the social interactions between individuals with imitation capacity. We present a new strategy update rule called democratic weighted update where the individual’s behavior is socially influenced by each one of their neighbors. In particular, the capacity of an individual to socially influence other ones is proportional to its accumulated payoff. When in a neighborhood there are cooperators and defectors, the focal player is contradictorily influenced by them and, therefore, the effective social influence is given by the difference of the accumulated payoff of each strategy in its neighborhood. First, by considering the growing process of the network and neglecting mutations, we show the evolution of highly cooperative systems. Then, we broadly show that the social influence allows to overcome the emergence of defectors into highly cooperative systems. In this way, we conclude that in a structured system formed by a growing process, the cooperation evolves if the individuals have an imitation capacity socially influenced by each one of their neighbors. Therefore, here we present a theoretical solution of the cooperation problem among genetically unrelated individuals. "

Such properties are expressible in probabilistic temporal logics, e.g. PCTL, and efficient algorithms exist for checking whether these formulae are true or false on finite-state models. Alas, these algorithms do not supply diagnostic information for why a probabilistic property does or does not hold in a given model. We provide here complete and rigorous foundations for such diagnostics in the setting of countable labeled Markov chains and PCTL. For each model and \{PCTL\} formula, we define a game between a Verifier and a Refuter that is won by Verifier if the formula holds in the model, and won by Refuter if it does not hold. Games are won by exactly one player, through monotone strategies that encode the diagnostic information for truth and falsity (respectively). These games are infinite with Büchi type acceptance conditions where simpler fairness conditions are shown to be not sufficient. Verifier can always force finite plays for certain \{PCTL\} formulae, suggesting the existence of finite-state abstractions of models that satisfy such formulae. "

Here we consider behavior in one such social dilemma, the Traveler's Dilemma, that has received considerable attention in the economics literature but is little known among theoretical biologists. The rules of the game are as follows. Two players each choose a value between R and M, where 0 &lt; R &lt; M . If the players choose the same value, both receive that amount. If the players choose different values v1 and v2, where v 1 &lt; v 2 , then the player choosing v1 receives v 1 + R and the player choosing v2 receives v 1 − R . While the players would maximize their payoffs by both choosing the largest allowed value, M, the Nash equilibrium is to choose the smallest allowed value, R. In behavioral experiments, however, people generally choose values much larger than the minimum and the deviation from the expected equilibrium decreases with R. In this paper, we show that the cooperative behavior observed in the Traveler's Dilemma can be explained in an evolutionary framework. We study stochastic evolutionary dynamics in finite populations with varying intensity of selection and varying mutation rate. We derive analytic results showing that strategies choosing high values can be favored when selection is weak. More generally, selection favors strategies that choose high values if R is small (relative to M) and strategies that choose low values if R is large. Finally, we show that a two-parameter model involving the intensity of selection and the mutation rate can quantitatively reproduce data that from a Traveler's Dilemma experiment. These results demonstrate the power of evolutionary game theory for explaining human behavior in contexts that are challenging for standard economic game theory. "

Our results show that the number of strategies increases with the weight parameter α for the low multiplication factor r . On the contrary, for the high multiplication factor r , the less cautious cooperators are more likely to appear in the system. "

A hybrid system is a system mixing continuous and discrete behaviours that cannot be faithfully modelled neither by using a formalism with continuous dynamics only nor by a formalism including only discrete dynamics. We model hybrid systems as Hybrid Automata and add distinguished actions to describe faults. We define a Fault Identification Game on them, using two players: the environment and the identifier. The environment controls the evolution of the system and chooses whether and when a fault occurs. The identifier observes the external behaviour of the system and announces whether a fault has occurred or not. Existence of a winning strategy for the identifier implies that faults can be detected correctly, while computing such a winning strategy corresponds to implementing an identifier for the system. We will show how to determine the existence of a winning strategy, and how to compute it, for all decidable classes of hybrid automata that admit a finite bisimulation quotient. "

In particular, specific mathematical criteria are presented for categorizing solution concepts which can be used for predicting equilibria in n-player games. One of the criteria on which this taxonomy of solution concepts is based is the number of steps ahead a player may think, in terms of the reactions of other players to his actions. Other criteria include which players take part in the sanctioning process, and whether sanctioning moves are restricted to those which lead to immediate improvements for the mover. In order to demonstrate the insight which decision makers can gain from studying a dispute using the graph model, various solution concepts are applied to an important environmental engineering problem.

Existing implementations work at the model level, limiting their scalability. In this paper, we develop language-level abstraction techniques that build game-based abstractions of \{MDPs\} directly from high-level descriptions in the \{PRISM\} modelling language, using predicate abstraction and \{SMT\} solvers. For efficiency, we develop a compositional framework for abstraction. We have applied our techniques to a range of case studies, successfully verifying models larger than was possible with existing implementations. We are also able to demonstrate the benefits of adopting a compositional approach. "

In each case, the sufficient condition to find the region that belongs to the basin of attraction is derived using some discrete-time converse Lyapunov theorems.

We propose an extension of a fuzzy game with fuzzy coalitions and vague expectations together and obtain some interesting properties. It has been observed that most of the properties satisfied by a crisp game hold good in the fuzzy sense in this extension. A practical application of the proposed model in Investment Theory is being provided. Further, a Shapley function in the fuzzy sense has been proposed as a solution concept to this class of games. The notion of a fuzzy population monotonic allocation function (FPMAF) is defined and established that the proposed Shapley function is an \{FPMAF\} also. "

Consequently, the service providers (SP) armed with different wireless technologies (like 2.5G/3G/LTE) would require an adequate and significant amount of spectrum bandwidth for satisfying the need of their customers. Hence to achieve complete commercialization, the SPs, operating simultaneously, would demand for more and more spectrum from the regulatory body of the country. The spectrum demand on the part of the \{SP\} may vary with time (dynamic) because of varied kind of loads which are generated depending on the nature of the client-base, their requirements and their expected quality of experience. This work has addressed this challenging issue of allocating spectrum dynamically to different technologies under the portfolio of an SP. Here, we have conceived a scenario where service providers (SP) own multiple access networks (ANs) of different technologies. We envisage that an entity, called local spectrum controller (LSC) which is dedicated for managing the common pool of spectrum allocated to each SP. \{LSC\} is mainly responsible for distributing the spectrum to individual \{ANs\} of an \{SP\} in a fair manner. Since the available spectrum may not be sufficient enough to satisfy the aggregate demand from all \{ANs\} simultaneously, an \{LSC\} may face a situation, where satisfying individual demands from all \{ANs\} may result in a compromise between the demand and supply. This demand–supply situation would force an \{LSC\} or an \{SP\} to adhere to some dynamic spectrum management strategy, where demands of an \{AN\} would have to be satisfied depending on the current state of available spectrum and required usage of it. This calls for an adaptive dynamic strategy to be introduced by an \{SP\} for efficient spectrum distribution. The dynamic disparity of spectrum allocation can be idealized as a game between \{LSC\} and ANs. Hence, in the present work, we have modeled the problem of dynamic spectrum allocation as an n-player cooperative bankruptcy game and have solved the problem with the help of Shapley value and τ-value separately. We have investigated whether the \{ANs\} find it beneficial to cooperate with each other to make the solution sustainable enough. To evaluate the performances of the games that the \{ANs\} play, we have designed a novel utility function for each AN. We have identified plausible aims of an \{SP\} as minimizing overall dissatisfaction (MOD) and maximizing equality of distribution (MED). Next, we have studied performances of the above two solution concepts against max–min fairness algorithm (benchmarked in our case) with respect to the above objectives of LSC. Finally, we have proposed a unique heuristic in order to facilitate the decision making process of dynamic spectrum allocation, which leads to an adaptive yet optimized spectrum allocation strategy.

Our analysis suggests that governments are unlikely to ultimately benefit from reducing their decommission liabilities at the expense of International Oil Companies. In countries with unstable tax regimes, such as the UK, International Oil Companies will adopt their strategies in anticipation of future tax changes. Their adopted strategy is a function of decommissioning liabilities and remaining reserves as well as whether they are producers, shippers or producers and shippers. The ultimate payoff of a government is a function of the remaining reserves and total decommissioning liabilities, but also depends on the distribution of these value metrics between producers and shippers.

Here, we consider a scenario where multiple access networks (ANs) of different (not necessarily competing) technologies are owned by a single SP. We envisage that an \{SP\} employs an entity, called local spectrum controller (LSC), which manages a common pool of spectrum and is responsible for distributing the spectrum to individual \{ANs\} in a fair manner. Since the available spectrum is inadequate to satisfy the aggregate demand from all \{ANs\} simultaneously, \{LSC\} has to employ a dynamic spectrum allocation strategy. We have modeled the problem as an n-player cooperative bargaining game and have solved the problem with the help of solution techniques namely, Nash bargaining solution (NBS), Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution (KSBS) and modified Thomson bargaining solution (MTBS). We have presented two novel heuristics to compute \{KSBS\} and MTBS. Moreover, a suitable utility function for the \{AN\} with respect to its received spectrum have been presented. We have also identified possible objectives of \{LSC\} (i.e., SP), namely minimizing overall dissatisfaction (MOD) of heterogeneous network, maintaining equality of distribution (MED) and maximizing proportional fairness (MPF). Finally, we have compared performances of above solutions with max–min fairness solution and Shapley value solution with respect to the above objectives of LSC. "

The demand for the legal (non-pirated) product, which depends on both price and monetary investment in protection, is assumed to be uncertain. Three different supply chain models are analyzed: manufacturer Stackelberg, retailer Stackelberg and vertical integration. We show that the retailer׳s utility function has no effect on the equilibrium strategies, and suggest schemes to find these strategies for any utility function of the manufacturer. Further results are obtained under assumptions of either a multiplicative or an additive demand model. We study the players׳ strategies under different profit criteria reflecting different attitudes toward risk—specifically, the Expectation criterion and the Target criterion—and, for each criterion, we obtain the dependence between the pricing and the protection investment. We show that there are situations in which the manufacturer can increase his profit by giving up his leadership to the retailer, even if the power balance is in his favor. "

In particular, we focus our attention on three players: a large speculative bank (hereinafter called Speculator), having immediate access to the market of government bonds, the European Central Bank (ECB) and a State in economic crisis, with a high public debt. In this regard, we will analyze the interaction between these three subjects: the Speculator, our first player, the ECB, our second player, and the State, our third player. The financial crisis, that hit the market of European government bonds, showed us that large speculators can influence the financial markets and benefit from the creation of arbitrage opportunities caused by themselves. In this way, the default probability of States in economic difficulty increases significantly and alarmingly. We already heard to talk about concepts like “spread” and “public debt,” which has crippled the economies of great States, for instance Italy. In this paper we propose on financial transactions the introduction of a tax, which hits only the speculative profits. We show how the above tax would probably be able to avert the speculation. For this purpose, we compare the different behaviors adopted by the Speculator and by the \{ECB\} in case of absence or presence of the tax, with the consequent effects on the State that sells its government bonds, paying particular attention to the movement of the game equilibria. In fact, with the introduction of our tax, all equilibria of the game become excellent for the State in economic difficulty. "

(2) The \{SPE\} does not need to be unique, in particular, there is no unique \{SPE\} with sequential moves if the direct costs of effort are zero.

All simple directed cycles of this digraph together with its terminal positions form the set A of the outcomes. Each non-terminal position j is controlled by one of two players i ∈ I = { 1 , 2 } . A strategy x i of a player i ∈ I involves selecting a move ( j , j ′ ) in each position j controlled by i . We restrict both players to their pure positional strategies; in other words, a move ( j , j ′ ) in a position j is deterministic (not random) and it can depend only on j (not on preceding positions or moves or on their numbers). For every pair of strategies ( x 1 , x 2 ) , the selected moves uniquely define a play, that is, a directed path form a given initial position j 0 to an outcome (a directed cycle or terminal vertex). This outcome a ∈ A is the result of the game corresponding to the chosen strategies, a = a ( x 1 , x 2 ) . Furthermore, each player i ∈ I = { 1 , 2 } has a real-valued utility function u i over A . Standardly, a game form g is called Nash-solvable if for every u = ( u 1 , u 2 ) the obtained game ( g , u ) has a Nash equilibrium (in pure positional strategies). A digraph (and the corresponding game form) is called symmetric if ( j , j ′ ) is its arc whenever ( j ′ , j ) is. In this paper we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for Nash-solvability of symmetric cycle two-person game forms and show that these conditions can be verified in linear time in the size of the digraph.

Their products are substitutable and have random demands. Therefore, multiple direction demand transfers occur when one or more retailers are sold out. It is shown that, by using Nash equilibrium, optimal decision exists for each retailer when they work independently. The optimal order quantity in this case is larger than that under the newsboy problem model. This is because substitution can be a source of sales and hence a justification for inventory. In situations where some retailer may act irrationally to inflict a damage on the others, the defensive strategy for the latter is to totally ignore the existence of the irrational player. We also study the cooperation of retailers by switching excess inventory to those who have excess demand both when side payments are and are not allowed. If side payments are not allowed, secure (Nash) strategies always exist for each retailer and cooperation will reduce inventory. The latter is especially true when the depreciation of value of the item and/or inventory carrying cost are large. We give conditions for cooperation in both cases and show that although all-player cooperation is often feasible it may not always be obtainable even if side payments are allowed. "

We find that as consumers’ environmental awareness increases, retailers and manufacturers with superior eco-friendly operations will benefit; while the profitability of the inferior eco-friendly firm will tend to increase if the production competition level is low, and will tend to decrease if the production competition level is high. In addition, higher levels of retail competition may make manufacturers with inferior eco-friendly operations more likely to benefit from the increase of consumers’ environmental awareness. Moreover, as production competition intensifies, the profits of the retailers will always increase, while the profits of the manufacturers with inferior eco-friendly operations will always decrease. The profitability of the manufacturers with superior eco-friendly operations will also tend to decrease, unless consumers’ environmental awareness is high and the superior manufacturer has a significant cost advantage related to product environmental improvement.

It could be comprised of reusing, refurbishing, remanufacturing, and recycling activities. In this paper, we revisit the issue of revenue sharing in reverse supply chains to formulate the decision problems of coordinating parties, manufacturer and retailer. The coordination is formed in a dynamic setting, where a feedback relationship exists between the return incentive policy of the retailer, and the revenue sharing incentive strategy of the manufacturer. To model this process, we have adopted the use of a system dynamics (SD) approach. \{SD\} is well suited for studying the behavior of complex systems over time, and where internal feedbacks and delays exist. We first identify Pareto-optimal solutions, for individual players, and from environmental perspectives of landfill diversion and carbon offset. We then focus on revenue sharing, as a widely practiced coordination scheme in reverse supply chains. It resembles a leader–follower (Stackelberg) strategic decision-making game, with an equilibrium solution that yields lower performance for environmental criteria. In this context, we investigate if/how a revenue sharing mechanism can be coordinated to achieve a higher environmental performance. "

After surveying some players in Taiwan, we found that three antecedents have significant and positive effects on online game service satisfaction and which, in turn, significantly affect online loyalty. Especially, service quality has the relatively higher total positive effects on both online game satisfaction and loyalty. Meanwhile, online game satisfaction completely mediates the effects of these three antecedents on online loyalty. The findings imply that how to manage online game service quality better, provide more acceptable transaction cost, and offer more experiential value are the key ways for effectively enhancing players’ satisfaction with the online game service in order to retain their loyalty to the online game service system.

abstract = "Abstract In this paper, we investigate the problem how to design optimal security mechanism for the Kalman filtering of Networked Control Systems (NCSs) with a DoS attacker under limited resources. A two-player zero-sum stochastic game is formulated to model not only the dynamic interaction between the network administrator (as a defender) and the DoS attacker (as an attacker), but also the transitions between the two states (on/off) of the communication link. In specific, we take the degraded dynamic performance of physical systems into consideration when we design the network security mechanism. In this stochastic game, the cost function consists of two parts: one component is the network resource cost, the other one is the degraded dynamic performance of the Kalman filtering of the NCS, indexing by the trace of the estimation error covariance matrix. The optimal defense and attack strategies are obtained by using stochastic dynamic programming (SDP). A linear \{NCS\} is used to illustrate the procedure of the proposed stochastic game formulation and solving it by SDP. "

Over the years, supply chains, especially in the movie industry, have adopted multi-period revenue sharing contracts that specify one fraction for each contract period. These revenue sharing contracts are of revenue-independent type such that the revenue sharing fractions are independent of the quantum of revenue generated. Motivated by the recent events in Bollywood – one of the popular arms of the Indian movie industry – in this paper we develop and analyze a game theoretic model for revenue-dependent revenue sharing contracts wherein the actual proportion in which the supply chain revenue is shared among the players depends on the quantum of revenue generated. Our aim is to understand why revenue-dependent revenue sharing contracts are (or not) preferred over revenue-independent contracts. We also examine if supply chains can be coordinated over multiple periods using both types of revenue sharing contracts. We build a two-period model characterizing supply chains in the movie industry and highlight the implications of the multi-period contractual setting for the supply chain coordinating revenue sharing contracts. We show that supply chains can be perfectly coordinated using both types of revenue sharing contracts; however, there exist situations in which revenue-dependent contracts outperform revenue-independent contracts. Using revenue-dependent revenue sharing contracts supply chains can be coordinated while providing positive surplus to the supply chain players that is otherwise not possible under certain situations in revenue-independent contracts. We also demonstrate how revenue-dependent contracts enhance supply chain coordination and highlight their significance when the drop in the revenue potential from one period to another is moderate. "

Using modern game theory, decision-making analyses about chaos control of the model are taken by taking aggregate profits as players’ payoff. It is found that the speed of players’ response to the market and whether the decisive parameters are in the stable region of the Nash equilibrium or not have a distinct influence on the results of the game. The impact of cost function’ type on results of the game is also found. The mechanism of influences is discovered by using numerical simulation. "

For \{AR\} a recursively presented structure let ф:AltAg→OutAG be the task correspondence for \{AG\} that associates elements of an alternative space with elements of an outcome space. The Turing degree of the structure \{AG\} is defined to be deg(AG):=(graph(ф)) and is the degree of complexity of a computable realization of the task of AG. If deg(graph(ф))≠0, then the realization of the task associated with the game \{AG\} is not recursive. The partial ordering of the Turing degrees is used to rank the minimal degrees of unsolvability (i.e. deg(AG)≠0) associated with recursive presentations of the following game-theoretic structures:(i) γG: Infinite stage Gale-Stewart games, (ii) \{UG\} prioric Banach-Mazur games, (iii) CG: Single-player choice functions, (iv) AG: Walrasian models of general equilibrium, (v) BG: N-person non-cooperative games in the sense of nash. The results of the paper are the following: Theorem 1. Sup{min(deg(γG)),min(deg(UG))}≤0'. Theorem 2. 0'&lt;Inf{min(deg(CG)),min(deg(AG))}. Collary. Sup{min(deg(γUG)),min(deg(UG))}&lt;min(deg(BG)). From Theorem 1, minimal degrees of unsolvability for the structures γG and \{UGare\} bounded by the interval (0,0'] in D, the set of Turing degrees of reducibility; and thus by the results of Jockusch and Soare (1972) we have the characterization of minimal degrees for these structures as precisely the degrees of members of special recursively bounded П01-classes.

In this research, fuzzy logic (FL) concept and game theory are being used to model strategic decision making processes by business organizations. Competition between business organizations is viewed as a game with each business organization as a player. A player formulates his own decisions by making his strategic moves based on uncertain information. This is the information he has about the opponents with respect to prevailing or anticipated market demand, cost of production, marketing, consolidation efforts and some other business variables. This uncertain information is being modelled using the concept of fuzzy logic. The game is played between a fuzzy agent and human agents in a resource allocation game between two players with uncertain information. Moreover, fuzzy rules are constructed that symbolize various rules and strategic variables that a firm takes into consideration before taking a decision. Our model also includes a learning procedure that enables the agent to optimize the fuzzy rules and his decision processes. Matlab software was used for the design and implementation of the fuzzy decision making system and this procedure and methodology can be easily implemented by business managers and can assist them in their strategic policy formulation.

Many previous studies explored this question via setting spatial background, where players obtain their payoffs by playing game with their nearest neighbors. Another undoubted fact is that the environment plays an important role in the individual development. Inspired by these phenomena, we reconsider the definition of individual fitness which integrates the environment, denoted by the average payoff of all individual neighbors, with the traditional individual payoffs by introducing a selection parameter u . Tuning u equal to zero returns the traditional version, while increasing u bears the influence of environment. We find that considering the environment, i.e., integrating neighborhoods in the evaluation of fitness, promotes cooperation. If we enhance the value of u , the invasion of defection could be resisted better. We also provide quantitative explanations and complete phase diagrams presenting the influence of the environment on the evolution of cooperation. Finally, the universality of this mechanism is testified for different neighborhood sizes, different topology structures and different game models. Our work may shed light on the emergence and persistence of cooperation in our life. "

These properties can be viewed as quantitative refinements of the classical notion of fair path in a concurrent system, whose simplest form checks whether all colors occur infinitely often. Our notions provide stronger criteria, particularly suitable for scheduling applications based on a coarse-grained model of the jobs involved. In particular, they enforce a given set of priorities among the jobs involved in the system. We show that both problems we address are solvable in polynomial time, by reducing them to the feasibility of a linear program. We also consider two-player games played on finite colored graphs where the goal is one of the above frequency-related properties. For all the goals, we show that the problem of checking whether there exists a winning strategy is Co-NP-complete. "

We show that a reasonable punishment with a uniform tolerance can spur individuals to make more investments. Additionally, for a fixed punishment cost and a fixed fine, a moderate value of tolerance can result in the best promotion of cooperation. Furthermore, we investigate the coevolutionary dynamics of investment and tolerance. We find that the population splits into two branches: high-tolerance individuals who make high investments and low-tolerance individuals who make low investments. A dynamic equilibrium is achieved between these two types of individuals. Our work extends punishment to continuous cooperative behaviors and the results may enhance the understanding of altruistic punishment in the evolution of human cooperation. "

On the network describing relationships among data points, an edge-removing-and-rewiring (ERR) function is employed to explore in a neighborhood of a data point, which removes edges connecting to neighbors with small payoffs, and creates new edges to neighbors with larger payoffs. As such, the connections among data points vary over time. During the evolution of network, some strategies are spread in the network. As a consequence, clusters are formed automatically, in which data points with the same evolutionarily stable strategy are collected as a cluster, so the number of evolutionarily stable strategies indicates the number of clusters. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

We constructed an evolutionary game theory model in which each player has an attitude and behavior toward a single social norm, and the players' attitudes and behaviors are affected by three types of cultural transmission: vertical, oblique, and horizontal. We assumed that strategy is a combination of attitude and behavior and that the process of learning or transmitting the social norm depends on the life stage of each player. Adults play a coordination game in which players whose behaviors match those of the majority obtain a high payoff, which is diminished by any inconsistency between attitude and behavior. The adults' strategies are passed to newborns via vertical transmission, and the frequency of a newborn's replication of strategy is proportional to the corresponding adult's payoff. Newborns imitate behaviors of unrelated adults via oblique transmission. Juveniles change their attitudes or behaviors by observing other juveniles' behaviors or inferring other juveniles' attitudes (horizontal transmission). We conclude that the key factor for sustaining inconsistency between attitude and behavior is the ability of players to infer and imitate others' attitudes, and that oblique transmission promotes inconsistency.

Previous studies have applied game theoretic model by finding Nash equilibrium to investigate this phenomenon. However computation of the Nash equilibrium requires an understanding of the payoff matrix that allocates the rewards received by players when they adopt each of the strategies in the game. In our study we present a dynamic programming implemented framework to compute 2 × 2 intraspecific finite resource allocation game's payoff matrix explicitly. We assume that two distinct types of individuals, aggressive and non-aggressive, are in the population. Then we divide the entire animal development period into three different stages: initialization, quasilinear growth and termination. Each stage for each type of players is specified with their own development coefficient, which determines how resource consumption could convert into strength as reward. Each player has equal and finite resource at the beginning of their development and fights against other players in the population to maximize its own potential reward. Based on these assumptions it is reasonable to use backward induction dynamic programming to compute payoff matrix. We present numerical examples for three different types of aggressive individuals and compute the payoff matrices correspondingly. Then we use the derived payoff matrices to determine the Nash equilibrium and Evolutionary Stable Strategy. Our research provide a framework for future quantitative studies on animal resource competition problems and could be expanded to n-players interspecific stochastic asymmetric resource allocation problem by changing some settings of dynamic programming formulation.

Information systems outsourcing arrangements cover the spectrum from agreements involving the delivery of all information services to those providing specific services such as systems development, communications management, desktop computing provision and maintenance, and so on. In this paper we model information systems outsourcing arrangements as a non-cooperative game with two players: a company and an outsourcing vendor. The game between the two players has an inherent double moral hazard problem as the success of the information system outsourcing project depends on the actions of both players, which are costly for them and are not directly contractible. Both parties make their decisions taking into account the effects that these decisions have on the other player's actions. In our analysis, we compare the solution obtained without a moral hazard problem (the first-best solution) to the one obtained under a double moral hazard setting (the second-best solution). We demonstrate some results based on the assumption that increases in the productivity of the vendor lead to increases in the productivity of the company. Further we establish that outsourcing contracts should provide no separate payment for failure to the outsourcing vendor although effectively many of them do. We also provide a sharing rule for providing appropriate incentives for the vendor and examine the dynamics associated with this sharing rule. Finally, we further provide for the characterization of response functions and the ensuing Nash solution including the optimal outsourcing fee. This allows for the nuanced consideration of the degree of interaction between the effort of one party and the productivity of the effort of the other party.

We consider the demand of the downstream player, e.g., the retailer, being price and shelf-space sensitive. Under such a setting, the retailer decides on the revenue-sharing percentage and the slotting fee. And the upstream player, e.g., the manufacturer, decides on the retail price and the size of shelf-space. For each item sold, the retailer deducts an agreed-upon percentage from the selling price and remits the balance to the manufacturer. We model the decision-making of the two firms as a Stackelberg game, and carry out equilibrium analysis for both the centralized and decentralized regimes of the channel, with and without cooperation. In addition, a profit sharing scheme through a two-part slotting allowance is proposed, which leads to Pareto improvements among channel participants. Our analysis reveals that the non-cooperative game tends to set a higher revenue-sharing percentage and lower slotting fee by the retailer, and a higher retail price and less display space by the manufacturer, which leads to a lower channel profit. The consistent bias can be perfectly rectified by the cooperative game through the proposed two-part contractual agreement. "

Moulin [The Strategy of Social Choice, North Holland, Amsterdam, 1983]: All the considered game situations are framed by the same game structure. The structure determines the families of potential decisions of the two players, as well as the subsets of possible outcomes allowed by pairs of such choices. To be a solution of a game, a pair of decisions has to determine a (pure) functional equilibrium of the situational pair of payoff mappings which transforms the realized outcome into real-valued rewards of the players. Accordingly we understand that a structure is stable, if it admits functional equilibria for all possible game situations; and that it is complete, if every situation that only partitions the potential outcomes, is dominated by one of the players. We have generalized and strengthened a theorem by V. Gurvich [Equilibrium in pure strategies, Soviet Math. Dokl. 38 (1989)], proving that a proper structure is stable iff it is complete. Additional results provide game-theoretical insight that focuses the inquiry on the complexity of the stability decision problem; in particular, for coherent structures. These results also have combinatorial importance because every structure is characterized by a pair of hypergraphs [C. Berge, Graphes et Hypergraphes, Dunod, 1970] over a common ground set. The structure is dual (complete/coherent) iff the clutter of one hypergraph equals (includes/is included in) the blocker of the other one. So, for non-void coherent structures, the stability decision problem is equivalent to the much studied subexponential [M.L. Fredman, L. Khachiyan, On the complexity of dualization of monotone disjunctive normal forms, J. Algorithms 21 (1996)] hypergraph duality decision problem. "

The resulting two-stage \{DEA\} model not only provides an overall efficiency score for the entire process, but also yields an efficiency score for each of the individual stages. The current paper develops a Nash bargaining game model to measure the performance of \{DMUs\} that have a two-stage structure. Under Nash bargaining theory, the two stages are viewed as players and the \{DEA\} efficiency model is a cooperative game model. It is shown that when only one intermediate measure exists between the two stages, our newly developed Nash bargaining game approach yields the same results as applying the standard \{DEA\} approach to each stage separately. Two real world data sets are used to demonstrate our bargaining game model. "

In this game, a player can use a mixed strategy (where he uses different links with a positive probability); then he is indifferent between the different link choices. This means that the player may well deviate to a different strategy over time. We propose the concept of evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) as a criterion for stable Nash equilibria, i.e. equilibria where no player is likely to deviate from his strategy. An \{ESS\} is a steady state that can be reached by a user community via evolutionary processes in which more successful strategies spread over time. The concept has been used widely in biology and economics to analyze the dynamics of strategic interactions. We first define a symmetric version of a Bayesian parallel links game where every player is not assigned a task of a fixed size but instead is assigned a task drawn from a distribution, which is the same for all players. We establish that the \{ESS\} is uniquely determined for a given symmetric Bayesian parallel links game (when it exists). Thus evolutionary stability places strong constraints on the assignment of tasks to links. We characterize \{ESS\} for the Bayesian parallel links game, and investigate the structure of evolutionarily stable equilibria: In an ESS, links acquire niches, meaning that there is minimal overlap in the tasks served by different links. Furthermore, all links with the same speed are interchangeable for every task with weight w : Every player must place a task with weight w on links having the same speed with the same probability. Also, bigger tasks must be assigned to faster links and faster links must have a bigger load. Finally, we introduce a clustering condition–roughly, distinct links must serve distinct tasks–that is sufficient for evolutionary stability, and can be used to find an \{ESS\} in many models. "

Differing from other coevolution models, players rewire their network connections according to the density of cooperation and other players’ payoffs. We use a parameter α to control the effect of payoff in the process of rewiring. Based on the asynchronous update rule and Monte Carlo simulation, we find that, when players prefer to rewire their links to those who are richer, the temptation can increase the cooperation density.

The empirical results and the analysis based on them support theoretical findings. It is possible that the winner pays more than €1 to get €1 because of his expectations about competitors’ bids and because of his indifference over a certain interval. The results are symptoms of some risk aversion. In an English auction escalation leads to this result, but when escalation is ruled out, expectations and indifference of preferences can lead to the same result. "

We propose a wage-based incentive mechanism for enforcing truthful report for non-verifiable information in self-interested \{P2P\} networks.

abstract = "This paper (see also [1]) extends the alternating Turing machine (A-TM) of Chandra, Kozen and Stockmeyer [2], the private and the blind alternating machines of Reif [3,4] to model multiplayer games of incomplete information. We use these machines to provide matching lower bounds for our decision algorithms described in our companion paper [5]. We also apply multiple person alternation to other machine types. We show that multiplayer games of incomplete information can be undecidable general. However, one form of incomplete information games that is decidable we term as hierarchical games (defined later in this paper). In hierarchical multiplayer games, each additional clique (subset of players with same information) increases the complexity of the outcome problem by a further exponential. Consequently, if a multiplayer game of incomplete information with k cliques has a space bound of S(n), then its outcome can be k repeated exponentials harder than games of complete information with the same space bound S(n). This paper proves that this exponential blow-up must occur in the worst case. We define TEAM-PRIVATE-PEEK and TEAM-BLIND-PEEK, extending the previous models of PEEK. These new games can be shown to be complete for their respective classes. We use these games to establish lower bounds on complexity of multiplayer games of incomplete information and blindfold multiplayer games. We analyze the time bounded alternating machines, and conclude that time is not a very critical resource for multiplayer alternation. We also show \{DQBF\} (a variant of QBF) to be complete in NEXPTIME. "

Perceptual measures are an effective alternative, yet most validated scales are too long for daily use. Design This study utilises a longitudinal multi-level design to test an adapted Brief Assessment of Mood (BAM+), with four extra items and a 100 mm visual analogue scale to measure recovery. Methods Elite under-21 academy soccer players (N = 11) were monitored across five games with data (BAM+, \{CK\} and PPO) collected for each game at 24 h pre, 24 h and 48 h post-match. Match activity data for each participant was also collected using \{GPS\} monitors on players. Results BAM+, \{CK\} and \{PPO\} had significant (p &lt; .05) linear and quadratic growth curves across time and games that matched the known time reports of fatigue and recovery. Multi-level linear modelling (MLM) with random intercepts for ‘participant’ and ‘game’ indicated only \{CK\} significantly contributed to the variance of BAM+ scores (p &lt; .05). Significant correlations (p &lt; .01) were found between changes in BAM+ scores from baseline at 24 and 48 h post-match for total distance covered per minute, high intensity distance covered per minute, and total number of sprints per minute. Conclusions Visual and inferential results indicate that the BAM+ appears effective for monitoring longitudinal recovery cycles in elite level athletes. Future research is needed to confirm both the scales reliability and validity. "

From manufacturers’ perspective, the diversity must be maintained in a level in which the engineering costs do not exceed the acquired advantages of increased market share. On the other hand, product portfolio diversity is prominent for customers. In addition, manufacturers should always be careful about competitors activity. Therefore, we consider the problem of product portfolio management (PPM) in a competitive environment. This paper constructs a game theory-based mathematical model to deal with this new \{PPM\} problem. In this presented mathematical model, the \{PPM\} problem is formulated as a 2-person non-cooperative game with complete information. Each player has a set of strategies which correspond to the feasible product portfolios. Every payoff is determined by the procedure that considers the customer–engineering interaction in product portfolio planning, which aims to optimize product portfolio for a target market segment, and proposed a maximizing surplus share model for it. Therefore, obtaining the optimal product portfolio is determined by the Nash equilibrium point of this game. Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach.

Moreover, if the game is strictly convex then every subgame perfect Nash equilibrium results in a structure that is payoff equivalent to the full cooperation structure. Subsequently, we analyze a game with six players that is symmetric and strictly convex. We show that there exists a subgame perfect Nash equilibrium that results in an incomplete structure in which two players are worse off than in the full cooperation structure, whereas four players are better off. Independent of the initial order any pair of players can end up being exploited. "

This model is among the most frequently cited papers on the topic of “dishonest” signaling and supports the view that signals may be “dishonest” as long as they are “honest on average”. Using genetic algorithms, we demonstrate that another solution exists to the game, an evolutionarily stable set of Nash equilibria in which members of the set never signal and all donors give their resource. Payoffs to players using this set of strategies is greater those when playing the “dishonest” signaling ESS. We demonstrate that a random population is far more likely to evolve to this non-communicating strategy set than the “dishonest” signaling ESS. We also discuss the dynamics of biological game theory models and the advances of genetic algorithms as a heuristic solution method for these models. "

Foraging is commonly theorized using either random or correlated movements based on Lévy walks, or a series of decisions to remain or leave proximal areas known as “patches”. Neither class of model makes use of spatial memory, but search performance may be enhanced when information about searched and unsearched locations is encoded. A video game was developed to test the role of human spatial memory in a canonical foraging task. Analyses of search trajectories from over 2000 human players yielded evidence that foraging movements were inherently clustered, and that clustering was facilitated by spatial memory cues and influenced by memory for spatial locations of targets found. A simple foraging model is presented in which spatial memory is used to integrate aspects of Lévy-based and patch-based foraging theories to perform a kind of area-restricted search, and thereby enhance performance as search unfolds. Using only two free parameters, the model accounts for a variety of findings that individually support competing theories, but together they argue for the integration of spatial memory into theories of foraging.

In particular, this logic allows for the explicit expression of coalition abilities in such systems, modelled as infinite transition games between the coalition and its complement. Formally, \{ATL\} is a non-normal multi-modal extension of \{CTL\} (regarded as a one-player fragment of ATL) with temporal operators indexed by coalitions of players, and thus expressing selective quantification over those paths which can be effected as outcomes of infinite transition games between the coalition and its complement. We present a sound and complete axiomatization of the logic ATL, based on Pauly's axiomatization of his Coalition Logic, augmented with axioms and rules for fixed point formulae characterizing the temporal operators. The completeness proof is by construction of a bounded branching tree model for each ATL-consistent formula. These models can be folded into finite models, thus rendering the finite model property for ATL. We also describe an automata-based decision procedure for \{ATL\} by translating the satisfiability problem to the nonemptiness problem for alternating automata on infinite trees. When considering formulae over a fixed finite set of players the decidability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete. "

A local cost function f(i,e) is given for every player i∈I and for every move e∈E. The players are allowed only pure stationary strategies, that is the move in any position is deterministic, and may depend only on this present position, not on the preceding positions or moves. In this case the resulting play p is a directed path which begins in the initial position v0 and either (i) ends in a terminal position or (ii) results in a simple directed cycle. Given a play p, for each player i∈I the effective cost f(i,p) is defined as the sum of all local costs along the path f(i,p)=Σe∈pf(i,e) in case (i), or as f(i,p)=+∞ in case (ii). The local cost function f and the corresponding game is called terminal if f(i,e)=0, unless e is a terminal move. The players wish to minimize their effective costs, in particular they should avoid cycles. A game is called Nash-solvable if it has a Nash equilibrium in pure stationary strategies and properly Nash-solvable if the corresponding play results in a final position, not in a cycle. It is easy to demonstrate that already zero-sum games with two players may not be solvable. However, Nash-solvability turns into an exciting open problem under the following simple additional condition: (♣) all local costs are non-negative, that is f(i,e)≥0 for all i∈I and e∈E, or under the seemingly weaker, but in fact equivalent, condition: (♠) Σe∈c f(i,e)≥0, for all i∈I and for each simple directed cycle c in G. In all examples, which we were able to analyze, games satisfying (♣) are properly Nash-solvable, yet, even the Nash-solvability of such games is an open problem. In this paper we prove proper Nash-solvability for the following special cases: (a) play-once games, that is the games in which every player controls only one position, (b) terminal games with two players, and (c) terminal games with only two terminal moves. We also show that in each of these cases a Nash equilibrium can be constructed in polynomial time in the size of the graph G. "

Unlike the pure Wardropian equilibrium, there might be in reality both competition and cooperation among users, typically when there exist oligopoly Cournot-Nash (CN) firms. In this paper, we first formulate a mixed behavior network equilibrium model as variational inequalities (VI) that simultaneously describe the routing behaviors of user equilibrium (UE), system optimum (SO) and \{CN\} players, each player is presumed to make routing decision given knowledge of the routing strategies of other players. After examining the existence and uniqueness of solutions, the diagonalization approach is applied to find a mixed behavior equilibrium solution. We then present a Stackelberg routing game on the network in which the \{SO\} player is the leader and the \{UE\} and \{CN\} players are the followers. The \{UE\} and \{CN\} players route their flows in a mixed equilibrium behavior given the \{SO\} player’s routing strategy. In contrast, the \{SO\} player, realizing how the \{UE\} and \{CN\} players react to the given strategy, routes its flows to minimize total system travel cost. The Stackelberg game of network flow routing is formulated as a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). Using a marginal function approach, the \{MPEC\} is transformed into an equivalent, continuously differentiable single-level optimization problem, where the lower level \{VI\} is represented by a differentiable gap function constraint. The augmented Lagrangian method is then used to solve the resulting single-level optimization problem. Some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the proposed models and algorithms. "

When the number of players in the game is increased from two to three and the game is played for unusually high stakes with group composition being randomly changed from trial to trial, the paradox is considerably weakened as players approach equilibrium play with multiple iterations of the stage game. When the game is played with low stakes, there is no evidence for equilibrium play or learning across iterations of the stage game. An adaptive learning model that assumes updating of the individual probabilities of choice outperforms alternative static and dynamic models in accounting for the major results observed in the high-stake experiment.

Proving that one logic is more succinct than another becomes harder when the underlying semantics is stronger. We propose to use Formula Size Games (as put forward by Adler and Immerman (2003) [1], but we present them as games for one player, called Spoiler), games that are played on two sets of models, and that directly link the length of a play in which Spoiler wins the game with the size of a formula, i.e., a formula that is true in the first set of models but false in all models of the second set. Using formula size games, we prove the following succinctness results for m-dimensional modal logic, where one has a set I = { i 1 , … , i m } of indices for m modalities: (1) on general Kripke models (and also on binary trees), a definition [ ∀ Γ ] φ = ⋀ i ∈ Γ [ i ] φ (with Γ ⊆ I ) makes the resulting logic exponentially more succinct for m &gt; 1 ; (2) several modal logics use such abbreviations [ ∀ Γ ] φ , e.g., in description logics the construct corresponds to adding role disjunctions, and an epistemic interpretation of it is ‘everybody in Γ knows’. Indeed, we show that on epistemic models (i.e., S 5 -models), the logic with [ ∀ Γ ] φ becomes more succinct for m &gt; 3 ; (3) the results for the logic with ‘everybody knows’ also hold for a logic with ‘somebody knows’, and (4) on epistemic models, Public Announcement Logic is exponentially more succinct than epistemic logic, if m &gt; 3 . The latter settles an open problem raised by Lutz (2006) [18]. "

However, determining the global system behavior that will arise from local stigmergetic interactions is a complex problem. In this paper we propose to use Game Theory to analyze stigmergetic interactions. We show that a system where agents coordinate by sharing local pheromone information can be approximated by a limiting pheromone game in which different pheromone vectors represent player strategies. This game view allows us to use established methods and solution concepts from game theory to describe the properties of stigmergy based systems. Our goal is to provide a new framework to aid in the understanding and design of pheromone interactions. We demonstrate how we can use this system to determine the long term system behavior of a simple pheromone model, by analyzing the convergence properties of the pheromone update rule in the approximating game. We also apply this model to cases where multiple colonies of agents concurrently optimize different objectives. In this case a limiting colony game can be linked to colony level interactions to characterize the global system behavior. "

Although Game Theory is a flawed concept, it can be helpful in charactering interactions in \{ESO\} transactions. \{ESOs\} involve a two-stage game that can be modeled. There are no perfect Nash Equilibria for the two sub-games.

It is found that the existence of influential individuals who play Role I turns out to be detrimental to cooperation and that the larger the number of influential individuals is, the more difficult it is for cooperation to be maintained. For those playing supervisory roles, both punishment and reward are found to be effective ways for the influential individuals to promote and stabilize cooperative behavior. By comparing the critical costs and the mean payoffs for a low multiplication factor under the role of punishment and the role of reward, it is found that reward is a more effective intervention measure than punishment for influential individuals seeking to improve cooperation and that reward leads to a higher mean payoff.

Here we present a game theoretical model to explain the presence and prevalence of infanticide in primate groups. We have formulated a three-player game involving two males and one female and show that the strategies of infanticide on the males' part and polyandrous mating on the females' part emerge as Nash equilibria that are stable under certain conditions. Moreover, we have identified all the Nash equilibria of the game and arranged them in a novel hierarchical scheme. Only in the subspace spanned by the males are the Nash equilibria found to be strict, and hence evolutionarily stable. We have therefore proposed a selection mechanism informed by adaptive dynamics to permit the females to transition to, and remain in, optimal equilibria after successive generations. Our model concludes that polyandrous mating by females is an optimal strategy for the females that minimizes infanticide and that infanticide confers advantage to the males only in certain regions of parameter space. We have shown that infanticide occurs during turbulent changes accompanying male immigration into the group. For changes in the dominance hierarchy within the group, we have shown that infanticide occurs only in primate groups where the chance for the killer to sire the next infant is high. These conclusions are confirmed by observations in the wild. This model thus has enabled us to pinpoint the fundamental processes behind the reproductive decisions of the players involved, which was not possible using earlier theoretical studies. "

Players obtain a payoff from interaction with all their immediate neighbors. We consider three different update rules, called ‘birth–death’, ‘death–birth’ and ‘imitation’. A fourth update rule, ‘pairwise comparison’, is shown to be equivalent to birth–death updating in our model. We use pair approximation to describe the evolutionary game dynamics on regular graphs of degree k. In the limit of weak selection, we can derive a differential equation which describes how the average frequency of each strategy on the graph changes over time. Remarkably, this equation is a replicator equation with a transformed payoff matrix. Therefore, moving a game from a well-mixed population (the complete graph) onto a regular graph simply results in a transformation of the payoff matrix. The new payoff matrix is the sum of the original payoff matrix plus another matrix, which describes the local competition of strategies. We discuss the application of our theory to four particular examples, the Prisoner's Dilemma, the Snow-Drift game, a coordination game and the Rock–Scissors–Paper game. "

This paper characterizes a class of games in which that insight holds. The key to bad reputation is that participation is optional for the short-run players, and that every action of the long-run player that makes the short-run players want to participate has a chance of being interpreted as a signal that the long-run player is “bad.” We allow a broad set of commitment types, allowing many types, including the “Stackelberg type” used to prove positive results on reputation. Although reputation need not be bad if the probability of the Stackelberg type is too high, the relative probability of the Stackelberg type can be high when all commitment types are unlikely. "

Duality of risk sensitivity to the multiplier version of min–max expected utility theory of Hansen and Sargent (2001) allows us to compute risk-sensitivity operators by solving two-player zero-sum games. Because the approximating model is a Gaussian probability density over sequences of signals and states, we can exploit a modified certainty equivalence principle to solve four games that differ in continuation value functions and discounting of time t increments to entropy. The different games express different dimensions of concerns about robustness. All four games give rise to time consistent worst-case distributions for observed signals. But in Games I–III, the minimizing players’ worst-case densities over hidden states are time inconsistent, while Game \{IV\} is an \{LQG\} version of a game of Hansen and Sargent (2005) that builds in time consistency. We show how detection error probabilities can be used to calibrate the risk-sensitivity parameters that govern fear of model misspecification in hidden Markov models. "

Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a \{MMOG\} played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to ‘survive’ and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a ‘socio-economic laboratory’ which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences.

We model multilateral collaboration among countries as a two-level coalitional game of heterogeneous players with a stepwise emission reduction over a finite and discretized period of time. The formed coalition is assumed to hold a leader's position in the game, and the players that did not join the agreement (free-riders) are assumed to accept a position of the followers. To analyze fulfillment of the emission reduction targets, we construct a time-consistent abatement scheme, which reallocates the players abatement commitments over time. We examine a free-riding problem and introduce a property of time-consistency of the agreement. We show that in some case free-riding incentives of the signatories can be eliminated and internal dynamic stability of the agreement can be maintained. "

Each player is modelled by a Markov Chain. Using the “joint payoff function”, the considered game problem is formulated in terms of, so-called, counter-coalition variables. The suggested generalization of Mangasarian-Stone theorem permits to reformulate this problem as a linear programming with some additional bilinear constraints. A gradient approach of computing fixed points of equilibrium problems is applied on a function of the Lagrangian of the mathematical programming equivalent problem to obtain the Nash equilibrium point.

The history of the rivals’ output quantities (supplies) and the market clearing price (MCP) are the only available information to the players. The convergence of the algorithm (for both estimation and decision making processes) is discussed. In addition, the stability conditions of the equilibrium points are analyzed using the converse Lyapunov theorem. Through the case studies, which are performed based on the California Independent System Operator (CA-ISO) historical public data, the theoretical results and the applicability of the proposed method are verified. Moreover, a comparative study among the agents using the proposed method, naïve expectation and adaptive expectation in the market is performed to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method.

The software of Sharetouch was developed within \{XNA\} and .NET frameworks. We project the users as fish in our community pond. Sharetouch displays all the friends as fish when the users log into the system. Therefore, the number of fish equals the number of friends of the users. This design encourages users to make more friends to increase the number of fish. Waterball is a game that combines virtual images and real objects. The concept is based on the Nintendo Wii games, as players hold controllers (real objects) to play the games (virtual images). We also apply the concept of the cloud flash drive to multimedia sharing to avoid the trouble of carrying a real flash disk. This study employed the \{TAM\} measure to measure the validity of Sharetouch in this social platform.

Our results indicate that: (i) if the probability that the opponent is an R-type (TFT-type) player is high, then the time when the opponent adopts a preemption strategy will be early (late); (ii) Market demand growth is an incentive for cooperation among firms; (iii) if the market demand growth rate is high, then the R-type player will not have an evolutionary advantage. We use the competition between cell phone manufacturing firms Nokia and Motorola in China as an example. When Nokia is an R-type player and adopts a preemption strategy, Motorola should preferably use a preemption strategy rather than a “wait” strategy. However, as a TFT-type player, this will benefit Motorola under the situation of market demand growth. "

Existing defense strategies mainly consist of retreating from the jammer or rerouting traffic around the jammed area. In this paper, we tackle the problem from a different angle. Motivated by the high energy-consuming nature of jamming, we propose our defense strategy to defeat the jammer by draining its energy as fast as possible. To gain an in-depth insight on jamming and to evaluate the proposed defense strategy, we model the interaction between the jammer and the victim network as a non-cooperative game which is proven to admit two equilibria. We demonstrate analytically that the proposed defense strategy can eliminate the undesirable equilibrium from the network’s perspective and increase the jammer’s energy consumption at the remaining equilibrium without degrading the performance of the victim network. We also investigate the game dynamics by developing the update mechanism for the players to adjust their strategies based on only observable channel information. Numerical study is then conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed strategy. Results demonstrate its effectiveness in defeating jamming, especially when the jammer is aggressive. "

The payoff function with highest total gain means that according to the game protocols and multidimensional theory, the optimal aircraft configuration within the strategy set will be chosen. The decision-making model is applied to conceptual design process of the high altitude long endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based on the assessment of technological risk. The obtained optimum configuration is quite consistent with the current \{HALE\} \{UAV\} development trends.

We construct a model where the time cost is not explicitly given, but instead depends implicitly on the strategies of the whole population. We identify and analyse the underlying mechanisms responsible for the implicit time cost. Each player participates in a series of games, where those prepared to wait longer win with higher certainty but play less frequently. The model is characterized by the ratio of the winner's score to the loser's score, in a single game. The fitness of a player is determined by the accumulated score from the games played during a generation. We derive the stationary distribution of strategies under the replicator dynamics. When the score ratio is high, we find that the stationary distribution is unstable, with respect to both evolutionary and dynamical stability, and the dynamics converge to a limit cycle. When the ratio is low, the dynamics converge to the stationary distribution. For an intermediate interval of the ratio, the distribution is dynamically but not evolutionarily stable. Finally, the implications of our results for previous models based on the war of attrition are discussed. "

This is especially true for developing countries such as China and India, which face greater risks because of their lack of strategic petroleum reserves (SPRs). China and India both embarked on \{SPR\} planning during the past few years, with the expectation of eliminating the effects of future oil-supply disruptions. In the world oil market, there are probably interactions between the \{SPR\} policies, including acquisition and release strategies, of the two biggest developing countries. Understanding how their \{SPR\} policies interact and vary with important factors would help decision-makers develop more effective policies. In this paper, a stochastic dynamic Nash game model has been developed, in which the players compete with each other and make individual decisions to minimize their expected total \{SPR\} cost. Using the model, it was possible to obtain, for a few cases, illustrative results for each player's strategies for building up and drawing down strategic oil reserves These results indicate that the buildup and drawdown policies of the players are related to many factors, including oil-market elasticity, unit stockpile holding costs, disruption and disruption-continuation probabilities, maximum reserve capacities, and other factors.

In a group setting, the payoffs of a given action depend on what others are doing: the payoffs are frequency-dependent. Figuring out the best course of action in such situations requires game theory analysis. This article applies a game theoretic approach to two decisions that are specific to group foraging: why forage in groups, and why scrounge, that is, use resources discovered by others. Hypotheses for why animals forage in groups come in two types: antipredatory advantages and foraging benefits. I explore the main hypotheses for each type of benefit and question the traditional way of testing these hypotheses. The decision to join groups is approached as a group membership game where the optimal group size is often not a stable outcome. The expected stable group size is a negotiated outcome between group members and intruders, and depends on the extent to which group members can control entry as well as the genetic relatedness among players. The decision to usurp (scrounge) another animal’s resource is analyzed as a producer–scrounger game. The game is such that the scroungers’ payoffs are negatively frequency-dependent; they do better than producers when rare but worse than producers when common. The game has been modeled in terms of intake maximization as well as sensitivity to variance, and qualitative support has been provided experimentally. The article ends with a short discussion on the need to distinguish between evolutionary and behavioral mechanisms for reaching stability and points to the growing body of research devoted to the use of social information within foraging groups.

Objectives To analyse movements and activities of players in international rugby union matches with a sample size sufficient to clearly delineate positional roles. Design Observational study. Methods Actions of 763 players were coded from video recordings of 90 international matches played by the New Zealand national team (the All Blacks) from 2004 to 2010. Movements of players were coded for 27 of these matches via a semi-automated player-tracking system. Movements and activities of all players from both teams were coded. Results Cluster analysis of activities and time-motion variables produced five subgroups of forwards (props, hookers, locks, flankers, Number 8 forwards) and five subgroups of backs (scrum-half, fly-half, midfield backs, wings and fullbacks). Forwards sustained much higher contact loads per match than backs, via scrums, rucks, tackles and mauls. Mean distance covered per match ranged from 5400 to 6300 m, with backs generally running further than forwards. There were marked differences between positional groups in the amount of distance covered at various speeds. The amount of play per match varies by position due to differences in rates at which players are substituted. Conclusions The distance covered by players at relatively fast running speeds (in excess of 5 m s−1) appears to be higher during international matches than when competing at lower levels of the professional game. The specific match demands for positional groups need to be considered when managing player workloads. "

We assume the retailer has a single order opportunity, and decides how much inventory to keep in the middle of selling season. We show that both the price-protection mid-life and end-of-life returns (PME) scheme and the only mid-life and end-of-life returns (ME) scheme may achieve channel coordination and access a ‘win–win’ situation under some conditions. The larger the lowest expected profit of the retailer, the lower the possibility of ‘win–win’ situation will be. Combined with the analysis of feasible regions for coordination policies, we find that \{PME\} scheme is not always better than \{ME\} scheme from the perspective of implementable mechanism. Finally, we find that adopting the dispose-down-to (DDT) policy can bring a larger improvement of the expected channel profit in the centralized setting, and it is interesting that by using \{DDT\} policy, double marginalization occurs only at Period 1, and however, does not plague the retailer in Period 2.

abstract = "We introduce threshold uncertainty, à la Nitzan and Romano (1990), into a private-values model of voluntary provision of a discrete public good. Players are allowed to make any level of contribution toward funding the good, which is provided if the cost threshold is reached. Otherwise, contributions are refunded. Conditions ensuring existence and uniqueness of a Bayesian equilibrium are established. Further restricting the threshold uncertainty to a uniform distribution, we show the equilibrium strategies are very simple, even allowing for any number of players with asymmetric distributions of values. Comparative statics with respect to changes in players' distributions are derived, allowing changes in both the intensity and the dispersion of values. For example, increased uncertainty, in the sense of mean-preserving spreads of players' distributions of values, increases equilibrium contributions. Finally, we show the equilibrium is interim incentive inefficient. The sharpness of our results greatly contrasts with the more qualified insights of earlier private-values models with known cost threshold, which relied on there being two symmetric players and generally exhibited multiple equilibria.

In spite of the enormous popularity of computer chess and in spite of the successes of game tree search in game playing programs, we do not know much about a useful theoretical background that could explain the usefulness of (selective) search in adversary games. We introduce a combinatorial model, which allows us to model errors of a heuristic evaluation function, with the help of coin tosses. As a result, we can show that searching in a game tree will be ‘useful’ if, and only if, there are at least two leaf-disjoint strategies which prove the root value. In addition, we show that the number of leaf-disjoint strategies, contained in a game tree, determines the order of the quality of a heuristic minimax value. The model is integrated into the context of average-case analyses. "

The cost to the player is the total weight of all players who choose that resource, multiplied by the “delay” of that resource. Recent papers have studied the Nash equilibria and social optima of this game in terms of the L ∞ cost metric, in which the social cost is taken to be the maximum cost to any player. We study the L 1 variant of this game, in which the social cost is taken to be the sum of the costs to the individual players, rather than the maximum of these costs. We give bounds on the size of the coordination ratio, which is the ratio between the social cost incurred by selfish behavior and the optimal social cost; we also study the algorithmic problem of finding optimal (lowest-cost) assignments and Nash Equilibria. Additionally, we obtain bounds on the ratio between alternative Nash equilibria for some special cases of the problem. "

This differs from traditional supply chain coordination models under a static case and the case with only demand or cost disruption. The coordination mechanism with revenue sharing is considered, and the effects of production cost and demand disruptions on revenue sharing contract are discussed to investigate the optimal strategies of players with disruptions. The penalty cost is introduced explicitly to obtain the production deviation cost caused by the disruptions. In this study, it is obtained that the coordination contract considering the production deviation cost differs from that without disruption. Besides that, the disruptions may affect the order quantities, wholesale prices as well as revenue sharing contract. Then, the optimal strategies for different disruption levels under the centralized decision-making mode are proposed. Concerning the decentralized mode, the improved revenue sharing contract can be used to coordinate the decentralized decision-making supply chain effectively. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by conducting some numerical examples. "

We investigate how the salience of a dominated strategy affects the extent to which players believe that others will recognize and avoid it. Level-n theory serves as a useful tool in this empirical investigation, as it is able to classify behavior into levels of bounded rationality and provide clear statistical tests for model comparisons. We find that even the most obviously dominated strategies do not induce consistently significant behavioral differences in a variety of one-shot games. Nevertheless, the fit of the Level-n model can be improved by hypothesizing that the Level-0 choices and Level-1 beliefs are tilted slightly away from the uniform distribution to the extent that the average payoff of a strategy falls below a threshold.

We derive the optimal decisions for each player and find that: a higher substitutability of the two products implies a stronger manufacturer's motivation to use retailing channel to act against the retailing channel. We further identify the effects of the retailer's risk sensitivity on the wholesale prices which depend on the channel structure. If the total net price cap for the leader retailer is sufficiently large relative to the follower retailer, then the purchasing option of the retailer affects the supply chain's channel structure significantly.

To tackle this significant challenge, game developers utilize the power of word of mouth (WOM) to diffuse games quickly. However, what influences \{WOM\} intention in the context of online games remains unexplored. To address this gap, this study investigates the manner in which three types of experiences, namely, functional, hedonic, and social, influence WOM. Drawing from the pleasure–arousal–dominance model, the authors propose that user experience leads to \{WOM\} by evoking pleasure, arousal, and dominance. Using the survey data collected from online game players, our study reveals that user experience significantly affects consumer intention to spread WOM. Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed. "

In an initial long-run phase, players explore a complete set of strategies with bounded complexity. Limiting attractions from this phase are the initial attractions in the second, short-run phase, which can be tested against experimental data. Relative to existing models, we can better account for subject behavior in environments where fairness and reciprocity appear to play a significant role. "

We study this problem when the initial number of infectives is very small, which greatly simplifies the analysis. We show in this framework that selfish countries always allocate their resources so as to bring the effective reproduction ratio below one and avoid a major outbreak. When a major outbreak is avoidable, we further identify the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the individual allocation decisions of selfish countries match the decision that a central planner would make in order to minimize the total number of infectives in the whole population (without distinguishing between countries).

Our perspective singles out three basic features: (1) reaping; (2) regarding; and (3) recursive modelling. Reaping involves mechanisms that respond to punishment or reward. Regarding comprises other-regarding or pro-social mechanisms. Recursive modelling encompasses hierarchical cognitive modelling of others through exchanges. Modern work has begun to reveal how these features are realized as modifications to conventional decision-making systems and how they malfunction in disease and injury. "

To fill this void, we consider a two-period dual-channel model in which a manufacturer sells a durable product directly through both a manufacturer-owned e-channel and an independent dealer who adopts a mix of selling and leasing to consumers. Our results show that the manufacturer begins encroaching into the market in Period 1, but the dealer starts withdrawing from the retail channel in Period 2. Moreover, as the direct selling cost decreases, the equilibrium quantities and wholesale prices become quite angular and often nonmonotonic. Among other results, we find that both the dealer and the supply chain may benefit from the manufacturer’s encroachment. Our results also indicate that both the market structure and the nature of competition have an important impact on the player’s (dealer’s) optimal choice of leasing and selling. "

This third agent does not affect the learning process of the other two players, whose only goal is to beat each other. The choice of the best moment to play is based on a threshold associated with the Local Lyapunov Exponent or the Entropy, each computed by using the time series of symbols played by one of the other players.

This paper studies the efficiency of decentralized \{BS\} site selection in a self-organizing network assuming a continuum of locations. Assuming the mobile nodes are uniformly distributed along the circumference of a circle, the optimal solution to the network planning problem, minimizing a weighted sum of transmit energy costs and installation costs, can be stated as a convex minimization problem. In a decentralized network the service providers are modelled as noncooperative players independently deciding on entry, prices and locations. In the circular model the “price of anarchy”, measuring the inefficiency of a decentralized equilibrium solution, is determined by the asymmetry between the uplink and downlink power costs, assuming orthogonal transmitters.

It is argued, first, that epistemic models defined for strategic form representations provide all the materials necessary for defining models for corresponding extensive form representations of the game, models that provide information about the way the game is played that is sufficient to evaluate the rationality of the choices that the players make, and are disposed to make, in the course of playing the dynamic game. Second, two definitions of rationality are compared — one for strategy choices in the normal form representation, and one for the individual choices that the player is disposed to make in the course of playing the dynamic game. It is shown that they are essentially equivalent in games with perfect recall. The main focus is on the intuitive foundational assumptions about rationality and dynamic choice that are needed to motivate the definitions. It is argued that to evaluate the rationality of a player's choices in a dynamic context, it is essential to distinguish passive knowledge (knowledge about nature and about the prior beliefs and strategy choices of other players that is based on observation and inference) fromactive knowledge (knowledge about one's own choices and future choices that is grounded in one's decisions).

Among the proposed models, the selected model by considering cooperative behavior and additional hydrologic information (about the randomness nature of reservoir operation parameters), as exercised by reservoir operator, provides the highest attained level of performance and efficiency.

Nevertheless, its flexibility in weighted inputs and weighted outputs as well as its nature of self-evaluation has been criticized. The cross-evaluation method is developed as a \{DEA\} extensive tool being utilized to identify the best practice \{DMUs\} and to rank all \{DMUs\} using cross-efficiency scores that are associated with all DMUs, however, it still seems imperfect since the non-uniqueness of cross-efficiency measure possibly derogates the practicability of this method, and especially, the average cross-efficiency measure is not a Pareto one, so not all \{DMUs\} have the motivation to accept it. In this paper, we adopt a Nash bargaining game to improve the usual cross efficiency evaluation method. In the game, each \{DMU\} will be an independent player, and the bargaining solution between \{CCR\} efficiency and cross-efficiency can be obtained by using the classical Nash bargaining game model. The advantage of the bargaining efficiency lies on that it is a Pareto one and all the \{DMUs\} will have motivation to accept it, as well as that the adoption of common weights in evaluation will result in the equitableness of ranking all DMUs. Finally, the comparisons of those efficiency scores mentioned above and the corresponding weights are demonstrated by an example of R&amp;D project selection. "

abstract = "Abstract Rangeland-based livestock systems have to deal with the significant instability and uncertainty of the agricultural context (policy changes, volatility of input prices, etc.), and especially of the climatic context. Thus, they are particularly concerned by adaptive management strategies. To support the development of such strategies, we developed a board game including a computer model called “Rangeland Rummy”. It is to be used by groups of farmers and agricultural consultants in the context of short workshops (about 3 h). Rangeland Rummy builds upon five types of material object: (i) a game board; (ii) a calendar stick indicating the starting date of the game board; (iii) sticks marked with the feed resources available for combinations of vegetation types and their management practices; (iv) cards to define animal groups and their feeding requirements throughout the year; (v) cards related to types of feed that can be attributed to animal groups throughout the year. Using these material objects, farmers collectively design a rangeland-based livestock system. This system is immediately evaluated using a computer model, i.e. a spreadsheet providing graphs and indicators providing information on, among other things, the extent to which quantitative and qualitative animal feeding requirements are covered across the year. Playing the game thus consists in collectively and iteratively designing and evaluating rangeland-based livestock systems, while confronting the players with new contextual challenges (e.g. interannual variability of weather, volatility of input prices) or new farmers' objectives (e.g. being self-sufficient for animal feeding). An example of application of Rangeland Rummy with 3 farmers in southern France is reported. Applications show that it tends to develop farmers' adaptive capacity by stimulating their discussions and the exchange of locally-relevant knowledge on management strategies and practices in rangeland-based livestock systems.

In some systems, the background is an organism whose fitness is affected by the predator–prey interaction. In these cases, the phenotype of the background species may evolve to affect the degree of background matching in the predator–prey interaction. For example, some flower species (the background) are inhabited by camouflaged ambush predators that attack visiting pollinators. These flowers have a fitness interest in the outcome of the predator–prey interaction because flowers depend on pollinator visitations for reproduction. Therefore, floral colour might evolve relative to predator colour so as to influence the detectability of resident predators. I have created a three-player game, based on Signal Detection Theory, to model the co-evolution of predator and prey/pollinator behavioural strategies with floral colour. This model makes two general predictions: (1) Constraints on predator distributions favour the evolution of flowers that match the predators’ colour because they prevent predators from overexploiting these flowers; (2) factors that produce less discriminating pollinators also favour the evolution of flowers that match the predators’ colour because these pollinators are willing to land on these flowers even if the safety of the flower is in doubt.

The relationship is examined in terms of the competition of decision-makers for locations. The model discusses difficulties in addressing the characteristics of locations, particularly heterogeneity and indivisibility. A hedonic interpretation is included as a way to resolve these challenges. The model investigates the process in which households make their decisions. This process is shown as an n-player non-cooperative game, following the Nash equilibrium for this game, which is defined as well. The game is accompanied by the systematic interactions between transport and land-use. A mutual adjustment process represents these interactions. The three components are structured by a bi-level mathematical program. The final formulation is interpreted as an oligopolistic Cournot game of which consequence is an approximation of the n-player non-cooperative game. The functional relationship between the decision variables of the upper and the lower levels of the bi-level program produces endogenously-determined transport impedance and locational attractiveness. The endogenous network performance indices of the model are expected to overcome the lack of a realistic network equilibrium description in the existing models. A path-based heuristic algorithm and a simple numerical example are presented. Finally, some concluding remarks are given. "

Game theory, which attempts to mathematically capture behaviour in situations where an organism’s success in making choices depends on the choices of others, is not only important for economists, but also for biologists, veterinarians and other scientists, as it increases understanding of why individual differences exist. John Maynard Smith showed that the success of an individual’s behaviour often depends on others and his Hawk–Dove model is one of the best known examples of game theory: the ‘hawk’ initiates aggressive behaviour (not stopping until injured or until the opponent backs down); the ‘dove’ retreats immediately if the opponent initiates aggressive behaviour and will not fight under any circumstances. Simultaneous hawkish behaviour has the worst pay-off for both players, whereas hawkish behaviour with a dove opponent has the best pay-off. Maynard Smith showed that natural selection will work towards an evolutionarily stable strategy that, when used by an entire population, is resistant to invasion by new mutant strategies. Thus, natural selection actually favours a particular ratio of aggressive hawkish and non-aggressive dovish behaviours in order to maintain a balance of different characteristics in the population. Natural selection has sculpted physiology and behaviour differently in hawks and doves, each in their own way so as to maintain stability of the internal environment through change – a process which is defined as allostasis. In the short term, allostasis has benefits, but in the long run it produces costs. Farm animals have been genetically selected by man for increased product quantity and quality, such as increased muscle volume, lean meat and egg shell quality, accompanied by altered steroid balance (such as more testosterone and less corticosteroids) and lower brain monoamine concentrations (serotonin and dopamine). It is hypothesised that such genetic selection results in the production of farm animals that prefer the hawk behavioural strategy. There is a growing body of evidence that hawk-like animals (such as laying hens and pigs) are more vulnerable to the development of increased impulsivity and compulsivity (stereotypies) as well as violent behaviour.

Assuming rational players, an optimal bidding strategy for constructing the supply function (SF) of a generating firm is presented and based on that, the dynamics of the bid replicators are studied. Both fixed demands and price sensitive demands are taken into account. The replicator model is presented in the well-known state space structure.

We study the problem of determining the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium stopping strategies in this setting. This paper provides results and conditions for the detection of these endogenous effects. First, we show that the presence of such effects is a necessary and sufficient condition for simultaneous exits. This allows us to set up a nonparametric test for the presence of such influences, which is robust to multiple equilibria. Second, we provide conditions under which parameters in the game are identified. Finally, we apply the model to data on desertion in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and find evidence of endogenous influences. "

We will consider the situation in which the players must decide simultaneously, unsure about the decisions of one another, and we will present the problem in a franchising environment. Most problems described in the literature consider sequential rather than simultaneous decisions. In a competitive environment, most problems consider that there is a set of known and already located facilities, and new facilities will have to be located, competing with the existing ones. In the presence of more than one decision-maker, most problems found in the literature belong to the class of Stackelberg location problems, where one decision-maker, the leader, locates first and then the other decision-maker, the follower, locates second, knowing the decisions made by the first. These types of problems are sequential and differ significantly from the problem tackled in this paper, where we explicitly consider simultaneous, non-cooperative discrete location decisions. We describe the problem and its context, propose some mathematical formulations and present an algorithmic approach that was developed to find Nash equilibria. Some computational tests were performed that allowed us to better understand some of the features of the problem and the associated Nash equilibria. Among other results, we conclude that worsening the situation of a player tends to benefit the other player, and that the inefficiency of Nash equilibria tends to increase with the level of competition.

The solution of the game formulation provides not only the decision on accepting or rejecting a connection, but also the amount of bandwidth allocated to a new connection (if admitted). A queueing model considering adaptive modulation and coding in the physical layer is used to analyze quality of service (QoS) performances, namely, the delay performance for real-time and the throughput performance for non-real-time polling services and best effort service. This queueing model is used by the proposed bandwidth allocation and admission control mechanism to ensure that the utilities for both the base station and the new connection are maximized. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by simulation and compared with that of each of the traditional admission control with static and adaptive bandwidth allocation schemes. "

We show that in almost all games, except in a set of measure zero of the parameter space, the Markov perfect equilibrium value of coalitions and the state transition probability that describe the path of coalition formation is locally unique and stable. Therefore, comparative statics analysis are well-defined and can be performed using standard calculus tools. Global uniqueness does not hold in general, but the number of equilibria is finite and odd. In addition, a sufficient condition for global uniqueness is derived, and using this sufficient condition we show that there is a globally unique equilibrium in three-player superadditive games. "

Furthermore, the networking effect is also studied via implementing simulations on four typical network structures. Numerical results show that cooperators can obtain the biggest boost if the elimination threshold is fine-tuned. Notably, this coevolutionary rule drives the initial networks to evolve into statistically stationary states with a broad-scale degree distribution. Our results may provide many more insights for understanding the coevolution of strategy and network topology under the mechanism of nature selection whereby superior individuals will prosper and inferior ones be eliminated.

However, the long-run strategy distribution in such a curb set may vary with the share of clever agents. "

In contrast to the classical works in this area, we assume some structure on the times when the faults occur. More realistic seems the model that all faults occur in some small time interval. Like previous work, our problem can best be modelled as a two-player perfect information game, in which one player (“Paul”) has to guess a number x from { 1 , … , n } using Yes/No-questions, which the second player (“Carole”) has to answer truthfully apart from few lies. In our setting, all lies have to be in a consecutive set of k rounds. We show that, for large n, Paul needs roughly log n + log log 2 n + k rounds to determine the number, which is only k more than the case of just one single lie. Our main theorem (1.1) gives precise upper and lower bounds which differ only by a (small) constant. "

This could represent for example, the flow of energy from extraction to end-use demand, or the flow of any natural resource (like phosphate rock) from the extraction to the selling of the final products on the market. We assume that the nodes of the network correspond to different players. A definition of market equilibrium is proposed and characterized through a dynamic programming approach. The case where the players are organized in a coalition structure is also considered. An illustration of this modelling of commodity market equilibria is given for affine demand laws and quadratic transformation costs. "

Atractoscion aequidens is an important species which, owing to a migratory lifestyle, is targeted by commercial communities throughout its estimated 2000 km distribution along the eastern seaboard of southern Africa. The national government is responsible for the management of South Africa’s marine resources; in the case of the linefishery this is effort-based, with limits on minimum size, daily bags, the number of commercial permits and to some extent operational area. Results from an age-structured model reveal that the South African geelbek stock is heavily depleted, and that long term biological sustainability would require an increase in the current minimum size limit and/or a daily bag limit for commercial fishers. Compliance with regulations and thus cooperation with the responsible management authority is also essential. Cooperative versus non-cooperative management of the South African A. aequidens stock is explored using game theoretic bio-economic modelling, which simulates the effects of alternative size limits and effort restrictions on two separate jurisdictions that compete for this common-pool resource. The large number of players (licensees) within the linefishery creates a costly situation in terms of facilitating cooperative management, in spite of the potential greater long term social and economic benefits that such management arrangements can yield. The distribution of the different life-history stages of geelbek among competing interests on the east coast of South Africa exacerbates the problem of facilitating cooperative management, because the short term private economic benefits of non-cooperation exceeds the long term overall economic benefits from cooperative management.

We answer this question by studying a multichoice minority game model known as MG(Nc,|S|). Numerical simulation shows that these two models have very similar global cooperative behaviors.

If players realize that their own actions modify their opponents’ beliefs and actions, they might play certain actions to this specific end and forego immediate payoffs if the expected payoff gain from a teaching strategy is high enough. Our results support the existence of a teaching strategy in several ways. After exhibiting some regularities consistent with teaching, we examine more precisely the existence of such a strategy. First we show that players update their beliefs in order to take account of the reaction of their opponents to their own action. Second, we examine whether players actually use a teaching strategy by playing an action that induces a poor immediate payoff but is likely to modify the opponent’s behavior so that a preferable outcome might emerge in the future. We find strong evidence of such a strategy in the data and confirm this finding within a logistic model that suggests that the future expected payoff that could arise from a teaching strategy has indeed a significant impact on choice probabilities. Finally, we investigate the effective impact of a teaching strategy on achieved outcomes and find that more tenacious teachers can successfully use such a strategy in order to reach their favorite outcome at the expense of their opponents.

In a fair tournament sufficiently large desert concerns drive identical agents to push their effort levels apart in order to end up closer to their reference points on average. In an unfair tournament, where one agent is advantaged, the equilibrium is symmetric in the absence of desert, but asymmetric in the presence of desert. We find that desert concerns can undermine the standard conclusion that competition for a fixed supply of status is socially wasteful and explain why, when the distribution of output noise is fat-tailed, an employer might use a rank-order incentive scheme.

We propose a model which is essentially based on two assumptions: (1) players consider intervals rather than exact numbers to cope with incomplete knowledge and (2) players iteratively update their recent guesses. It provides an explanation for typical patterns observed in real data, such as the strict positivity of outcomes in the 1-shot setting, the skew background distribution of guessed numbers, as well as the polynomial convergence towards the game-theoretic Nash equilibrium in the iterative setting.

Under some simplified assumptions, this problem can be modeled as a simultaneous-move game confronted by the bidders.

We focus our investigation on the bandwidth allocation among the peers and model this system with non-cooperative game theory. We assume that peers are rational players that maximize their utility, corresponding to minimize their download time. We study the existence of Nash equilibrium points under a very simple server selection policy and show that it is efficiency from the point of view of the bandwidth utilization. "

The decision-making process is described based Game Theory. As such, the players or operators of each subsystem carry out their strategies based on the quantities produced, which results in Nash–Cournot equilibrium. In this model, the importance of the proper transmission line dimensioning is highlighted. It determines the competition level among subsystems and allows for optimization of the whole system without requiring arrangements for managing the congestion of the energy transportation grid. The model was programmed in FORTRAN, using IBM's optimization subroutine library (OSL) package. "

Our main interest is to investigate how the incumbent supplier can strategically maximize her profit by a wholesale pricing policy when facing the potential entrant. We focus on a model where the entrant supplier will sell her product through the same incumbent retailer. We derive the optimal decisions for each player and study the comparative statics of the equilibrium. To investigate how the supply chain structure may affect the deterrence strategy of the incumbent supplier, we also consider three alternative models with different channel structures, when both suppliers sell their products directly, when the entrant has another independent retailer, and when the entrant sells her product directly. Through the comparison, we find that the existence of the common downstream retailer often enhances the deterring motivation of the incumbent supplier. "

However, people seldom play such optimal strategies and adjust their strategies based on their experience. Accordingly, many theories postulate a set of variables related to the probabilities of choosing various strategies and describe how such variables are dynamically updated. In reinforcement learning, these value functions are updated based on the outcome of the player's choice, whereas belief learning allows the value functions of all available choices to be updated according to the choices of other players. We investigated the nature of learning process in monkeys playing a competitive game with ternary choices, using a rock–paper–scissors game. During the baseline condition in which the computer selected its targets randomly, each animal displayed biases towards some targets. When the computer exploited the pattern of animal's choice sequence but not its reward history, the animal's choice was still systematically biased by the previous choice of the computer. This bias was reduced when the computer exploited both the choice and reward histories of the animal. Compared to simple models of reinforcement learning or belief learning, these adaptive processes were better described by a model that incorporated the features of both models. These results suggest that stochastic decision-making strategies in primates during social interactions might be adjusted according to both actual and hypothetical payoffs. "

Detection is accomplished by sampling a subset of the transmitted packets over selected network links or router interfaces. Given a total sampling budget, our framework aims at developing a network packet sampling strategy to effectively reduce the success chances of an intruder. We consider two different scenarios: (1) A well informed intruder divides his attack over multiple packets in order to increase his chances of successfully intruding a target domain. (2) Different cooperating intruders distribute the attack among themselves each send their attack fragments to the target node. Each of the packets containing a fragment of the attack is transmitted through a different path using multi-path routing, where each path is selected with a different probability. Knowing that, if these packets are independently analyzed then the intrusion will not be detected, i.e., a series of packets form an intrusion. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any work done for the case where the attack is split over multiple packets or distributed over cooperative intruders using game theory. Non-cooperative game theory is used to formally express the problem, where the two players are: (1) the smart intruder or the cooperative intruders (depends on which scenario we are solving) and (2) the Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Our game theoretic framework will guide the intruder or the intruders to know their attack strategy and the \{IDS\} to have an optimal sampling strategy in order to detect the malicious packets. "

Results of numerical simulation show that the level of cooperation in the networked minority game differs remarkably from the original minority game as well as the prediction of the crowd–anticrowd theory.

Without a structuring mechanism that allows focus on specific learning domains, the usefulness of the web may be similar to having 500 channels of TV. Learning in these kinds of contexts is not impossible but relies too much on the ability to follow a glut of hyperlinks, and passive information absorption. The effectiveness of the web as a learning tool can be significantly increased by combining it with more constructive tools. These tools should not only allow students to create representations that are interesting to themselves but are also interesting enough to share with other students. This paper presents WebQuest, a system combining the \{WWW\} with the notion of an interactive quest game. Instead of just creating their own homepages, that may be interesting to other students for only social reasons, students turn into authors of their own interactive quest games. They set up complex worlds containing interesting landscapes and tricky obstacles linked to real websites. Players of the game answer questions to acquire important objects needed to solve the quest. This approach provides several learning opportunities to author and players of the games. Authors learn by doing. They create the worlds, come up with challenging yet solvable questions, and provide relevant links to clues on the web. The players, in turn, learn from solving the quest. They can use the links provided by the authors as clues but can also follow their own intuition and use the entire web as a resource to solve the quest. Author and players can start a dialog facilitating reflective learning, for instance, helping authors to understand what makes good or bad questions, how much information should be given in a clue, and how to find new topic-related websites. The system is described, roles of teachers and students are outlined, and we report on our initial classroom uses and ongoing development of WebQuest. "

When an agent faces an exogenous process, we show that, under mild conditions, if reality happens to be simple, the agent will converge to adopt a theory and discard analogical thinking. If, however, reality is complex, analogical reasoning is unlikely to disappear. By contrast, when the agent is a player in a large population coordination game, and the process is generated by all playersʼ predictions, convergence to a theory is much more likely. This may explain how a large population of players selects an equilibrium in such a game, and how social norms emerge. Mixed cases, involving noisy endogenous processes are likely to give rise to complex dynamics of reasoning, switching between theories and analogies. "

The proposer offers the responder how to split a sum of money. The responder decides whether to accept or reject the offer. When the responder accepts it, each player earns money according to the proposer's offer. If the offer is rejected, neither player gets anything. Rejections of “free” money in the \{UG\} represent a deviation from the standard economic model of rationality. This behaviour could be linked to adverse psychological reactions to unfair offers, including anger, hostility and impulsiveness. Currently, it is believed that the most plausible biological system related to anger and impulsivity is the serotonergic system. We hypothesize that serotonergic activity, as measured by platelet serotonin levels, will differentiate subjects who either reject or accept low \{UG\} offers. A sample of 60 economy students (31 males and 29 females, mean age: 24.4 ± 2.3 years) was investigated. As predicted, the mean platelet serotonin level was significantly lower in participants who reject unfair offers (€1 out of €10) than in those who accept (2.86 ± 0.13 versus 3.48 ± 0.11 nmol/109 platelets, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). We conclude that low platelet serotonin may serve as a reliable biomarker to identify people who are more likely to reject unfair ultimatum offers in an experimental neuroeconomic setting. Our pilot data seem to indicate that the serotonergic system may play an important role in the \{UG\} rejection behaviour. "

We present a symbolic abstraction-refinement approach to the solution of two-player games with reachability or safety goals. Given a reachability or safety property, an initial set of states, and a game representation, our approach starts by constructing a simple abstraction of the game, guided by the predicates present in the property and in the initial set. The abstraction is then refined, until it is possible to either prove, or disprove, the property over the initial states. Specifically, we evaluate the property on the abstract game in three-valued fashion, computing an over-approximation (the may states), and an under-approximation (the must states), of the states that satisfy the property. If this computation fails to yield a certain yes/no answer to the validity of the property on the initial states, our algorithm refines the abstraction by splitting uncertain abstract states (states that are may-states, but not must-states). The approach lends itself to an efficient symbolic implementation. We discuss the property required of the abstraction scheme in order to achieve convergence and termination of our technique. "

In contrast to earlier games used for performance evaluations, the new model permits constraints on the strategies available to each of the players, a restriction that is frequently imposed in practice. Despite the more complicated nonlinearities involved in these games compared to classical (finite) two-person forms, the players' solutions (Nash equilibria) can still be described as the optimal solutions to a primal-dual linear programming (LP) pair. If the game's data elements are replaced with the observed inputs and outputs obtained from competing organizations, then the resulting \{LPs\} resemble those currently used in the core ratio models of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Apart from furthering the intertwinement of game theory and DEA, the constrained games feature additional improvements such as the ability to handle zeros in the data, a well-defined sensitivity analysis, and the unification of previous \{DEA\} principles within the context of constrained strategies.

To this we add two constraints—the possibility of sensor failure and the fact that each sensor must tradeoff its own resource consumption with overall network objectives. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of energy-constrained, reliable, data-centric information routing in sensor networks under all the above constraints. Unlike existing techniques, we use game theory to model intelligent sensors thereby making our approach sensor-centric. Sensors behave as rational players in an N-player routing game, where they tradeoff individual communication and other costs with network wide benefits. The outcome of the sensor behavior is a sequence of communication link establishments, resulting in routing paths from reporting to querying sensors. We show that the optimal routing architecture is the Nash equilibrium of the N-player routing game and that computing the optimal paths (which maximizes payoffs of the individual sensors) is NP-Hard with and without data-aggregation. We develop a game-theoretic metric called path weakness to measure the qualitative performance of different routing mechanisms. This sensor-centric concept which is based on the contribution of individual sensors to the overall routing objective is used to define the quality of routing (QoR) paths. Analytical results on computing paths of bounded weakness are derived and game-theoretic heuristics for finding approximately optimal paths are presented. Simulation results are used to compare the QoR of different routing paths derived using various energy-constrained routing algorithms. "

In this paper, we investigate the competitive equilibrium in an oligopolistic market on a freight network. A partially non-cooperative game among shippers, carriers and infrastructure companies (IC) is examined. All three kinds of players act as profit maximizing agents, except that the carriers and \{ICs\} are assumed to behave cooperatively in their own coalitions. We consider the vertically efficient nonlinear tariff schedules which are commonly used in the transportation industry. By introducing a three-stage game-theoretic model, we show that the equilibrium flows can also maximize total system profits if the \{IC\} and the carrier both use vertically efficient nonlinear pricing schedules. The division of the surplus associated with each shipment is obtained by solving a linear programming problem. We provide a few examples under different situations to show the existence of the resulting equilibrium. "

Our model of computation is based on a kind of game in which each play consists of a dialogue of questions and answers between two players who observe the following principles of civil conversation: 1.Justification. A question is asked only if the dialogue at that point warrants it. An answer is proffered only if a question expecting it has already been asked. 2.Priority. Questions pending in a dialogue are answered on a last-asked-first-answered basis. This is equivalent to Gandy's no-dangling-question-mark condition. We analyze pcf-style computations directly in terms of partial strategies based on the information available to each player when he or she is about to move. Our players are required to play an innocent strategy: they play on the basis of their view which is that part of the history that interests them currently. Views are continually updated as the play unfolds. Hence our games are neither history-sensitive nor history-free. Rather they are view-dependent. These considerations give expression to what seems to us to be the nub of pcf-style higher-type sequentiality in a (dialogue) game-semantical setting. "

Method A whole team of high-level professional basketball players (9 men, aged from 23 to 37 years) took part in the study. The biological measures included the salivary concentration of testosterone, cortisol, aamylase, and chromogranin A. The psychological measures involved emotional, cognitive, motivational, bodily, kinesthetic, performance, and communicative components of \{PBS\} states assessed according to the dimensions of their intensity, frequency, and direction (i.e., perceived effect on performance). Assessment was conducted within 1 h prior to competition on an approximately weekly basis across the whole championship for a total of 12 games played at the team's home. Results A series of canonical correlation analyses showed that an increase in the salivary concentration of biological variables was associated with enhanced intensity and frequency scores of pleasant \{PBS\} states, as well as enhanced directional values (i.e., perception of facilitative effects) of a range of both pleasant and unpleasant \{PBS\} states. Conclusion Findings suggest that elevation of testosterone, cortisol, α-amylase, and chromogranin A in basketball players prior to competition can have a perceived functional effect with respect to the upcoming performance.

abstract = "Traditional type systems specify interfaces in terms of values and domains. When we apply a function to an argument, or when we compose two functions, we have to check that their types match. Interface models extend type systems with the ability to reason about the dynamic behavior of design components. For instance, interface models are able to capture temporal-ordering constraints on component interaction, such as constraints on the ordering of method calls or protocol messages, timing constraints on a component's input and output signals, and constraints on the usage of shared resources. Like type systems, interfaces specify both the input assumptions a component makes on its environment and the output guarantees it provides. Interfaces are based on two-player games in which the system plays against the environment. The moves of the environment (player Input) represent the inputs that the system can receive from the environment, that is, the input assumption of the system. Symmetrically, the moves of the system (player Output) represent the possible outputs that can be generated by the system. Interfaces are built around the concepts of (1) well-formedness, requiring that the input assumptions of an interface be satisfiable; (2) compatibility, asking whether two components can be used in a way that satisfies the input assumptions of both components; (3) composition of compatible interfaces; and (4) refinement, asking whether one component (being an implementation) correctly implements another one (being the specification). This paper provides a tutorial-style introduction to interfaces and discusses the basic concepts and ideas. In particular, we elaborate on the automaton-based interfaces from [L. de Alfaro and T.A. Henzinger. Interface automata.

By definition, churn represents the act of a customer leaving a product for good. Most commonly, late customer churn is addressed. In the dynamics of free to play games, most of newly registered users abandon the game in the first few days, so the main focus is on early customer churn. Therefore, successful early churn prevention methodology is vital to having a successful business in free to play gaming industry. To tackle this problem, we introduce a two stage intelligent system. It employs early churn prediction, formulated as a binary classification task, followed by a churn prevention technique using personalized push notifications. For early churn prediction, common machine learning models are trained and compared using a data set obtained from two million players of Top Eleven - Be A Football Manager online mobile game. To prevent churn, we track user activity, identify the game features that are potentially interesting to the user and then use that data to tailor personalized push notifications with a purpose to attract users back into the game. Using this approach, we are able to reduce churn up to 28%, which, at the scale of millions of users, represents a significant positive impact to business. "

A dynamic of nonlinear Cournot duopoly game is analyzed, where players choose quantities with delayed bounded rationality and similar methods of production. The equilibria of the corresponding discrete dynamical systems are investigated. The stability conditions of Nash equilibrium under a local adjustment process are studied. The stability of Nash equilibrium, as some parameters of the model are varied, gives rise to complex dynamics such as cycles of higher order and chaos. We show that firms using delayed bounded rationality have a higher chance of reaching Nash equilibrium. Numerical simulations are used to show bifurcations diagrams, stability regions and chaos. "

In this new arrangement, bidding strategy has become a major issue. Participants in this deregulated energy market place may be able to compete better by choosing a suitable bidding strategy for trading electricity. Different classical methods for decision making in the uncertain environment of the market can be applied to select a suitable strategy. Most of these methods, such as game theory, that insure reaching the best solution for all market participants, require a lot of information about the other market players and the market. However, in the real market place only a little information, such as the spot price, is available for all participants. In this paper, a modified reinforcement learning based on temperature variation has been first proposed and then applied to determine the optimal strategy for a power supplier in the electricity market. A Pool-Co model has been considered here, and the simulation results are shown to be the same as those of standard game theory. Adaptation of the method in the presence of parameter variation has been verified as well. The main advantage of the proposed method is that no information about other participants is required. Furthermore, our investigation shows that even if all participants use this method, they will stay in Nash equilibrium. "

The optimal wholesale price of one supplier is first increasing and then decreasing with the risk sensitivity of the two retailers if the substitutability is sufficiently low, otherwise decreasing with the risk sensitivity. The expected equilibrium order quantity of one retailer is often increasing with his risk sensitivity.

We support this claim by proving convergence to the backward induction solution for all continuous-time monotonic selection dynamics.

As explorers, implementers, testers and promoters of such adaptations, farmers and extension services have to be involved in the design process of adapted farming systems. However, the complexity of most design approaches produced by research (e.g. computer-model-based) keeps them outside the core of this process. Here we present a game called “forage rummy” developed to engage farmers and extension services in being the main players in livestock system design and evaluation. It relies on a number of “boundary objects” developed upon the conversion of scientific knowledge into more usable forms of support. These are a player-friendly game board based on a conceptual model of a livestock system on which flattened wooden sticks marked with year-round forage production and animal feeding requirements have to be assembled with the support of a computerized support system. Playing the game thus consists of repeated cycles of design of livestock systems adapted to scenarios of the agricultural production context and evaluation of their biophysical and organizational feasibility. An application to designing dairy systems adapted to climate change by 2050 is presented. As the first example of a game-based approach for farming system design, forage rummy proves to be useful in stimulating discussion, reflective and interactive analysis and learning about farming systems, their management and the scope for their adaptation. This is attributed to the researchers’ effort to offer transparent and easily-usable forms of support to the design process. We conclude that the learning stimulated by the game could potentially lead to more consistent and concerted action between researchers, extension services and farmers. "

We analyze a similar model in which the costs of cooperation are subject to random shocks. Even if these random shocks are very small, the range of parameters for which cooperation can be sustained is decreased considerably in comparison to the deterministic case. Furthermore, we show how the efficient outcome can be approximated if the level of cooperation can be varied continuously and the cooperation technology has decreasing or constant returns to scale, while this is not possible in the case of increasing returns to scale.

Partial-state asymptotic stability is guaranteed by means of a Lyapunov function that is positive definite and decrescent with respect to part of the system state. The existence of a saddle point for the system׳s performance measure is guaranteed by the fact that this Lyapunov function satisfies a partial differential equation that corresponds to a steady-state form of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equation. In the second part of this paper, we show how our differential game framework can be applied not only to solve pursuit-evasion and robust optimal control problems, but also to assess the effectiveness of a model reference adaptive control law. Specifically, the model reference adaptive control architecture is designed to guarantee satisfactory trajectory tracking for uncertain nonlinear dynamical systems, whose matched nonlinearities are captured by the regressor vector. By modeling matched and unmatched nonlinearities, which are not captured by the regressor vector, as the pursuer׳s and evader׳s control inputs in a differential game, we provide an explicit characterization of the system׳s uncertainties that do not disrupt the trajectory tracking capabilities of the adaptive controller. Two numerical examples illustrate the applicability of our results. "

When a vertex accumulates at least as many brushes as its degree, it sends one brush to each neighbor and is removed from the graph; this may in turn induce the removal of other vertices. The game ends once all vertices have been removed. Min seeks to minimize the number of brushes played during the game, while Max seeks to maximize it. When both players play optimally, the length of the game is the game brush number of the graph G , denoted b g ( G ) . By considering strategies for both players and modeling the evolution of the game with differential equations, we provide an asymptotic value for the game brush number of the complete graph; namely, we show that b g ( K n ) = ( 1 + o ( 1 ) ) n 2 / e . Using a fractional version of the game, we couple the game brush numbers of complete graphs and the binomial random graph G ( n , p ) . It is shown that for p n ≫ ln n asymptotically almost surely b g ( G ( n , p ) ) = ( 1 + o ( 1 ) ) p b g ( K n ) = ( 1 + o ( 1 ) ) p n 2 / e . Finally, we study the relationship between the game brush number and the (original) brush number. "

We find that, in general, each firm’s frequency of product introductions (clockspeed) in equilibrium decreases as its fixed product introduction cost increases. Further, we find that a higher rate of manufacturing learning results in a higher clockspeed and in a higher market share, and also results in significantly worse profits for the competitor. The results underscore the importance of manufacturing expertise in a firm’s ability to introduce new products. "

Of the 3300 participants with valid (no missing) data, 90.1% were males, ranging in age from 19.6 to 57.8 yrs., and serving as sports officials from 3 to 24 yrs. The officials represented high school, collegiate, and professional athletic associations representing 13 sports throughout the United States. Results Using the Rasch model, the level of sources of stress item difficulty and individual's level of acute stress were estimated. Model-data fit was determined by Infit and Outfit statistics (≥0.5 and ≤1.5). A rating scale was also evaluated for proper functioning. With the exception of two items, the model fit the data well. Infit and Outfit measures were within the appropriate range supported the unidimensional structure of the SASS-SO. The two most severe sources of acute stress were “I made an incorrect call” and “I was out of position.” The two least severe sources of acute stress items were “I received verbal abuse from players” and “My supervisor/evaluator was present.” Conclusions The probability thresholds and item response ordering showed that the rating scale functioned well. Although item parameters had slightly inappropriate coverage, the ability parameters were reasonably varied. The results of this study support the use of the SASS-SO in assessing sources of acute stress among sports officials. "
