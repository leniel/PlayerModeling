abstract={Recommendation Systems (RS) are gaining popularity and they are widely used for dealing with information on education, e-commerce, travel planning, entertainment etc. Recommender Systems are used to recommend items to user(s) based on the ratings provided by the other users as well as the past preferences of the user(s) under consideration. Given a set of items from a group of users, Group Recommender Systems generate a subset of those items within a given group budget (i.e. the number of items to have in the final recommendation). Recommending to a group of users based on the ordered preferences provided by each user is an open problem. By order, we mean that the user provides a set of items that he would like to see in the generated recommendation along with the order in which he would like those items to appear. We design and implement algorithms for computing such group recommendations efficiently. Our system will recommend items based on modified versions of two popular Recommendation strategies– Aggregated Voting and Least Misery. Although the existing versions of Aggregated Voting (i.e. Greedy Aggregated Method) and Least Misery perform fairly well in satisfying individuals in a group, they fail to gain significant group satisfaction. Our proposed Hungarian Aggregated Method and Least Misery with Priority improves the overall group satisfaction at the cost of a marginal increase in time complexity. We evaluated the scalability of our algorithms using a real-world dataset. Our experimental results evaluated using a self-established metric substantiates that our approach is significantly efficient. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The problem of ranking Decision Making Units (DMUs) in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been widely studied in the literature. Some of the proposed approaches use cooperative game theory as a tool to perform the ranking. In this paper, we use the Shapley value of two different cooperative games in which the players are the efficient DMUs and the characteristic function represents the increase in the discriminant power of DEA contributed by each efficient DMU. The idea is that if the efficient DMUs are not included in the modified reference sample then the efficiency score of some inefficient DMUs would be higher. The characteristic function represents, therefore, the change in the efficiency scores of the inefficient DMUs that occurs when a given coalition of efficient units is dropped from the sample. Alternatively, the characteristic function of the cooperative game can be defined as the change in the efficiency scores of the inefficient DMUs that occurs when a given coalition of efficient DMUs are the only efficient DMUs that are included in the sample. Since the two cooperative games proposed are dual games, their corresponding Shapley value coincide and thus lead to the same ranking. The more an efficient DMU impacts the shape of the efficient frontier, the higher the increase in the efficiency scores of the inefficient DMUs its removal brings about and, hence, the higher its contribution to the overall discriminant power of the method. The proposed approach is illustrated on a number of datasets from the literature and compared with existing methods. © 2017},

abstract={Knowing which site attributes have relevance for anglers is valuable information for fishery managers seeking to improve angler satisfaction and manage fish stocks. Recreation demand models typically have limited information about site attributes and in many instances is limited to just a few measures for each site. We assemble a recreational angling dataset with extensive information on site attributes and model angling demand to ascertain the importance of attributes in decisions on trip duration. However, we find that only a small number of site attributes are important determinants of trip duration, including attributes such as ease of physical access, availability of guiding services, specimen fish, and ‘catch & release’ status. We also find that importance of site attributes differs by target species. The key site attributes influencing trip duration of anglers targeting coarse species (i.e. non-salmonid) are good physical access or availability of specimen fish, with trip duration to such sites one day longer, on average. Key site attributes for anglers targeting salmonid game species are the availability of guiding services and whether the fishery is regulated as ‘catch & release’. On average, anglers’ trip duration is a half day less in ‘catch & release’ fisheries. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Several e-commerce sites are reaping the benefits of Cross-Domain Recommendation (CDR) systems to cross-sell products, guide new users and increase revenues. Current research works augment user-item ratings with a variety of auxiliary information such as location, personality, geo-tags and multimedia content that link multiple domains to provide effective CDR. In this paper, we propose a fresh perspective for generating recommendations across different domains by tapping the emotions that are encapsulated within user generated textual content such as reviews, blogs and comments. Such emotions serve as strong socio-psychological links between various entertainments domains and have the potential to obviate the cold start problems. Our CDR scheme uses an enriched emotion lexicon to analyze the emotions in online content expressed by users in the source and target domains and generates emotion-profiles of items and users in both domains. Subsequently, it applies collaborative filtering to match these profiles in order to recommend items in the target domain. We illustrate the working of our emotion-based CDR scheme using the movie and book domains as a case study. Experimental results on Movielens and Bookcrossing datasets yield 28.9% F1-measure which is a marked improvement of 71.1% as compared with a recently reported topic modeling approach to CDR for entertainment domains. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={Cooperative data forwarding can improve the performance of data routing in Mobile Social Networks (MSNs). However, previous studies mainly assumed that mobile nodes show selfish behaviors in data relaying merely due to their limited device resources. Nevertheless, the observation of everyday experience infers that they mitigate their selfishness based on their social relationships and content knowledge to achieve their social objective, i.e., they are socially selfish (SS). Therefore, how to promote SS nodes to participate in data forwarding becomes peculiarly challenging in MSNs. In this paper, we propose Game-theoretic Incentive Scheme for Social-aware rOuting, namely GISSO, to stimulate SS nodes in message relaying and guarantee that the routing performance gets maximized when SS nodes follow the scheme. First, we identify the social utility of each message to an intermediate node based on the strength of her social ties and message properties. Then, we apply an alternating-offers bargaining game in which SS nodes trade their messages with the aim of maximizing their social utility. We not only use subgame perfect Nash equilibrium as the agreement of two players to prove the efficiency of our game but also extensively evaluate the performance of GISSO using simulations over two real datasets. The comparison of GISSO with some benchmark social-aware protocols illustrates that GISSO overcomes SS nodes and outperforms the other algorithms regarding message delivery ratio and delay while generates low communication cost. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In this work, we adopt a cooperative game theoretic approach in order to tackle the social ridesharing (SR) problem, where a set of commuters, connected through a social network, form coalitions and arrange one-time rides at short notice. In particular, we address two fundamental aspects of this problem. First, we focus on the optimisation problem of forming the travellers' coalitions that minimise the travel cost of the overall system. To this end, we model the formation problem as a Graph-Constrained Coalition Formation (GCCF) one, where the set of feasible coalitions is restricted by a graph (i.e., the social network). Our approach allows users to specify both spatial and temporal preferences for the trips. Second, we tackle the payment allocation aspect of SR, by proposing the first approach that computes kernel-stable payments for systems with thousands of agents. We conduct a systematic empirical evaluation that uses real-world datasets (i.e., GeoLife and Twitter). We are able to compute optimal solutions for medium-sized systems (i.e., with 100 agents), and high quality solutions for very large systems (i.e., up to 2000 agents). Our results show that our approach improves the social welfare (i.e., reduces travel costs) by up to 36.22% with respect to the scenario with no ridesharing. Finally, our payment allocation method computes kernel-stable payments for 2000 agents in less than an hour—while the state of the art is able to compute payments only for up to 100 agents, and does so 84 times slower than our approach. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In many developing countries like China, the rising housing demand is accompanied by developers’ strategic delay of land development. To explain this puzzle, this paper employs the framework of Option Games with incomplete information, and examines how incomplete information affects the timing and phasing strategy of real estate development. Based on a project-level dataset from Hangzhou city of China, we estimate a hazard model for development timing, and take into account the developer's self-selection of phasing strategies. Major findings of this research are: first, incomplete information undermines the acceleration effect of competition on development timing. Second, this delay effect disappears when the project is developed in multi-phases. Moreover, we show that the estimation can be severely biased without addressing developer's selection problem. Based on our results, we suggest the government should promote the establishment of a public housing transaction platform, to help the developers overcome the limitations of incomplete information and speed up the development cycle. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

For the final model, 42 variables were incorporated to group 761 private HEIs and, separately, 414 public HEIs. A five-cluster solution for each dataset is presented and described. Each cluster contains a description and a managerial recommendation. The application cluster analysis to group HEIs differs from the more popular but more problematic approach of ranking HEIs.

abstract={Why games? How could anyone consider action games an experimental paradigm for Cognitive Science? In 1973, as one of three strategies he proposed for advancing Cognitive Science, Allen Newell exhorted us to “accept a single complex task and do all of it.” More specifically, he told us that rather than taking an “experimental psychology as usual approach,” we should “focus on a series of experimental and theoretical studies around a single complex task” so as to demonstrate that our theories of human cognition were powerful enough to explain “a genuine slab of human behavior” with the studies fitting into a detailed theoretical picture. Action games represent the type of experimental paradigm that Newell was advocating and the current state of programming expertise and laboratory equipment, along with the emergence of Big Data and naturally occurring datasets, provide the technologies and data needed to realize his vision. Action games enable us to escape from our field's regrettable focus on novice performance to develop theories that account for the full range of expertise through a twin focus on expertise sampling (across individuals) and longitudinal studies (within individuals) of simple and complex tasks.

abstract={The study presented in this paper investigates companies operating in the UK video-game industry with regard to their levels of survivability. Using a unique dataset of companies founded between 2009 and 2014, and combining elements and theories from the fields of Organisational Ecology and Industrial Organisation, the authors develop a set of hierarchical logistic regressions to explore and examine the effects of a range of variables such as industry concentration, market size and density on companies' survival rates. The analysis addresses locational dimension of the video-game industry is considered by introducing an extra regionally-related variable into the models, associated with the number of video-game university programmes locally available. In addition, companies are investigated with regard to their organisational type in order to identify potential effects associated with their intrinsic organisational structures. Findings from the analysis confirm that UK video-game companies operate in an increasingly globalised market, limiting the effects related to any operation conducted at a local level. For instance, a higher supply of specialised graduates within spatial proximity does not contribute significantly to increase the chances of survivability of video-game companies, although different locations seem to provide better conditions and higher life expectancy, mainly due to positive network effects occurring at a local level. Results seem also to suggest that investing in managerial resources increases businesses' survival rates, corroborating evidence about the significant role entrepreneurs have for companies operating within innovative and technologically intensive industries. © 2016},

abstract={We introduce a game of trusted computation in which a sensor equipped with limited computing power leverages a central computer to evaluate a specified function over a large dataset, collected over time. We assume that the central computer can be under attack and we propose a strategy where the sensor retains a limited amount of the data to counteract the effect of attack. We formulate the problem as a two player game in which the sensor (defender) chooses an optimal fusion strategy using both the non-trusted output from the central computer and locally stored trusted data. The attacker seeks to compromise the computation by influencing the fused value through malicious manipulation of the data stored on the central computer. We first characterize all Nash equilibria of this game, which turn out to be dependent on parameters known to both players. Next we adopt an Iterated Best Response (IBR) scheme in which, at each iteration, the central computer reveals its output to the sensor, who then computes its best response based on a linear combination of its private local estimate and the untrusted third-party output. We characterize necessary and sufficient conditions for convergence of the IBR along with numerical results which show that the convergence conditions are relatively tight. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Through the use of brain–computer interfaces (BCIs), neurogames have become increasingly more advanced by incorporating immersive virtual environments and 3D worlds. However, training both the user and the system requires long and repetitive trials resulting in fatigue and low performance. Moreover, many users are unable to voluntarily modulate the amplitude of their brain activity to control the neurofeedback loop. In this study, we are focusing on the effect that gaming experience has in brain activity modulation as an attempt to systematically identify the elements that contribute to high BCI control and to be utilized in neurogame design. Based on the current literature, we argue that experienced gamers could have better performance in BCI training due to enhanced sensorimotor learning derived from gaming. To investigate this, two experimental studies were conducted with 20 participants overall, undergoing 3 BCI sessions, resulting in 88 EEG datasets. Results indicate (a) an effect from both demographic and gaming experience data to the activity patterns of EEG rhythms, and (b) increased gaming experience might not increase significantly performance, but it could provide faster learning for ‘Hardcore’ gamers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The three-dimensional (3D) modeling and recognition of 3D objects have been traditionally performed using local features to represent the underlying 3D surface. Extraction of features requires cropping of several local surface patches around detected keypoints. Although an important step, the extraction and representation of such local patches adds to the computational complexity of the algorithms. This paper proposes a novel Keypoints-based Surface Representation (KSR) technique. The proposed technique has the following two characteristics: (1) It does not rely on the computation of features on a small surface patch cropped around a detected keypoint. Rather, it exploits the geometrical relationship between the detected 3D keypoints for local surface representation. (2) KSR is computationally efficient, requiring only seconds to process 3D models with over 50,000 points with a MATLAB implementation. Experimental results on the UWA and Stanford 3D models dataset suggest that it can accurately perform pairwise and multiview range image registration (3D modeling). KSR was also tested for 3D object recognition with occluded scenes. Recognition results on the UWA dataset show that the proposed technique outperforms existing methods including 3D-Tensor, VD-LSD, keypoint-depth based feature, spherical harmonics and spin image with a recognition rate of 95.9%. The proposed approach also achieves a recognition rate of 93.5% on the challenging Ca'Fascori dataset compared to 92.5% achieved by game-theoretic. The proposed method is computationally efficient compared to state-of-the-art local feature methods. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Despite their important position in the research environment, there is a growing theoretical uncertainty concerning what research metrics indicate (e.g., quality, impact, attention). Here we utilize the same tools used to study latent traits like Intelligence and Personality to get a quantitative understanding of what over 20 common research metrics indicate about the papers they represent. The sample is all of the 32,962 papers PLoS published in 2014, with results suggesting that there are at least two important underlying factors, which could generally be described as Scientific Attention/Discussion (citations), General Attention/Discussion (views, tweets), and potentially Media Attention/Discussion (media mentions). The General Attention metric is correlated about.50 with both the Academic and Media factors, though the Academic and Media attention are only correlated with each other below.05. The overall best indicator of the dataset was the total lifetime views on the paper, which is also probably the easiest to game. The results indicate the need for funding bodies to decide what they value and how to measure it (e.g., types of attention, quality). © 2017, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary.},

abstract={Zooarcheological research is an important tool in reconstructing subsistence, as well as for inferring relevant aspects regarding social behavior in the past. The organization of hunting parties, forms of predation (number and rate of animals slaughtered), and the technology used (tactics and tools) must be taken into account in the identification and classification of hunting methods in prehistory. The archeological recognition of communal hunting reflects an interest in evolutionary terms and their inherent implications for anticipatory capacities, social complexity, and the development of cognitive tools, such as articulated language. Late and Middle Paleolithic faunal assemblages in Europe have produced convincing evidence of communal hunting of large ungulates allowing for the formation of hypotheses concerning the skills of Neanderthals anatomically modern humans as social predators. However, the emergence of this cooperative behavior is not currently understood. Here, faunal analysis, based on traditional/long-established zooarcheological methods, of nearly 25,000 faunal remains from the “bison bone bed” layer of the TD10.2 sub-unit at Gran Dolina, Atapuerca (Spain) is presented. In addition, other datasets related to the archeo-stratigraphy, paleo-landscape, paleo-environmental proxies, lithic assemblage, and ethno-archeological information of communal hunting have been considered in order to adopt a holistic approach to an investigation of the subsistence strategies developed during deposition of the archeological remains. The results indicate a monospecific assemblage heavily dominated by axial bison elements. The abundance of anthropogenic modifications and the anatomical profile are in concordance with early primary access to carcasses and the development of systematic butchering focused on the exploitation of meat and fat for transportation of high-yield elements to somewhere out of the cave. Together with a catastrophic and seasonal mortality pattern, the results indicate the procurement of bison by communal hunting as early as circa 400 kyr. This suggests that the cognitive, social, and technological capabilities required for successful communal hunting were at least fully developed among the pre-Neanderthal paleodeme of Atapuerca during the Lower Paleolithic. Similarly, the early existence of mass communal hunting as a predation technique informs our understanding of the early emergence of predatory skills similar to those exhibited by modern communal hunters. Resumen La zooarqueología es una importante herramienta para la reconstrucción de la subsistencia y también para inferir aspectos relevantes del comportamiento social en el pasado. En este trabajo presentamos el análisis faunístico del llamado “lecho de huesos de bisonte”, contenido en la subunidad TD10.2 del yacimiento Gran Dolina (Atapuerca, España). La composición taxonómica y perfil anatómico indican un conjunto monoespecífico fuertemente dominado por elementos del esqueleto axial de bisonte (Bison sp.). Las características y abundancia de las modificaciones antrópicas revelan un acceso primario e inmediato a las carcasas, así como el desarrollo de un procesado carnicero sistemático dirigido a la explotación de la carne y grasa, y a la preparación para el transporte de elementos de alto rendimiento hacia algún lugar fuera de la cavidad. Esas características unidas a un perfil de mortalidad catastrófico y estacional, sugieren la obtención de los bisontes mediante caza comunal. La frecuencia, localización e intensidad de las mordeduras de carnívoro en los restos indica un fuerte saqueo de las carcasas de bisonte una vez abandonadas éstas por los homininos en el yacimiento. La suma de decisiones antrópicas sobre el transporte y el posterior saqueo por carnívoros de los despojos abandonados resulta en un conjunto interpretado como lugar de matanza y procesamiento carnicero de bisontes carroñeados posteriormente por las fieras. Las analogías etnográficas, etnohistóricas y arqueológicas nos han permitido interpretar el “lecho de huesos de bisonte” como cazadero utilizado durante varios eventos estacionales de caza comunal en los que rebaños completos de bisontes fueron sacrificados para ser explotados intensamente por los homininos que ocuparon la cueva. El repetido uso estacional de un punto en el territorio para el desarrollo de tareas específicas muestra ciertas similitudes con el patrón logístico de gestión de los recursos. En el mismo sentido, la existencia temprana de la caza comunal como táctica depredatoria nos informa sobre la emergencia de habilidades cognitivas, tecnológicas y sociales similares a aquellas exhibidas por otros cazadores comunales modernos en un momento tan temprano como el Pleistoceno medio. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

Until now neural networks have not been capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks that they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on a hand-written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.},

The Markov Game formalism uses machine learning and AI techniques to incorporate context and look-ahead. Dynamic programming is applied to learn value functions that quantify the impact of actions on goal scoring. Learning is based on a massive new dataset, from SportLogiq, that contains over 1.3M events in the National Hockey League. The SportLogiq data include the location of an action, which has previously been unavailable in hockey analytics. We give examples showing how the model assigns context and location aware values to a large set of 13 action types. Team performance can be assessed as the aggregate value of actions performed by the team’s players, or the aggregate value of states reached by the team. Model validation shows that the total team action and state value both provide a strong indicator predictor of team success, as measured by the team’s average goal ratio. © 2017 The Author(s)},

abstract={Emotion classification and recognition from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have been studied extensively due to its potential benefits such as entertainment and health care. Concerning classification, various techniques have been developed and applied. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) has been reported as the most used because of its accuracy. Nevertheless, although SVMs has satisfactory performance, it is unable to provide explanation of the relationships between a model's inputs and outputs. Specifically, it is desirable for a medical application for diagnosis to provide comprehensible rules. Consequently, SVM might not be suitable. In this study, SVM is treated as a black-box and then rules are extracted using the Classification And Regression Trees (CART) approach. A dataset from the Database for Emotion Analysis using Physiological Signals (DEAP) is used in this study. The experimental results show that although a classic SVM model has provided the best accuracy, a rule extraction model from SVM output by CART (SVM-CART) is better than a basic CART model. Therefore, the proposed SVM-CART approach is suitable for applications which need explanations and comprehensibility, such as medical applications. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this paper we play the role of an external observer that tries to predict who is going to win from the events occurring during the game. In order to predict the outcome of the game, we model the game states using influence maps. Influence maps are numerical matrices representing the influence of each player's army in the map, and they are useful for different types of spatial reasoning. We test different machine learning techniques on two different datasets of StarCraft games. The first dataset contains 4-player games in which the players are controlled by the internal game AI. The second dataset contains 2-player human games from specialized websites. We analyze the similarities and differences between both datasets and the performance of each algorithm. Finally, we perform a small experiment with expert players and conclude that our system reaches a level of precision similar to the human judges, although human judges base their predictions on a much more complex and abstract set of game features. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) used to be applied to finance, engineering, material design, and decision-making management in past research, but seldom to predict educational learning performance. In recent research, gamification learning material design is often applied to reinforce learning performance, while the prediction of gamification learning performance is seldom discussed. This study therefore applies Rough set theory to extract Core Set and generating rule, ANFIS for learning achievement predication. In order to evaluate the performance of proposed model, the VCCSEGLS dataset are collected as experimental dataset and compared with other models. The results show that the proposed method outperforms the listing models in accuracy. The three key factors are extract, (G7) Time spent on game-based learning, (L1) Examination, normal drugs and treatment, and (L2) Integration ability (time scoring, stability scoring, strain capacity, completeness scoring).The proposed model also can offer accurate predictions and provide some simple decision rules, which can be accurately used by decision-makers and game designers.},

abstract={Objective: To develop a comprehensive definition to identify work-related burns in the National Burn Repository (NBR) based on multiple fields and describes injuries by occupation. Methods: The NBR, which is an inpatient dataset, was used to compare type and severity of burn injuries by occupation. Results: Using the definition developed for this analysis, 22,969 burn injuries were identified as work-related. In contrast, the single work-related field intended to capture occupational injuries only captured 4696 cases. The highest numbers of burns were observed in construction/extraction, food preparation, and durable goods production occupations. Occupations with a mean total body surface area (TBSA) burned greater than 10% include transportation and material-moving, architecture and engineering, and arts/design/entertainment/sports/media occupations. Conclusions: The NBR dataset should be further utilized for occupational burn injury investigations and multiple fields should be considered for case ascertainment. © Copyright 2017 American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine.},

abstract={Face-based video retrieval has become an active and important branch of intelligent video analysis. Face profiling and matching is a fundamental step and is crucial to the effectiveness of video retrieval. Although many algorithms have been developed for processing static face images, their effectiveness in face-based video retrieval is still unknown, simply because videos have different resolutions, faces vary in scale, and different lighting conditions and angles are used. In this paper, we combined content-based and semantic-based image analysis techniques, and systematically evaluated four mainstream local features to represent face images in the video retrieval task: Harris operators, SIFT and SURF descriptors, and eigenfaces. Results of ten independent runs of 10-fold cross-validation on datasets consisting of TED (Technology Entertainment Design) talk videos showed the effectiveness of our approach, where the SIFT descriptors achieved an average F-score of 0.725 in video retrieval and thus were the most effective, while the SURF descriptors were computed in 0.3 seconds per image on average and were the most efficient in most cases. © 2017.

abstract={Topic modeling aims to uncover hidden thematic structures in a collection of documents by representing them as a set of topics. Automatic knowledge-based topic models are recently introduced to meet the demands of processing large-scale text collections. They are based on automatic extraction of rules from multiple domain corpuses. Generally, the extracted rules are large in number and some thresholds are used to select only a small number of useful rules. There are two shortcomings in this for selecting important rules. Firstly, they are based on fixed thresholds for extracting rules from all domain corpuses. Secondly, the thresholds are predefined or explicitly set by expert opinions and are not based on automated mechanisms. In this article, we address these shortcomings by considering a three-way approach based on rules having strong positive associations, rules having strong negative associations and rules having weak associations. A pair of thresholds defines and controls the three-way partitioning of the rules. It is argued that the domain specific and automated selection of thresholds in the three-way framework may be approached from the viewpoint of a tradeoff between the quantity of rules and the quality of rules. We apply the game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model to implement this tradeoff. Algorithms using the GTRS are introduced for automatically determining the thresholds. Experimental results on Chen2014 dataset suggest an average improvement of 52.82 points in topic coherence by increasing the quantity of rules to 17.93%. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Cheap ubiquitous computing enables the collection of massive amounts of personal data in a wide variety of domains. Many organizations aim to share such data while obscuring features that could disclose personally identifiable information. Much of this data exhibits weak structure (e.g., text), such that machine learning approaches have been developed to detect and remove identifiers from it. While learning is never perfect, and relying on such approaches to sanitize data can leak sensitive information, a small risk is often acceptable. Our goal is to balance the value of published data and the risk of an adversary discovering leaked identifiers. We model data sanitization as a game between 1) a publisher who chooses a set of classifiers to apply to data and publishes only instances predicted as non-sensitive and 2) an attacker who combines machine learning and manual inspection to uncover leaked identifying information. We introduce a fast iterative greedy algorithm for the publisher that ensures a low utility for a resource-limited adversary. Moreover, using five text data sets we illustrate that our algorithm leaves virtually no automatically identifiable sensitive instances for a state-of-the-art learning algorithm, while sharing over 93 percent of the original data, and completes after at most five iterations. © 2016 IEEE.},

The Web of Data is a term used to describe a trend for publishing and interlinking previously disconnected datasets on the Web in order to make them more valuable and useful as a whole. In this paper, we describe an innovative approach that exploits Semantic Web technologies to automatically generate games by reusing Web content. Existing work on automatic game content generation through algorithmic means focuses primarily on a set of parameters within constrained game design spaces such as terrains or game levels, but does not harness the potential of already existing content on the Web for game generation. We instead propose a holistic and more generally-applicable game generation solution that would identify suitable Web information sources and enrich game content with semantic meta-structures. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper proposes a method to help understanding the influence of a game design on player retention. Using Far Cry® 4 data, we illustrate how playtime measures can be used to identify time periods where players are more likely to stop playing. First, we show that a benchmark can easily be performed for every game available on Steam using publicly available data. Then, we introduce how survival analysis can help to model the influence of game variables on player retention. Game environment and player characteristics change over time and tracking systems already store those changes. But existing model which deals with time varying covariate cannot scale on huge datasets produced by video game monitoring. That is why we propose a model that can both deal with time varying covariates and is well suited for big datasets. As a given game variable can have a changing effect over time, we also include time-varying coefficients in our model. We used this survival analysis model to quantify the effect of Far Cry 4 weapons usage on player retention. © 2016 IEEE.},

We investigate two settings: in the supervised feature mapping method, we use labeled datasets about players' behaviour in two games. The goal is to establish a mapping between the features so that the models build on one dataset could be used on the other by simple feature replacement. For the unsupervised transfer learning scenario, our goal is to find a shared space of correlated features based on unlabelled data. The features in the shared space are then used to construct models for one game that directly work on the transferred features of the other game. We implemented and analysed the two approaches and we show that transferring the knowledge of player experience between domains is indeed possible and ultimately useful when studying players' behaviour and when designing user studies. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel approach for human gesture classification on skeletal data is proposed for the application of exergaming in physiotherapy. Unlike existing methods, we propose to use a general classifier like Random Forests to recognize dynamic gestures. The temporal dimension is handled afterwards by majority voting in a sliding window over the consecutive predictions of the classifier. The gestures can have partially similar postures, such that the classifier will decide on the dissimilar postures. This brute-force classification strategy is permitted, because dynamic human gestures show sufficient dissimilar postures. Online continuous human gesture recognition can classify dynamic gestures in an early stage, which is a crucial advantage when controlling a game by automatic gesture recognition. Also, ground truth can be easily obtained, since all postures in a gesture get the same label, without any discretization into consecutive postures. This way, new gestures can be easily added, which is advantageous in adaptive game development. We evaluate our strategy by a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation on a self-captured stealth game gesture dataset and the publicly available Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 Kinect (MSRC-12) dataset. On the first dataset we achieve an excellent accuracy rate of 96.72%. Furthermore, we show that Random Forests perform better than Support Vector Machines. On the second dataset we achieve an accuracy rate of 98.37%, which is on average 3.57% better then existing methods. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The classification of time series data is a challenge common to all data-driven fields. However, there is no agreement about which are the most efficient techniques to group unlabeled time-ordered data. This is because a successful classification of time series patterns depends on the goal and the domain of interest, i.e. it is application-dependent. In this article, we study free-to-play game data. In this domain, clustering similar time series information is increasingly important due to the large amount of data collected by current mobile and web applications. We evaluate which methods cluster accurately time series of mobile games, focusing on player behavior data. We identify and validate several aspects of the clustering: the similarity measures and the representation techniques to reduce the high dimensionality of time series. As a robustness test, we compare various temporal datasets of player activity from two free-to-play video-games. With these techniques we extract temporal patterns of player behavior relevant for the evaluation of game events and game-business diagnosis. Our experiments provide intuitive visualizations to validate the results of the clustering and to determine the optimal number of clusters. Additionally, we assess the common characteristics of the players belonging to the same group. This study allows us to improve the understanding of player dynamics and churn behavior. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a novel hybrid model that exploits the strength of discriminative classifiers along with the representation power of generative models. Our focus is on detecting multimodal events in time varying sequences as well as generating missing data in any of the modalities. Discriminative classifiers have been shown to achieve higher performances than the corresponding generative likelihood-based classifiers. On the other hand, generative models learn a rich informative space which allows for data generation and joint feature representation that discriminative models lack. We propose a new model that jointly optimizes the representation space using a hybrid energy function. We employ a Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) based model to learn a shared representation across multiple modalities with time varying data. The Conditional RBMs (CRBMs) is an extension of the RBM model that takes into account short term temporal phenomena. The hybrid model involves augmenting CRBMs with a discriminative component for classification. For these purposes we propose a novel Multimodal Discriminative CRBMs (MMDCRBMs) model. First, we train the MMDCRBMs model using labeled data by training each modality, followed by training a fusion layer. Second, we exploit the generative capability of MMDCRBMs to activate the trained model so as to generate the lower-level data corresponding to the specific label that closely matches the actual input data. We evaluate our approach on ChaLearn dataset, audio-mocap, as well as the Tower Game dataset, mocap-mocap as well as three multimodal toy datasets. We report classification accuracy, generation accuracy, and localization accuracy and demonstrate its superiority compared to the state-of-the-art methods. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={We investigate in this paper the sharing of energy consumption among service categories in the access of a wireless network. We focus on the fixed component of the energy consumption, which is known to be significantly larger than the load-dependent variable component, and propose its sharing among the service categories based on coalition game concept, the Shapley value. We consider five service categories, two large players: streaming and web browsing, and three smaller ones: download, voice and other minor services, and compare our proposal with two other sharing methods: uniform and proportional which follows the same traffic proportions. Our results, applied on a real dataset extracted from an operational network in Europe, show that our proposal is more fair both towards small services in that it reduces their shares in comparison to the uniform approach and towards larger services as it reduces their shares in comparison with the proportional one. Indeed, our Shapley-based model accommodates both short term network behavior, in which the fixed energy component is independent of the traffic load, and longer term behavior, in which it varies with the load and infrastructure. Uniform sharing accounts only for the short term, and the proportional one only for the longer term. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={People with motor and neurological impairments have little control over parts of their bodies, so they have great difficulty in walking. The development of solutions based on assistive technology dedicated to people with severe motor disabilities can provide accessibility and mobility, the intelligent wheelchair is an example of this type of technology. However, its use without proper training can be dangerous, a wheelchair simulator games can be a good tool for training people with severe disabilities. The EEG signals can be used as a source of information that allows communication between the brain and an intelligent wheelchair. This research aimed to develop a computer model to categorize electroencephalogram signals and control a virtual wheelchair using motor imagery of the left and right wrists, both wrists and both feet. Signs of electroencephalogram were acquired through the eegmmidb database - EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset, captured by the BCI2000 system, and electroencephalogram signal samples from 10 individuals were used to validate the model. The techniques used are promising, making possible its use in three-dimensional simulation environments for intelligent wheelchair controlled by a brain-computer interface. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The Cloud Gaming model emerges with the evolution of the Cloud Computing and communication technologies. Through smartphones, PCs, tablets, consoles and other devices, people can access and use games on demand via data streaming, regardless the computing power of these devices. The Internet is the fundamental way of communication between the device and the game, which is hosted on a environment known as Cloud, enabling a large scale offer. The variety, volume, velocity, value and veracity (Big Data 5Vs) of data that is involved in these Cloud environments exceed the limits of analysis and manipulation of conventional tools, therefore, Big Data platforms are required to handle and interpret this data. The model known as Big Data Analytics is an effective and capable way to, not only work with these data, but understand its meaning, providing inputs for assertive analysis and predictive actions. A method is presented in this study to identify and analyze players' patterns in a virtual environment. With this information, it is possible to optimize user experience, revenue for developers and raise the level of control over the environment. Results are presented based on a dataset of the World of Warcraft game. By using a neural network, it was possible to identify with an average of 91% of accuracy the players' assiduity based on patterns in the game. Using the Hadoop technology and visualization tools on a Cloud based cluster, it was possible to map and identify the players' behaviors as well as their gameplay patterns. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Bartering is a timeless practice that is becoming increasingly popular on the Web. Recommending trades for an online bartering platform shares many similarities with traditional approaches to recommendation, in particular the need to model the preferences of users and the properties of the items they consume. However, there are several aspects that make bartering problems interesting and challenging, specifically the fact that users are both suppliers and consumers, and that the trading environment is highly dynamic. Thus, a successful model of bartering requires us to understand not just users' preferences, but also the social dynamics of who trades with whom, and the temporal dynamics of when trades occur. We propose new models for bartering-based recommendation, for which we introduce three novel datasets from online bartering platforms. Surprisingly, we find that existing methods (based on matching algorithms) perform poorly on real-world platforms, as they rely on idealized assumptions that are not supported by real bartering data. We develop approaches based on Matrix Factorization in order to model the reciprocal interest between users and each other's items. We also find that the social ties between members have a strong influence, as does the time at which they trade, therefore we extend our model to be socially- and temporallyaware. We evaluate our approach on trades covering books, video games, and beers, where we obtain promising empirical performance compared to existing techniques. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={Ensemble methodology has proved to be one of the strongest machine learning techniques. In spite of its huge success, most ensemble methods tend to generate unnecessarily large number of classifiers, which entails an increase in memory storage, computational cost, and even a reduction in the generalization performance of the ensemble. Ensemble selection addresses these shortcomings by searching for a fraction of individual classifiers that performs as good as, or better than the entire ensemble. In this paper, we formulate ensemble selection problem as a coalitional game played on a graph. The proposed game aims at capturing two crucial concepts that affect the performance of an ensemble: accuracy and diversity. Most importantly, it ranks every classifier based on its contribution in keeping a proper balance between these two notions using Shapley value. To demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out experimental comparisons with some major selection techniques based on 35 UCI benchmark datasets. The results reveal that our approach significantly improves the original ensemble and performs better than the other methods in terms of classification accuracy, pruning ratio, and computational cost. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Soccer match attendance is an example of group behavior with noisy context that can only be approximated by a limited set of quantifiable factors. However, match attendance is representative of a wider spectrum of context-based behaviors for which only the aggregate effect of otherwise individual decisions is observable. Modeling of such behaviors is desirable from the perspective of economics, psychology, and other social studies with prospective use in simulators, games, product planning, and advertising. In this paper, we evaluate the efficiency of different neural network architectures as models of context in attendance behavior by comparing the achieved prediction accuracy of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), an Elman recurrent neural network (RNN), a time-lagged feedforward neural network (TLFN), and a radial basis function network (RBFN) against a multiple linear regression model, an autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs, and a naive cumulative mean model. We show that the MLP, TLFN, and RNN are superior to the RBFN and achieve comparable prediction accuracy on datasets of three teams from the English Football League Championship, which indicates weak importance of context transition modeled by the TLFN and the RNN. The experiments demonstrate that all neural network models outperform linear predictors by a significant margin. We show that neural models built on individual datasets achieve better performance than a generalized neural model constructed from pooled data. We analyze the input parameter influences extracted from trained networks and show that there is an agreement between nonlinear and linear measures about the most significant attributes. © 2015, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

abstract={The Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) population in Prince William Sound, Alaska crashed in 1993 and has yet to recover, affecting food web dynamics in the Sound and impacting Alaskan communities. To help researchers design and implement the most effective monitoring, management, and recovery programs, a Bayesian assessment of Prince William Sound herring was developed by reformulating the current model used by the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. The Bayesian model estimated pre-fishery spawning biomass of herring age-3 and older in 2013 to be a median of 19,410 mt (95% credibility interval 12,150-31,740 mt), with a 54% probability that biomass in 2013 was below the management limit used to regulate fisheries in Prince William Sound. The main advantages of the Bayesian model are that it can more objectively weight different datasets and provide estimates of uncertainty for model parameters and outputs, unlike the weighted sum-of-squares used in the original model. In addition, the revised model could be used to manage herring stocks with a decision rule that considers both stock status and the uncertainty in stock status.This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

abstract={The quest for information is one of the most common activity of human beings. Despite the the impressive progress of search engines, not to miss the needed piece of information could be still very tough, as well as to acquire specific competences and knowledge by shaping and following the proper learning paths. Indeed, the need to find sensible paths in information networks is one of the biggest challenges of our societies and, to effectively address it, it is important to investigate the strategies adopted by human users to cope with the cognitive bottleneck of finding their way in a growing sea of information. Here we focus on the case of Wikipedia and investigate a recently released dataset about users' click on the English Wikipedia, namely the English Wikipedia Clickstream. We perform a semantically charged analysis to uncover the general patterns followed by information seekers in the multi-dimensional space of Wikipedia topics/categories. We discover the existence of well defined strategies in which users tend to start from very general, i.e., semantically broad, pages and progressively narrow down the scope of their navigation, while keeping a growing semantic coherence. This is unlike strategies associated to tasks with predefined search goals, namely the case of the Wikispeedia game. In this case users first move from the 'particular' to the universal before focusing down again to the required target. The clear picture offered here represents a very important stepping stone towards a better design of information networks and recommendation strategies, as well as the construction of radically new learning paths. © 2017 Rodi et al.

abstract={The knowledge of protein functions plays an essential role in understanding biological cells and has a significant impact on human life in areas such as personalized medicine, better crops and improved therapeutic interventions. Due to expense and inherent difficulty of biological experiments, intelligent methods are generally relied upon for automatic assignment of functions to proteins. The technological advancements in the field of biology are improving our understanding of biological processes and are regularly resulting in new features and characteristics that better describe the role of proteins. It is inevitable to neglect and overlook these anticipated features in designing more effective classification techniques. A key issue in this context, that is not being sufficiently addressed, is how to build effective classification models and approaches for protein function prediction by incorporating and taking advantage from the ever evolving biological information. In this article, we propose a three-way decision making approach which provides provisions for seeking and incorporating future information. We considered probabilistic rough sets based models such as Game- Theoretic Rough Sets (GTRS) and Information-Theoretic Rough Sets (ITRS) for inducing three-way decisions. An architecture of protein functions classification with probabilistic rough sets based three-way decisions is proposed and explained. Experiments are carried out on Saccharomyces cerevisiae species dataset obtained from Uniprot database with the corresponding functional classes extracted from the Gene Ontology (GO) database. The results indicate that as the level of biological information increases, the number of deferred cases are reduced while maintaining similar level of accuracy. © 2017 Ur Rehman et al.

abstract={It is challenging to get access to datasets related to the physical performance of soccer players. The teams consider such information highly confidential, especially if it covers in-game performance. Hence, most analysis and evaluation of the players' performance do not contain much information on the physical aspect of the game. We propose a novel method to solve this issue by deriving individual and team movements in soccer. We use event-based datasets allowing us to analyze the movement profiles of potentially tens of thousands of players. By analyzing the similarity of players based on their movements we find that C. Ronaldo and Ruben Castro were extremely similar despite having two orders of magnitude in their market values, 29 players are more similar to Ronaldo than the most similar counterpart of Messi based on the consistency and uniqueness of their trajectories, and that teams use an abundance of unique attacking schemes, 8909 unique attacks were launched in the 2012/13 season of the Spanish league. Our study reveals novel, actionable insights for the soccer industry at an unprecedented scale. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose the automatic generation of the ortho-photo data which support realistic scenes for DEM by texture mapping. This ortho-photo data is automatically generated by pattern recognition techniques using Bayesian classifier which uses the features extracted from a DEM and its geo-referenced ortho-photo data as training sets. We defined the various features of each texel such as its height, slope angle, slope direction, surface curvature, hue, saturation and brightness from the training datasets. The proposed method makes possible for mapping texture of a realistic ortho-photo data to virtual terrain data which are unable to take satellite photo or aerial photo. These case are often in of computer game and digital movie area. Also, generating ortho-photo with the enlarged DEM, it does not cause the aliasing from the difference of resolution. It makes very similar images with real photography by shading and efficiently handles ortho-photo data and elevation data occupied enormous storage in cloud computing environment. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={Internet search volumes have been successfully adopted for time series analysis of different phenomena. This empirical paper evaluates the feasibility of search volumes in modeling of weekly video game sales. Building on the theoretical concepts of product life cycle, diffusion, and electronic word-of-mouth advertisement, the empirical analysis concentrates on the hypothesized Granger causality between sales and search volumes. By using a bivariate vector autoregression model with a dataset of nearly a hundred video games, only a few games exhibit such causality to either direction. When correlations are present, these rather occur instantaneously; the current weekly amount of sales tends to mirror the current weekly amount of searches. According to the results, search volumes contribute only a limited additional statistical power for forecasting, however. Besides this statistical limitation, the presented evaluation reveals a number of other limitations for use in practical marketing and advertisement foresight. Internet search volumes continue to provide a valuable empirical instrument, but the value should not be exaggerated for time series modeling of video game sales. © 2017 Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig},

Eight affective components were identified as being the most representative semantic and sentiment-oriented dimensions for our dataset. These components explained 51.2% of the variance of all reviews. A Multivariate Analysis of Variance showed that five of the eight components demonstrated significant differences between positive, negative and neutral game reviews. These five components used as predictors in a Discriminant Function Analysis, were able to classify game reviews into positive, negative and neutral ratings with a 55% accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.},

Facial expression recognition has applications in many fields such as HCI, video games, virtual reality, and analyzing customer satisfaction etc. Proposed system focuses on emotion recognition using facial expressions which are captured by using Intel's RealSense SR300 camera. This camera detects landmarks on the depth image of a face automatically using Software Development Kit (SDK) of RealSense camera. Geometric feature based approach is used for feature extraction. The distance between landmarks is used as features and for selecting an optimal set of features brute force method is used. Proposed system is used Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network algorithm using backpropagation method for classification. The experimental dataset is captured using RealSense SR300 camera.

The project also aimed to capture multi-scaled 3D data from the macroscopic level of airborne surveillance down to the sub millimetre of coloured laser scans. These static scans where used to formulate ways of (re-)animating the figures that are depicted in these ancient rock-art artefacts. The use of motion-capture, hand animation and novel volumetric recording systems lead to complex datasets that we combined in a novel workflow utilizing a real-time game engine as our virtual production studio.

abstract={Today, most endeavours require teamwork by people with diverse skills and characteristics. In managing teamwork, decisions are often made under uncertainty and resource constraints. The strategies and the effectiveness of the strategies different people adopt to manage teamwork under different situations have not yet been fully explored, partially due to a lack of detailed large-scale data. In this paper, we describe a multi-faceted large-scale dataset to bridge this gap. It is derived from a game simulating complex project management processes. It presents the participants with different conditions in terms of team members' capabilities and task characteristics for them to exhibit their decision-making strategies. The dataset contains detailed data reflecting the decision situations, decision strategies, decision outcomes, and the emotional responses of 1,144 participants from diverse backgrounds. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset simultaneously covering these four facets of decision-making. With repeated measurements, the dataset may help establish baseline variability of decision-making in teamwork management, leading to more realistic decision theoretic models and more effective decision support approaches. © The Author(s) 2017.},

abstract={Influence maximization deals with identification of the most influential nodes in a social network given an influence model. In this paper, a game theoretic framework is developed that models a competitive influence maximization problem. A novel competitive influence model is additionally proposed that incorporates user heterogeneity, message content, and network structure. The proposed game-theoretic model is solved using Nash Equilibrium in a real-world dataset. It is shown that none of the well-known strategies are stable and at least one player has the incentive to deviate from the proposed strategy. Moreover, violation of Nash equilibrium strategy by each player leads to their reduced payoff. Contrary to previous works, our results demonstrate that graph topology, as well as the nodes’ sociability and initial tendency measures have an effect on the determination of the influential node in the network. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Vehicular Cyber-Physical System (VCPS) is a new trend in the research of the intelligent transport systems (ITS). In VCPS, vehicles work as a hub of sensors to collect interior and exterior information about the vehicle. Vehicles can use ad-hoc networking or 3G/LTE communication technology to share useful information with their neighboring vehicles or with the infrastructures to accomplish user safety, comfort, and entertainment tasks. In order to facilitate efficient sensor-services fusion in the VCPS applications, we need real life vehicular sensory datasets. While there has been many datasets containing vehicle mobility traces, there is hardly any that contains sensory information to be shared on the network. In this paper, we present a scenario specific modular dataset architecture along with some multi-sensory dataset modules. One of the dataset modules provides time synchronized multi-vehicle data including multi-view video, multi-directional sound, GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetic field sensors. Each of the three vehicles recorded front, back, left, and right videos while moving closely in the suburban areas to let explore vehicular cooperative applications. Another module presents necessary tools and datasets to identify vehicular events such as acceleration, deceleration, turn, and no-turn events. We also present development details of a safety application using the presented datasets along with a list of other possible applications. © 2016 IEEE.},

With these datasets, we first establish what could be learned during the event that mimics larger projects in the same domain. Secondly, we compare the events to help bring awareness to strategies that can evolve as specific events occur.

abstract={The Internet has witnessed the proliferation of applications and services that rely on HTTP as application protocol. Users play games, read emails, watch videos, chat and access web pages using their PC, which in turn downloads tens or hundreds of URLs to fetch all the objects needed to display the requested content. As result, billions of URLs are observed in the network. When monitoring the traffic, thus, it is becoming more and more important to have methodologies and tools that allow one to dig into this data and extract useful information. In this paper, we present CLUE, Clustering for URL Exploration, a methodology that leverages clustering algorithms, i.e., unsupervised techniques developed in the data mining field to extract knowledge from passive observation of URLs carried by the network. This is a challenging problem given the unstructured format of URLs, which, being strings, call for specialized approaches. Inspired by text-mining algorithms, we introduce the concept of URL-distance and use it to compose clusters of URLs using the well-known DBSCAN algorithm. Experiments on actual datasets show encouraging results. Well-separated and consistent clusters emerge and allow us to identify, e.g., malicious traffic, advertising services, and third-party tracking systems. In a nutshell, our clustering algorithm offers the means to get insights on the data carried by the network, with applications in the security or privacy protection fields. © 2016 ITC.},

abstract={The Gomoku board game is a longstanding challenge for artificial intelligence research. With the development of deep learning, move prediction can help to promote the intelligence of board game agents as proven in AlphaGo. Following this idea, we train deep convolutional neural networks by supervised learning to predict the moves made by expert Gomoku players from RenjuNet dataset. We put forward a number of deep neural networks with different architectures and different hyperparameters to solve this problem. With only the board state as the input, the proposed deep convolutional neural networks are able to recognize some special features of Gomoku and select the most likely next move. The final neural network achieves the accuracy of move prediction of about 42% on the RenjuNet dataset, which reaches the level of expert Gomoku players. In addition, it is promising to generate strong Gomoku agents of human-level with the move prediction as a guide. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This study employs the dataset collected for the assessment of a post-harvest technology project in rural Cambodia and focuses on the heterogeneous preferences of project implementers, frequently overlooked in the literature on programme evaluation studies. We focus on the ‘implementer effect’ on the programme participation of the treated farmers. We demonstrate that the heterogeneous programme participation of ordinary farmers could be induced due to heterogeneity in the characteristics of the project staff. In particular, we indicate that the baseline altruism of the project staff, measured by the dictator game, consistently increases the participation rate and the number of participations in the training sessions of beneficiaries. This type of heterogeneity in project staffs’ preferences across treatment sites could be a source of treatment heterogeneity for programmes conducted at a certain cluster level. While few studies have focused on the heterogeneity of programme implementers, our empirical results indicate that the preference of implementers could be a source of treatment heterogeneity and imply the importance of implementation of an actual project. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

abstract={To design a successful Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) game, the ratio of snowballing and comeback occurrences to all matches played must be maintained at a certain level to ensure its fairness and engagement. Although it is easy to identify these two types of occurrences, game developers often find it difficult to determine their causes and triggers with so many game design choices and game parameters involved. In addition, the huge amounts of MOBA game data are often heterogeneous, multi-dimensional and highly dynamic in terms of space and time, which poses special challenges for analysts. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system to help game designers find key events and game parameters resulting in snowballing or comeback occurrences in MOBA game data. We follow a user-centered design process developing the system with game analysts and testing with real data of a trial version MOBA game from NetEase Inc. We apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established ones to depict the evolution of players' positions, status and the occurrences of events. Our system can reveal players' strategies and performance throughout a single match and suggest patterns, e.g., specific player' actions and game events, that have led to the final occurrences. We further demonstrate a workflow of leveraging human analyzed patterns to improve the scalability and generality of match data analysis. Finally, we validate the usability of our system by proving the identified patterns are representative in snowballing or comeback matches in a one-month-long MOBA tournament dataset. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this work we propose a game theoretic model for document clustering. Each document to be clustered is represented as a player and each cluster as a strategy. The players receive a reward interacting with other players that they try to maximize choosing their best strategies. The geometry of the data is modeled with a weighted graph that encodes the pairwise similarity among documents, so that similar players are constrained to choose similar strategies, updating their strategy preferences at each iteration of the games. We used different approaches to find the prototypical elements of the clusters and with this information we divided the players into two disjoint sets, one collecting players with a definite strategy and the other one collecting players that try to learn from others the correct strategy to play. The latter set of players can be considered as new data points that have to be clustered according to previous information. This representation is useful in scenarios in which the data are streamed continuously. The evaluation of the system was conducted on 13 document datasets using different settings. It shows that the proposed method performs well compared to different document clustering algorithms. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={This paper fills a literature gap by investigating the strategic interactions between an attacker and a defender with a multi-period multi-target game. At each period, the defender allocates a limited amount of defensive resources over multiple targets, and the attacker assigns some attack probabilities to those targets. We consider four scenarios where the defender could be either myopic or long-sighted, and the defense could be carried over to future periods or not. Our analyses characterize the defender's optimal allocations in these four scenarios and develop a n algorithm to identify the optimal allocations. We find that increases in defense carryover could lead to less allocation to defended targets from the second period at equilibrium, and lead to defending more targets. To gather empirical evidence regarding one key function of the model - success probability of attack, we conduct statistical analysis based on datasets from Global Terrorism Database, which is provided by National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) and the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant allocations from FY 2004 to FY 2012. We conclude that in general, effects of defense resources on reducing success probability of attack are mixed due to scarcity of terrorism data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Intransitivity is a critical issue in pairwise preference modeling. It refers to the intransitive pairwise preferences between a group of players or objects that potentially form a cyclic preference chain, and has been long discussed in social choice theory in the context of the dominance relationship. However, such multifaceted intransitivity between players and the corresponding player representations in high dimension are difficult to capture. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model that joint learns the d-dimensional representation (d&gt;1) for each player and a dataset-specific metric space that systematically captures the distance metric in ℝd over the embedding space. Interestingly, by imposing additional constraints in the metric space, our proposed model degenerates to former models used in intransitive representation learning. Moreover, we present an extensive quantitative investigation of the wide existence of intransitive relationships between objects in various real-world benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of this type. The predictive performance of our proposed method on various real-world datasets, including social choice, election, and online game datasets, shows that our proposed method outperforms several competing methods in terms of prediction accuracy. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={In recent years, vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) have received significant interests from both academia and industry because of the ubiquitous communication capabilities they provide. VANETs are expected to support a wide range of applications that may influence our daily life, ranging from road safety applications to entertainment ones. A key to the development of protocols and algorithms for intervehicle communication and services lies in the knowledge of the structural properties of the VANET communication graph. Nonetheless, previous researches represented the VANET communication graph as a set of snapshots and tracked the evolution of some metrics on snapshots at certain time intervals. They neglected to take into account the temporal property of VANETs, which in many real scenarios plays a pivotal role. In this paper, we mainly explore the temporal structural characteristics of VANETs. A time-extended model is first presented to capture the temporal property of VANETs. Based on the model, some key metrics are defined to describe the structural characteristics of VANETs in various aspects. We then employ a real and large-scale urban taxi GPS dataset to provide a comprehensive study of the temporal structural characteristics involved with time-ordered paths, reachability, and connectivity of VANETs. These results are helpful in designing better protocols and algorithms to achieve reliable and low-latency communications. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Digital videos, nowadays, are becoming more common in various fields like education, entertainment, etc. due to increased computational power and electronic storage capacity. With an increasing size of video collection, a technology is needed to effectively and efficiently browse through the video without losing contents of the video. The user may not always have sufficient time to watch the entire video or the entire content of the video may not be of interest of user. In such cases, user may just want to go through the summary of the video instead of watching the entire video. In this paper we propose an approach for event summarization in videos based on clustering method. Our proposed method provides a set of key frames as a summary for a video.

abstract={Human activity recognition (HAR) is an important research area in the fields of human perception and computer vision due to its wide range of applications. These applications include: intelligent video surveillance, ambient assisted living, human computer interaction, human-robot interaction, entertainment, and intelligent driving. Recently, with the emergence and successful deployment of deep learning techniques for image classification, researchers have migrated from traditional handcrafting to deep learning techniques for HAR. However, handcrafted representation-based approaches are still widely used due to some bottlenecks such as computational complexity of deep learning techniques for activity recognition. However, approaches based on handcrafted representation are not able to handle complex scenarios due to their limitations and incapability; therefore, resorting to deep learning-based techniques is a natural option. This review paper presents a comprehensive survey of both handcrafted and learning-based action representations, offering comparison, analysis, and discussions on these approaches. In addition to this, the well-known public datasets available for experimentations and important applications of HAR are also presented to provide further insight into the field. This is the first review paper of its kind which presents all these aspects of HAR in a single review article with comprehensive coverage of each part. Finally, the paper is concluded with important discussions and research directions in the domain of HAR. © 2016 by the authors.},

abstract={Most recommerce providers have moved to a quality-dependent process for the acquisition of used products. They acquire the products via websites at which product holders submit upfront quality statements and receive quality-dependent acquisition prices for their used devices. Motivated by this development of reverse logistics practice, the aim of this study is to analyze the product assessment process of a recommerce provider in detail. To this end, we first propose a sequential bargaining model with complete information which captures the individual behavior of the recommerce provider and the product holder. We determine the optimal strategies of the product holder and the recommerce provider in this game. We find that the resulting strategies lead to an efficient allocation, although the recommerce provider can absorb most of the bargaining potential due to his last mover advantage. In a second step, we relax the assumption of complete information and include uncertainty about the product holder's valuation of the product. We show the trade-off underlying the recommerce provider's optimal counteroffer decision and analyze the optimal strategy, using a logistic regression approach on a real-life dataset of nearly 6,000 product submissions. The results reveal a significant improvement potential, compared to the currently applied strategy. © 2017 Production and Operations Management Society.},

abstract={As library user needs become increasingly nuanced and technical, the lack of adequate metadata to meet user needs is creating a broadening gulf between library catalog functionality and library user expectations. One of the areas where the dearth of metadata is forming barriers is the idea of "series." While traditional bibliographic definitions of "series" have been adequate to meet user needs in the past, their inability to fully encompass more complex media types beyond simple text is forming barriers against the accessibility of non-traditional formats such as video games, artistic works, datasets, and similar information resources. This article explores the concept of "series" both as it is employed in bibliographic cataloging settings and encompasses actual works. The authors review the term's usage and general meaning across a large variety of media types beyond traditional journals and monographs. Examples are developed as counter-examples to the adequacy of the traditional bibliographic view of series. The authors conclude that the library and information science community as a whole needs to engage in a broader discussion of series cataloging practices and suggest alternate accounts of series that view them as aggregations (like collections) or as containers for intellectual content.},

abstract={Currently, Microsoft Kinect, a motion sensing input device, has been developed quickly in research for human gesture recognition. The Kinect integrating into games and Virtual Reality (VR) improves the immersion sense and natural user experience. However, the Kinect is able to accurately measure a user within five meters, while the user must face to the sensor. To solve this problem, this paper develops a wireless Kinect sensor network system to detect users at several viewports. This system utilizes multiple Kinect clients to sense user's gesture information, which is transmitted to a VR managing server for the integration of the distributed sensing datasets. Different from the VR application with a single Kinect, our proposed system is able to support the user's walking around no matter whether he is facing the sensors or not. Meanwhile, we developed a virtual boxing VR game with two Kinects, Samsung Gear VR and Unity3D environment, which verified the effective performance of the proposed system. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017.},

abstract={With the increasing demand for electricity and the advent of smart grids, developed countries are establishing demand side management (DSM) techniques to influence consumption patterns. The use of dynamic pricing strategies has emerged as a powerful DSM tool to optimize the energy consumption pattern of consumers and simultaneously improve the overall efficacy of the energy market. The main objective of the dynamic pricing strategy is to encourage consumers to participate in peak load reduction and obtain respective incentives in return. In this work, a game theory based dynamic pricing strategy is evaluated for Singapore electricity market, with focus on the residential and commercial sector. The proposed pricing model is tested with five load and price datasets to spread across all possible scenarios including weekdays, weekends, public holidays and the highest/lowest demand in the year. Three pricing strategies are evaluated and compared, namely, the half-hourly Real-Time Pricing (RTP), Time-of-Use (TOU) Pricing and Day-Night (DN) Pricing. The results demonstrate that RTP maximizes peak load reduction for the residential sector and commercial sector by 10% and 5%, respectively. Moreover, the profits are increased by 15.5% and 18.7%, respectively, while total load reduction is minimized to ensure a realistic scenario. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={How likely are third parties to intervene in repeated conflicts between adversaries? Can third party intervention redirect competitive interactions toward collectively beneficial cooperation? Does mutual cooperation persist when the third party can no longer intervene in the conflict? To address these theoretically and practically important questions, we introduce the Repeated Peacemaker Game. Adversaries and third parties interacted for 60 game rounds in our incentivized experiment, producing a rich dataset of 7200 decisions. Participants made decisions under one of two conditions: In the Early Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially possible and then became impossible. In the Late Intervention condition, third party intervention was initially impossible and then became possible. Third parties in the Early Intervention condition intervened at high rates and established cooperative norms that outlasted the intervention period, resulting in sustainable cooperation even after intervention was no longer possible. By comparison, third parties in the Late Intervention condition intervened at relatively lower rates, but still effectively promoted cooperation, despite the initial history of competition between adversaries. We find strong evidence for ‘conditional cooperation’, whereby adversaries and third parties reciprocate each other's choices in preceding rounds: Adversaries were more likely to cooperate when third parties intervened in the preceding round; third parties, in turn, were more likely to intervene when one or both adversaries cooperated in the preceding round than if both adversaries competed in the preceding round. These findings help explain when, why, and how third parties promote cooperation in groups. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Automatic image annotation aims at predicting a set of semantic labels for an image. Because of large annotation vocabulary, there exist large variations in the number of images corresponding to different labels (“class-imbalance”). Additionally, due to the limitations of human annotation, several images are not annotated with all the relevant labels (“incomplete-labelling”). These two issues affect the performance of most of the existing image annotation models. In this work, we propose 2-pass k-nearest neighbour (2PKNN) algorithm. It is a two-step variant of the classical k-nearest neighbour algorithm, that tries to address these issues in the image annotation task. The first step of 2PKNN uses “image-to-label” similarities, while the second step uses “image-to-image” similarities, thus combining the benefits of both. We also propose a metric learning framework over 2PKNN. This is done in a large margin set-up by generalizing a well-known (single-label) classification metric learning algorithm for multi-label data. In addition to the features provided by Guillaumin et al. (2009) that are used by almost all the recent image annotation methods, we benchmark using new features that include features extracted from a generic convolutional neural network model and those computed using modern encoding techniques. We also learn linear and kernelized cross-modal embeddings over different feature combinations to reduce semantic gap between visual features and textual labels. Extensive evaluations on four image annotation datasets (Corel-5K, ESP-Game, IAPR-TC12 and MIRFlickr-25K) demonstrate that our method achieves promising results, and establishes a new state-of-the-art on the prevailing image annotation datasets. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

In this paper we have proposed a adaptive feature selector based on game theory and optimization approach for an investigation on the improvement of the detection accuracy and optimal feature subset selection. Particularly, the embedded Shapely Value includes two memetic operators namely include and remove features (or genes) to realize the genetic algorithm (GA) solution. The use of GA for feature selection facilitates quick improvement in the solution through a fine tune search. An extensive experimental comparison on 22 benchmark datasets (both synthetic and microarray) from UCI Machine Learning repository and Kent ridge repository of proposed method and other conventional learning methods such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), J48 (C4.5) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) confirms that the proposed SVEGA strategy is effective and efficient in removing irrelevant and redundant features. We provide representative methods from each of wrapper, filter, conventional GA and show that this novel memetic algorithm – SVEGA yields overall promising results in terms of the evaluation criteria namely classification accuracy, number of selected genes, running time and other metrics over conventional feature selection methods. © 2016},

This paper proposes an efficient iterative framework to solve apictorial jigsaw puzzles of hand shredded content-less pages, using only the shape information. The proposed framework consists of four phases. In the first phase, normalized shape features are extracted from fragment contours. Then, for all possible matches between pairs of fragments transformation parameters for alignment of fragments and three goodness scores are estimated. In the third phase, incorrect matches are eliminated based on the score values. The alignments are refined by pruning the set of pairwise matched fragments. Finally, a modified graph-based framework for agglomerative clustering is used to globally reassemble the page(s). Experimental evaluation of our proposed framework on an annotated dataset of shredded documents shows the efficiency in the reconstruction of multiple contentless pages from arbitrarily torn fragments. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Hand gestures are an integral part of communication. In several scenarios hand gestures play a vital role by virtue of them being the only means of communication. For example hand signals by a traffic policeman, news reader on TV gesturing news for the deaf, signalling in airport for navigating aircrafts, playing games etc. So, there is a need for robust hand pose recognition (HPR) which can find utility in such applications. The existing state-of-the-art methods are challenged due to clutter in the background. We propose a deep learning framework to recognise hand gestures robustly. Specifically we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify hand postures despite variation in hand sizes, spatial location in the image and clutter in the background. The advantage of our method is that there is no need for feature extraction. Without explicitly segmenting foreground the proposed CNN learns to recognise the hand pose even in presence of complex, varying background or illumination. We provide experimental results demonstrating superior performance of the proposed algorithm on state-of-the-art datasets. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2017.},

abstract={This article addresses the problem of creating interactive mixed reality applications where virtual objects interact in images of real world scenarios. This is relevant to create games and architectural or space planning applications that interact with visual elements in the images such as walls, floors and empty spaces. These scenarios are intended to be captured by the users with regular cameras or using previously taken photographs. Introducing virtual objects in photographs presents several challenges, such as pose estimation and the creation of a visually correct interaction between virtual objects and the boundaries of the scene. The two main research questions addressed in this article include, the study of the feasibility of creating interactive augmented reality (AR) applications where virtual objects interact in a real world scenario using the image detected high-level features and, also, verifying if untrained users are capable and motivated enough to perform AR initialization steps. The proposed system detects the scene automatically from an image with additional features obtained using basic annotations from the user. This operation is significantly simple to accommodate the needs of non-expert users. The system analyzes one or more photos captured by the user and detects high-level features such as vanishing points, floor and scene orientation. Using these features it will be possible to create mixed and augmented reality applications where the user interactively introduces virtual objects that blend with the picture in real time and respond to the physical environment. To validate the solution several system tests are described and compared using available external image datasets. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={General wildlife health surveillance is a valuable source of information on the causes of mortality, disease susceptibility and pathology of the investigated hosts and it is considered to be an essential component of early warning systems. However, the representativeness of data from such surveillance programs is known to be limited by numerous biases. The roe deer (Capreolus capreolus capreolus) is the most abundant ungulate and a major game species all over Europe. Yet, internationally available literature on roe deer pathology is scarce. The aims of this study were (1) to provide an overview of the causes of mortality or morbidity observed in roe deer in Switzerland and to assess potential changes in the disease pattern over time; and (2) to evaluate the value and limitations of a long term dataset originating from general wildlife health surveillance. We compiled 1571 necropsy reports of free ranging roe deer examined at the Centre for Fish and Wildlife Health in Switzerland from 1958 to 2014. Descriptive data analysis was performed considering animal metadata, submitter, pathologist in charge, laboratory methods, morphological diagnoses and etiologies. Recurrent causes of mortality and disease pictures included pneumonia, diarrhea, meningoencephalitis, actinomycosis, blunt trauma, predation, neoplasms and anomalies. By contrast, other diagnoses such as fatal parasitic gastritis, suspected alimentary intoxication and reproductive disorders appeared only in earlier time periods. Diseases potentially relevant for other animals or humans such as caseous lymphadenitis (or pseudotuberculosis), salmonellosis, paratuberculosis and listeriosis were sporadically observed. The disease pattern in roe deer from Switzerland was largely in accordance with previous reports. The observed fluctuations were consistent with methodical and/or personnel changes and varying disease awareness. Nevertheless, despite such limitations, the compiled data provide a valuable baseline. To facilitate comparison among studies, we recommend systematically archiving all case documents and fixed tissues and to perform data analyses more regularly and in a harmonized way. © 2017 Pewsner et al.

abstract={The question of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a global ranking over a collection of objects has been of interest for a very long time: be it ranking of online gamers (e.g., MSR's TrueSkill system) and chess players, aggregating social opinions, or deciding which product to sell based on transactions. In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding 'scores' for each object (e.g., player's rating) is of interest for understanding the intensity of the preferences. In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pairwise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are compared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to be its stationary probability under this random walk. To study the efficacy of the algorithm, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model (equivalent to the Multinomial Logit (MNL) for pairwise comparisons) in which each object has an associated score that determines the probabilistic outcomes of pairwise comparisons between objects. In terms of the pairwise marginal probabilities, which is the main subject of this paper, the MNL model and the BTL model are identical. We bound the finite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. In particular, the number of samples required to learn the score well with high probability depends on the structure of the comparison graph. When the Laplacian of the comparison graph has a strictly positive spectral gap, e.g., each item is compared to a subset of randomly chosen items, this leads to dependence on the number of samples that is nearly order optimal. Experimental evaluations on synthetic data sets generated according to the BTL model show that our algorithm performs as well as the maximum likelihood estimator for that model and outperforms other popular ranking algorithms.},

Other than fun, games must be difficult and challenging for eSports professionals but still easy and enjoyable for amateurs. In this article, we consider Multi-player Online Battle Arena games (MOBA) and particularly, 'Defense of the Ancients 2', commonly known simply as DOTA2. In this context, a challenge is to propose data analysis methods and metrics that help players to improve their skills. We design a data mining-based method that discovers strategic patterns from historical behavioral traces: Given a model encoding an expected way of playing (the norm), we are interested in patterns deviating from the norm that may explain a game outcome from which player can learn more efficient ways of playing. The method is formally introduced and shown to be adaptable to different scenarios. Finally, we provide an experimental evaluation over a dataset of 10 000 behavioral game traces. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Reducing user attrition, i.e. churn, is a broad challenge faced by several industries. In mobile social games, decreasing churn is decisive to increase player retention and rise revenues. Churn prediction models allow to understand player loyalty and to anticipate when they will stop playing a game. Thanks to these predictions, several initiatives can be taken to retain those players who are more likely to churn. Survival analysis focuses on predicting the time of occurrence of a certain event, churn in our case. Classical methods, like regressions, could be applied only when all players have left the game. The challenge arises for datasets with incomplete churning information for all players, as most of them still connect to the game. This is called a censored data problem and is in the nature of churn. Censoring is commonly dealt with survival analysis techniques, but due to the inflexibility of the survival statistical algorithms, the accuracy achieved is often poor. In contrast, novel ensemble learning techniques, increasingly popular in a variety of scientific fields, provide high-class prediction results. In this work, we develop, for the first time in the social games domain, a survival ensemble model which provides a comprehensive analysis together with an accurate prediction of churn. For each player, we predict the probability of churning as function of time, which permits to distinguish various levels of loyalty profiles. Additionally, we assess the risk factors that explain the predicted player survival times. Our results show that churn prediction by survival ensembles significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of traditional analyses, like Cox regression. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to create an 'in-the-wild' dataset of facial emotions with large number of balanced samples, this paper proposes a game-based data collection framework. The framework mainly include three components: a game engine, a game interface, and a data collection and evaluation module. We use a deep learning approach to build an emotion classifier as the game engine. Then a emotion web game to allow gamers to enjoy the games, while the data collection module obtains automatically-labelled emotion images. Using our game, we have collected more than 15,000 images within a month of the test run and built an emotion dataset 'GaMo'. To evaluate the dataset, we compared the performance of two deep learning models trained on both GaMo and CIFE. The results of our experiments show that because of being large and balanced, GaMo can be used to build a more robust emotion detector than the emotion detector trained on CIFE, which was used in the game engine to collect the face images. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, we address the issue of recognizing human actions with low observational latency, which is vital for many applications such as virtual reality and interactive entertainment. Then our purpose is to achieve competitive action recognition performance from very short video clips. Such a task essentially is challenging because only very limited information is provided. To this end, we first develop a feature extraction method to exploit both motion (local flow) and appearance (local shape) features such that the information insufficiency can be effectively mitigated. Then we propose an action representation method named Part Movement Model (PMM), which explicitly captures the spatial-temporal structure of human actions and divides the actions into discriminative part movements. Consequently, the actions can be better represented and the competitive performance can be achieved although only short clips are used. Finally, we experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed method on three benchmark datasets. The results show that short clips of 6−7 frames (0.2−0.3 second video) are enough to achieve the recognition performance comparable to the baselines with high latency. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={In the era of mobile Internet, mobile game apps (i.e., applications) enable users to play games on mobile devices anywhere at any time. Such a change has brought a dramatic revolution to the traditional gaming industry. In this paper, we aim at having a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem of mobile game apps. To this purpose, we conduct a large-scale measurement study over all game apps hosted by four leading app stores in China, which cover both Android and iOS platforms. We collect information of over 75000 mobile game apps in a period of three months (October 2014-January 2015). With obtained datasets, we study the scale, evolution, and overlap of game apps in different app stores from a macroscopic level. We find that none of major app stores can provide a complete set of all game apps. We also investigate download patterns of mobile game apps and the impacts brought by user comments and ratings. We observe clear Pareto effect and power-law effect for game app downloads, and there is no strong positive correlation between app score and the number of its downloads. Last, we characterize the features of popular and unpopular game apps and confirm the negative impacts of embedded ads and paid items. We believe our measurement results can provide useful insights and advice for users, developers, and app store operators. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Signature-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are employed to monitor computer networks for signs of network intrusions. However, they produce a large number of false positive alarms when operated with default settings without considering the underlying network environment. Inundation of false alarms is the Achilles heel of IDS technology, which could render the IDS ineffective in detecting network attacks. Several false alarm minimization approaches have been proposed in the literature. However, there are many drawbacks associated with these works, namely, modification of well-established attack signatures; heavy dependence on the attack signatures' reference numbers, which might not always be available; and non-consideration of the underlying network context information. In this paper, we propose an efficient game theory-based false alarm minimization scheme for signature-based IDS. The proposed scheme uses a game theory-based correlation engine to correlate IDS alarms with network vulnerabilities to minimize the overall false positive alarm rate of the IDS. Experimental results and comparison analysis of the proposed false alarm minimization framework with other frameworks on the benchmark DARPA intrusion detection evaluation dataset and an in-house IIT Guwahati Lab dataset show that the proposed scheme achieves the highest accuracy among all the frameworks under consideration without degrading the overall detection rate of the IDS.

abstract={Predicting content going viral in social networks is attractive for viral marketing, advertisement, entertainment, and other applications, but it remains a challenge in the big data era today. Previous works mainly focus on predicting the possible popularity of content rather than the timing of reaching such popularity. This work proposes a novel yet practical iterative algorithm to predict virality timing, in which the correlation between the timing and growth of content popularity is captured by using its own big data naturally generated from users' sharing. Such data is not only able to correlate the dynamics and associated timings in social cascades of viral content but also can be useful to self-correct the predicted timing against the actual timing of the virality in each iterative prediction. The proposed prediction algorithm is verified by datasets from two popular social networks-Twitter and Digg-as well as two synthesized datasets with extreme network densities and infection rates. With about 50% of the required content virality data available (i.e., halfway before reaching its actual virality timing), the error of the predicted timing is proven to be bounded within a 40% deviation from the actual timing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that predicts content virality timing iteratively by capturing social cascades dynamics. © 2016 ACM 1551-6857/2016/12-ART2 $15.00.},

abstract={Background: The increasing use of computers in science allows for the scientific analyses of large datasets at an increasing pace. We provided examples and interactive demonstrations at Dundee Science Centre as part of the 2015 Women in Science festival, to present aspects of computational science to the general public. We used low-cost Raspberry Pi computers to provide hands on experience in computer programming and demonstrated the application of computers to biology. Computer games were used as a means to introduce computers to younger visitors. The success of the event was evaluated by voluntary feedback forms completed by visitors, in conjunction with our own self-evaluation. This work builds on the original work of the 4273π bioinformatics education program of Barker et al. (2013, BMC Bioinform. 14:243). 4273π provides open source education materials in bioinformatics. This work looks at the potential to adapt similar materials for public engagement events. Results: It appears, at least in our small sample of visitors (n = 13), that basic computational science can be conveyed to people of all ages by means of interactive demonstrations. Children as young as five were able to successfully edit simple computer programs with supervision. This was, in many cases, their first experience of computer programming. The feedback is predominantly positive, showing strong support for improving computational science education, but also included suggestions for improvement. Conclusions: Our conclusions are necessarily preliminary. However, feedback forms suggest methods were generally well received among the participants; “Easy to follow. Clear explanation” and “Very easy. Demonstrators were very informative.” Our event, held at a local Science Centre in Dundee, demonstrates that computer games and programming activities suitable for young children can be performed alongside a more specialised and applied introduction to computational science for older visitors. © 2016, McDonagh et al.},

abstract={All over the world, people find joy and amusement in playing hand-clapping games such as "Pat-a-cake" and "Slide." Thus, as robots enter everyday human spaces and work together with people, we see potential for them to entertain, engage, and assist humans through cooperative clapping games. This paper explores how data recorded from a pair of commonly available inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn on a human's hands can contribute to the teaching of a handclapping robot. We identified representative hand-clapping activities, considered approaches to classify games, and conducted a study to record hand-clapping motion data. Analysis of data from fifteen participants indicates that support vector machines and Markov chain analysis can correctly classify 95.5% of the demonstrated hand-clapping motions (from ten discrete actions) and 92.3% of the hand-clapping game demonstrations recorded in the study. These results were calculated by withholding a participant's entire dataset for testing, so these results should represent general system behavior for new users. Overall, this research lays the groundwork for a simple and efficient method that people could use to demonstrate hand-clapping games to robots. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Both synthetic static and simulated dynamic 3D scene data is highly useful in the fields of computer vision and robot task planning. Yet their virtual nature makes it difficult for real agents to interact with such data in an intuitive way. Thus currently available datasets are either static or greatly simplified in terms of interactions and dynamics. In this paper, we propose a system in which Virtual Reality and human/finger pose tracking is integrated to allow agents to interact with virtual environments in real time. Segmented object and scene data is used to construct a scene within Unreal Engine 4, a physics-based game engine. We then use the Oculus Rift headset with a Kinect sensor, Leap Motion controller and a dance pad to navigate and manipulate objects inside synthetic scenes in real time. We demonstrate how our system can be used to construct a multi-jointed agent representation as well as fine-grained finger pose. In the end, we propose how our system can be used for robot task planning and image semantic segmentation. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). SA '16, December 05-08 2016.},

abstract={Plants appear to produce an excess of leaves, stems and roots beyond what would provide the most efficient harvest of available resources. One way to understand this overproduction of tissues is that excess tissue production provides a competitive advantage. Game theoretic models predict overproduction of all tissues compared with non-game theoretic models because they explicitly account for this indirect competitive benefit. Here, we present a simple game theoretic model of plants simultaneously competing to harvest carbon and nitrogen. In the model, a plant’s fitness is influenced by its own leaf, stem and root production, and the tissue production of others, which produces a triple tragedy of the commons. Our model predicts (i) absolute net primary production when compared with two independent global datasets; (ii) the allocation relationships to leaf, stem and root tissues in one dataset; (iii) the global distribution of biome types and the plant functional types found within each biome; and (iv) ecosystem responses to nitrogen or carbon fertilization. Our game theoretic approach removes the need to define allocation or vegetation type a priori but instead lets these emerge from the model as evolutionarily stable strategies. We believe this to be the simplest possible model that can describe plant production. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Forest-dwelling grouse, and especially their broods, are highly dependent on forest and vegetation structure. In countries with intense forest management, it follows that the quality of their habitats is directly affected by forestry operations. Therefore, we must know which structural features of forests define a good grouse habitat and how the abundance of these features is affected by the forestry operations. Nowadays, airborne lidar (light detection and ranging) is being frequently used for forest inventories and terrain mapping. These data is becoming more and more publicly available and it holds detailed information about the forests and the vegetation structure; a key component of wildlife habitats. In this study, we integrated lidar data with grouse brood presence/absence data. Through GLMM modelling, we aimed (1) to identify the structural features of forests that mostly determine grouse brood occurrence and (2) to assess how they are affected by forest management. The three species assessed were capercaillie, hazel grouse and black grouse. Depending on species, the brood presence was positively (and significantly) affected by denser shrub layer cover, denser canopy cover, higher canopies, or all of these features. The results indicate that grouse broods are highly susceptible to changes in forest structure. In countries like Finland, game management is almost always implemented in managed forests, which in the light of our results creates a need to integrate habitat management into forest management. Our results suggest that when managing grouse brood habitats, attention should be given to maintain both, protective canopy cover and a good understorey cover. It is fair to assume that the removal of these components will significantly decrease brood occurrence. Further, the study showed that a dataset (lidar) collected more for the purposes of forestry can also be used to study wildlife habitats occurring often in the same forests. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Modeling of 3D objects and scenes have become a common tool in different applied fields from simulation-based design in high-end engineering applications (aviation, civil structures, engine components, etc.) to entertainment (computer-based animation, video-game development, etc.). In Biology and related fields, 3D object modeling and reconstruction provide valuable tools to support the visualization, comparison and even morphometric analysis in both academical and applied tasks. Such computational tools, usually implemented as web-based virtual reality applications, significantly reduce the manipulation of fragile samples, preventing their damage and, even, their complete loss. On the other hand, they allow to take the morphological properties of physical specimens to the digital domain, giving support to common entomology tasks such as characterization, morphological taxonomy and teaching. This paper addresses the problem of producing reliable 3D point clouds from the surface of entomological specimens, based on a proved approach for multi view 3D reconstruction from high resolution pictures. Given the traditional issues of macro-photography for small sized objects (i.e. short depth of field, presence of subtle and complex structures, etc.), a pre-processing protocol, based on focus stacking, supported the generation of enhanced views obtained by an acquisition device specifically designed for this work. The proposed approach has been tested on a sample of six representative subjects from the Entomological Collection of the Centro de Biosistemas, Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano (Colombia). The resulting point clouds exhibit an overall good visual quality for the body structure the selected specimens, while file sizes are portable enough to support web based visualization. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Optimal control is a task where it is desired to determine the inputs of a dynamical system that optimize (minimize or maximize) a specified cost functional, also known as performance index, while satisfying any constraints on behaviour of the system. As the name suggests, inverse optimal control is the opposite of the former one and thus is associated with mining of the cost functional, optimal behaviour of which fits the given results best. In this paper, we present the importance of evolutionary bilevel optimization techniques as a promising approach to solve inverse optimal control problems. Generally, inverse optimal control problems are found to be ill posed which makes them computationally expensive in addition to the associated redundancy with the solution. Inverse optimal control theory works as a stepping stone in figuring out the underlying optimality criteria in a given task. It has several other applications in areas like Markov's Decision Processes and Game Theory. In our work, we solve inverse optimal control problems to retrieve the original functional in optimal control task using metaheuristic based bilevel optimization techniques. The dataset comprising of state variables generated from an optimal control problem is utilized to mine the functional. In the later part of our paper, we formulate a problem of human motion transfer as a bilevel optimization task, and subsequently solve it using a bilevel algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Although basketball games have received broad attention, the forms of game reports and webcast are purely content-based cross-media: texts, videos, snapshots, and performance figures. Analytical narrations of games that seek to compose a complete game from heterogeneous datasets are challenging for general media producers because such a composition is time-consuming and heavily depends on domain experts. In particular, an appropriate analytical commentary of basketball games requires two factors, namely, rich context and domain knowledge, which includes game events, player locations, player profiles, and team profiles, among others. This type of analytical commentary elicits a timely and effective basketball game data visualization made up of different sources of media. Existing visualizations of basketball games mainly profile a particular aspect of the game. Therefore, this paper presents an expressive visualization scheme that comprehensively illustrates NBA games with three levels of details: a season level, a game level, and a session level. We reorganize a basketball game as a sequence of sessions to depict the game states and heated confrontations. We design and implement a live system that integrates multimedia NBA datasets: play-by-play text data, box score data, game video data, and action area data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme with case studies and user feedbacks. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper investigates the utilization of game theory models for automated analysis of hyperspectral imagery fused with other remotely sensed and/or in situ data. The author analyzes two approaches to using strategic, competitive game theory models for groundcover classification, including the application of game theory models to (i) feature-level fusion and (ii) decision fusion for hypertemporal-hyperspectral datasets. Proposed model (i) uses conflict data filtering based on mutual entropy along with the Nash equilibrium as the means to find a steady state solution. Proposed model (ii) utilizes a strategic coalition game, specifically the weighted majority game (WMG). Both models are implemented under the assumption that all players are rational. The author incorporates each of the proposed approaches, (i) and (ii), into a multi-classifier decision fusion (MCDF) system for automated ground cover classification of hyperspectral imagery collected via an unmanned airborne system (UAS) over multiple dates. The paper provides experimental results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed game theoretic approaches, presenting significant improvements over existing methods. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In the last 16 years, more than 200 research articles were published about research-paper recommender systems. We reviewed these articles and present some descriptive statistics in this paper, as well as a discussion about the major advancements and shortcomings and an overview of the most common recommendation concepts and approaches. We found that more than half of the recommendation approaches applied content-based filtering (55 %). Collaborative filtering was applied by only 18 % of the reviewed approaches, and graph-based recommendations by 16 %. Other recommendation concepts included stereotyping, item-centric recommendations, and hybrid recommendations. The content-based filtering approaches mainly utilized papers that the users had authored, tagged, browsed, or downloaded. TF-IDF was the most frequently applied weighting scheme. In addition to simple terms, n-grams, topics, and citations were utilized to model users’ information needs. Our review revealed some shortcomings of the current research. First, it remains unclear which recommendation concepts and approaches are the most promising. For instance, researchers reported different results on the performance of content-based and collaborative filtering. Sometimes content-based filtering performed better than collaborative filtering and sometimes it performed worse. We identified three potential reasons for the ambiguity of the results. (A) Several evaluations had limitations. They were based on strongly pruned datasets, few participants in user studies, or did not use appropriate baselines. (B) Some authors provided little information about their algorithms, which makes it difficult to re-implement the approaches. Consequently, researchers use different implementations of the same recommendations approaches, which might lead to variations in the results. (C) We speculated that minor variations in datasets, algorithms, or user populations inevitably lead to strong variations in the performance of the approaches. Hence, finding the most promising approaches is a challenge. As a second limitation, we noted that many authors neglected to take into account factors other than accuracy, for example overall user satisfaction. In addition, most approaches (81 %) neglected the user-modeling process and did not infer information automatically but let users provide keywords, text snippets, or a single paper as input. Information on runtime was provided for 10 % of the approaches. Finally, few research papers had an impact on research-paper recommender systems in practice. We also identified a lack of authority and long-term research interest in the field: 73 % of the authors published no more than one paper on research-paper recommender systems, and there was little cooperation among different co-author groups. We concluded that several actions could improve the research landscape: developing a common evaluation framework, agreement on the information to include in research papers, a stronger focus on non-accuracy aspects and user modeling, a platform for researchers to exchange information, and an open-source framework that bundles the available recommendation approaches. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Electropherograms are produced in great numbers in forensic DNA laboratories as part of everyday criminal casework. Before the results of these electropherograms can be used they must be scrutinised by analysts to determine what the identified data tells us about the underlying DNA sequences and what is purely an artefact of the DNA profiling process. A technique that lends itself well to such a task of classification in the face of vast amounts of data is the use of artificial neural networks. These networks, inspired by the workings of the human brain, have been increasingly successful in analysing large datasets, performing medical diagnoses, identifying handwriting, playing games, or recognising images. In this work we demonstrate the use of an artificial neural network which we train to ‘read’ electropherograms and show that it can generalise to unseen profiles. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

To detect human silhouette, raw depth data is examined to extract human silhouette by considering spatial continuity and constraints of human motion information. While, frame differentiation is used to track human movements. Features extraction mechanism consists of spatial depth shape features and temporal joints features are used to improve classification performance. Both of these features are fused together to recognize different activities using the modified hidden Markov model (M-HMM). The proposed approach is evaluated on two challenging depth video datasets. Moreover, our system has significant abilities to handle subject’s body parts rotation and body parts missing which provide major contributions in human activity recognition. © The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers.},

abstract={This study aimed to verify the network of interactions resulting from the collective behavior of professional football teams and the influence of ball possession. A dataset of 30 matches of one highly successful team from the Portuguese Premier League, season 2010/2011, was considered. From these 30 matches, 13,958 passes (e.g., 11,127 successfully passes and 2831 unsuccessfully passes) and 7583 collective offensive actions were analysed. The data were analysed using Node XL Template that allows to characterize networks and team activity profiles. The results showed that football players' interactions tended to occur, preferentially, during the offensive phase, wherein the network of contacts was mainly organised in the central and lateral areas of the field. We concluded that the ball possession during a football match endows the team with a larger domain in terms of game actions. Moreover, the results of this study also allow concluding that the ball possession does not significantly influence the final outcome of the game. This study has practical implications for coaches, since it provides a multidimensional analysis of the football match (e.g., networks and ball possession) and offers relevant insights on how creative and organizing individuals might act to orchestrate team strategies. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract={Recent days, real-time 3D visualization is widely required for pervasive games. Despite the use of level-of-detail techniques, the real-time rendering of massive terrain datasets exceeds the capability of today’s graphics hardware. So, to visualize the realistic terrain on various devices, the oversimplification of datasets is required. The oversimplification reduces computing and data transmission time. Owing to the oversimplification, however, artifacts such as geo-popping may appear in rugged regions, particularly when low level-of-detail is involved. Geo-popping is undesirable visual effect that occurs when the transition of a 3D object to a different level of detail is performed. To reduce such artifacts, we propose a novel mesh simplification method by concentrating on the vertices of regular grids in a rugged area using the concept of attraction and elastic forces. Each sampling point of the terrain data may pull on adjacent vertices with an attraction force that corresponds to its predicted surface roughness. However, strong attraction forces may cause a geometrical twisting or overlapping problems. To solve these problems, we apply an elastic force to a vertex and its neighbors. This makes each vertex push its neighbors away when they are too close. Computing the displacement of each vertex using attraction and elastic forces provides a fine-mesh terrain representation in rough areas, and a coarse-mesh representation in smooth areas. As a result, our method efficiently visualizes more accurate terrain scenes by reducing the number of geo-popping that mainly appear in rugged areas. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Automatic image annotation is an important research problem in computer vision. Many existing algorithms integrate multiple types of features of sample images into joint sparse coding framework to achieve better annotation performance. However, joint sparse representation only applies the sparsity to coding coefficients between the rows, which is limited in many cases, and the label information cannot be employed effectively to boost the discriminative power. In this paper, we present a multi-view mixed-norm sparse coding framework for image annotation, which integrates multiple features into sparse coding for multi-view learning problem. We introduce the mixednorm sparsity by combining L1-norm with L1;1-norm regularization together to best represent images. In addition, the label information is considered as an additional view which leads to a simple and direct label transfer scheme. Experimental results on Corel5K and ESP Game datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method compared with the related approaches for image annotation task. © 2016 ICIC International.},

abstract={Aligning heterogeneous online social networks is a highly beneficial task proposed in recent years. It targets at automatically aligning accounts from multiple networks by whether they are held by the same natural person. Aligning the networks can improve personalized services by cross-platform user modeling, and is the prerequisite for cross-network analysis. However, there is currently no public benchmark dataset available due to its recency. As performances of this task depend highly on the dataset, experiments using different private datasets are not directly comparable. Therefore, in this paper we propose ASNets, a benchmark dataset with two sets of aligned social networks. With this dataset, we can now properly evaluate different approaches and compare them fairly. The two sets of aligned networks have 328, 224 and 141, 614 aligned users respectively, covering multilingual usage (Chinese and English) and various types of social networks including general purposed networks, review sites and microblogging sites. We describe the collecting methodology and statistics in details, and evaluate several state-of-the-art network aligning approaches. Beside introducing the dataset, we further propose several potential research directions that benefit from ASNets. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Recent advances in positioning technology have generated massive volume of human mobility data. At the same time, large amount of spatial context data are available and provide us with rich context information. Combining the mobility data with surrounding spatial context enables us to understand the semantics of the mobility records, e.g., what is a user doing at a location (e.g., dining at a restaurant or attending a football game). In this paper, we aim to answer this question by annotating the mobility records with surrounding venues that were actually visited by the user. The problem is non-trivial due to high ambiguity of surrounding contexts. Unlike existing methods that annotate each location record independently, we propose to use all historical mobility records to capture user preferences, which results in more accurate annotations. Our method does not assume the availability to any training data on user preference because of the difficulties to obtain such data in the real-world setting. Instead, we design a Markov random field model to find the best annotations that maximize the consistency of annotated venues. Through extensive experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baseline methods. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={As more and more cyber security incident data ranging from systems logs to vulnerability scan results are collected, manually analyzing these collected data to detect important cyber security events become impossible. Hence, data mining techniques are becoming an essential tool for real-world cyber security applications. For example, a report from Gartner [4] claims that "Information security is becoming a big data analytics problem, where massive amounts of data will be correlated, analyzed and mined for meaningful patterns". Of course, data mining/analytics is a means to an end where the ultimate goal is to provide cyber security analysts with prioritized actionable insights derived from big data. This raises the question, can we directly apply existing techniques to cyber security applications? One of the most important differences between data mining for cyber security and many other data mining applications is the existence of malicious adversaries that continuously adapt their behavior to hide their actions and to make the data mining models ineffective. Unfortunately, traditional data mining techniques are insufficient to handle such adversarial problems directly. The adversaries adapt to the data miner's reactions, and data mining algorithms constructed based on a training dataset degrades quickly. To address these concerns, over the last couple of years new and novel data mining techniques which is more resilient to such adversarial behavior are being developed in machine learning and data mining community. We believe that lessons learned as a part of this research direction would be beneficial for cyber security researchers who are increasingly applying machine learning and data mining techniques in practice. To give an overview of recent developments in adversarial data mining, in this three hour long tutorial, we introduce the foundations, the techniques, and the applications of adversarial data mining to cyber security applications. We first introduce various approaches proposed in the past to defend against active adversaries, such as a minimax approach to minimize the worst case error through a zero-sum game. We then discuss a game theoretic framework to model the sequential actions of the adversary and the data miner, while both parties try to maximize their utilities. We also introduce a modified support vector machine method and a relevance vector machine method to defend against active adversaries. Intrusion detection and malware detection are two important application areas for adversarial data mining models that will be discussed in details during the tutorial. Finally, we discuss some practical guidelines on how to use adversarial data mining ideas in generic cyber security applications and how to leverage existing big data management tools for building data mining algorithms for cyber security. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This study investigated the evolution of game-play manifested via team performance indicator characteristics in the Australian Football League (AFL) from the 2001 to 2015 seasons. The mean values for 18 performance indicators were collated for every AFL team over 15-seasons. A multivariate analysis was used to uncover temporal trends in the dataset. Compared to the 2004 season, the 2005 to 2010 seasons were characterised by large growth in the counts of handballs (d = 0.83; 90% CI = 0.22–1.43), disposals (d = 1.24; 90% CI = 0.59–1.87), uncontested possessions (d = 1.37; 90% CI = 0.71–2.01), clangers (d = 2.14; 90% CI = 1.39–2.86) and marks (d = 1.43; 90% CI = 0.76–2.07). Contrastingly, the effective disposal percentage declined rapidly during the same period. The number of inside 50 m counts remained stable throughout the 15-season period. The ordination plot of league-wide performance indicator characteristics illustrated a distinct cluster from the 2001 to 2004 seasons, an abrupt shift from the 2005 to 2009 seasons, and an emergent (re)stabilisation from the 2010 to 2015 seasons. The results demonstrate the synchronous league-wide evolution of game-play in the AFL from the 2001 to 2015 seasons. Amongst other constituents, this evolution likely reflects the introduction of modernised coaching strategies, rule changes and changing perceptions of rule interpretations. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group},

abstract={Effective data visualisation is a key part of the scientific process with complex geometric datasets. It is the bridge between the quantitative content of the data and human intuition. Immersion in virtual reality (VR) provides benefits beyond the traditional desktop visualization tools and it leads to a demonstrably better perception of dataspace geometry, more intuitive data understanding, and a better retention of the perceived relationships in the data.VR has a great potential for fusion research and in the analysis of its complex physics-based datasets. The work presented in this paper is one of the applications that have been implemented at UKAEA which combines shutdown dose calculations with a virtual reality model of the Joint European Tokamak (JET) in a new code called VORTEX (Virtual Operator RadiaTion EXposure). The shutdown dose calculations were performed for various time steps during the JET DTE2 campaign using the UKAEA code MCR2S which links MCNP and FISPACT-II using the rigorous two step method. The 3 Dimensional dose and activation data created by MCR2S is integrated into the game engine Unity using C# routines to create VORTEX. A virtual reality model has been created from JET CAD data combined with the 3 dimensional radiation and activation data to create of virtual model of the radiological environment after the DTE2 campaign. This model enables more precise planning of operational procedures by having the operator/planner walk around the virtual environment using a virtual reality headset such as the Oculus rift or the HTC vive. © 2017.},

abstract={Point-of-Interest recommendation is an essential means to help people discover attractive locations, especially when people travel out of town or to unfamiliar regions. While a growing line of research has focused on modeling user geographical preferences for POI recommendation, they ignore the phenomenon of user interest drift across geographical regions, i.e., users tend to have different interests when they travel in different regions, which discounts the recommendation quality of existing methods, especially for out-of-town users. In this paper, we propose a latent class probabilistic generative model Spatial-Temporal LDA (ST-LDA) to learn region-dependent personal interests according to the contents of their checked-in POIs at each region. As the users' check-in records left in the out-of-town regions are extremely sparse, ST-LDA incorporates the crowd's preferences by considering the public's visiting behaviors at the target region. To further alleviate the issue of data sparsity, a social-spatial collective inference framework is built on ST-LDA to enhance the inference of region-dependent personal interests by effectively exploiting the social and spatial correlation information. Besides, based on ST-LDA, we design an effective attribute pruning (AP) algorithm to overcome the curse of dimensionality and support fast online recommendation for large-scale POI data. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our ST-LDA model on two real-world and large-scale datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ST-LDA and AP, compared with the state-of-the-art competing methods, by making more effective and efficient mobile recommendations. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The massive growth of sports videos has resulted in a need for automatic generation of sports highlights that are comparable in quality to the hand-edited highlights produced by broadcasters such as ESPN. Unlike previous works that mostly use audio-visual cues derived from the video, we propose an approach that additionally leverages contextual cues derived from the environment that the game is being played in. The contextual cues provide information about the excitement levels in the game, which can be ranked and selected to automatically produce high-quality basketball highlights. We introduce a new dataset of 25 NCAA games along with their play-by-play stats and the ground-truth excitement data for each basket. We explore the informativeness of five different cues derived from the video and from the environment through user studies. Our experiments show that for our study participants, the highlights produced by our system are comparable to the ones produced by ESPN for the same games. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

abstract={This paper considers the small glass objects often called counters, which are common finds at Pompeii, and normally thought to have been used in playing games. An assemblage of over 500 stratigraphically dated examples from Insula VI.1 are examined, and the colour and size of this group are compared to a dataset of first-century ad glass counters found in graves where they can be shown with certainty to be part of gaming sets. The comparisons show that the bulk of the Pompeii counters are very unlikely to have been used in gaming, a conclusion that is supported by the types of counters that would have been necessary to play games such as ludus latrunculorum and ludus duodecim scriptorum. Other functions are considered and it is suggested that many of the Pompeiian counters might have been used for interior decoration. The rise of a specialist production of counters that could have been used in gaming is demonstrated, and it is suggested this might have implications for the development of craft specialization and demonstrate the rise of leisure time in the first century ad. © Copyright 2016 British School at Rome.},

abstract={Strategic users in a wireless network cannot be assumed to follow the network algorithms blindly. Moreover, some of these users aim to use their knowledge about network algorithms to maliciously gain more resources and also to create interference to other users. We consider a scenario, in which the network and legitimate users gather probabilistic information about the presence of malicious users by observing the network over a long time period. The network (mechanism designer) and legitimate users modify their actions according to this Bayesian information. We consider Bayesian mechanisms, both pricing schemes and auctions, and obtain the Bayesian Nash Equilibrium (BNE) points. The BNE points provide conditions under which, the uncertainty about user's nature (type) is better for regular (legitimate) users. To derive these conditions, we compare the Bayesian case to the complete information case. We obtain the optimal prices and allocations, which counter the malicious users. We also provide detection methods based on machine learning algorithms for the detection of malicious users, by observing the prices and rate allocations. In addition, we provide detection using regression learning by observing the anomalies in the utility functions of malicious users from prices, which is implemented along with the pricing mechanism itself. For the designer and the regular users, in a complementary fashion, the results of the detections provide a better estimate of the statistics of malicious users to implement the pricing mechanisms. We have also proposed a truthful Bayesian mechanism in the presence of malicious users. The numerical studies for malicious user detection are carried out with the model proposed in the paper as well as using real Botnet dataset. © 2016 IEEE.},

Recent research on mobility and spatial–temporal data focuses on techniques for improving data availability and reducing latency and access costs through client side data caching techniques. In this paper, we design a cache management system for location dependent information system by considering various contextual information of users such as mobility pattern and the type of service being requested. Cache placement and invalidation is carried out considering the spatial and temporal validity of the services. We also propose a pre-fetching technique which considers the geographical and semantic adjacency of the queried items. The pre-fetching policy rules are derived from applying Weighted Association Rule Mining to determine the secondary service item that should be pre-fetched while processing the primary service query. A new cache replacement algorithm Spatial and Temporal Valid Scope which takes into account the spatial and temporal valid scopes, data distance and service type are applied for eviction. The experimental evaluations using synthetic datasets show that the proposed cache management system is effective in improving the system performance in terms of the cache hit ratio of mobile clients.

abstract={In multimedia applications, compositing is an inevitable step for creating special visual effects from entertainment to education. It is often desirable to merge two regions or an object from one image over background of another image to get a completely new image. However, compositing multiple images with different textures and colors results in the creation of visual artifacts along the boundaries. A multi-scale seamless image compositing method is proposed to minimize these artifacts in order to generate visually appealing and natural looking composites. Unlike existing compositing techniques, the proposed method automatically detects the visually salient objects from the source image for merging it over a destination image background. Novel facets of the algorithm are: (1) use of a novel salient object detection method for automatic mask generation, (2) formulation of a novel 2-D exponentially weighted Savitzky–Golay (2-D EWS–G) filter, which is an extension of 2-D S-G filter, for multi-scale pyramid based blending with edge preserving blurring property. Experiments performed over different datasets are compared with the state-of-the-art methods to justify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. Despite smoothing the seams, our algorithm retains the sharpness of the image features, effectively reduces noise, and is robust to change in window size of the proposed filter. Thus, the proposed algorithm exhibits a considerable improvement in image compositing and hence it could be quite useful for multimedia applications. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={White-tailed deer are a culturally and economically important game species in North America, especially in South Texas. The recent discovery of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in captive deer facilities in Texas has increased concern about the potential emergence of CWD in free-ranging deer. The concern is exacerbated because much of the South Texas region is a semi-arid environment with variable rainfall, where precipitation is strongly correlated with fawn recruitment. Further, the marginally productive rangelands, in combination with erratic fawn recruitment, results in populations that are frequently density-independent, and thus sensitive to additive mortality. It is unknown how a deer population in semi-arid regions would respond to the presence of CWD. We used long-term empirical datasets from a lightly harvested (2% annual harvest) population in conjunction with 3 prevalence growth rates from CWD afflicted areas (0.26%, 0.83%, and 2.3% increases per year) via a multistage partially deterministic model to simulate a deer population for 25 years under four scenarios: 1) without CWD and without harvest, 2) with CWD and without harvest, 3) with CWD and male harvest only, and 4) with CWD and harvest of both sexes. The modeled populations without CWD and without harvest averaged a 1.43% annual increase over 25 years; incorporation of 2% annual harvest of both sexes resulted in a stable population. The model with slowest CWD prevalence rate growth (0.26% annually) without harvest resulted in stable populations but the addition of 1% harvest resulted in population declines. Further, the male age structure in CWD models became skewed to younger age classes. We incorporated fawn:doe ratios from three CWD afflicted areas in Wisconsin and Wyoming into the model with 0.26% annual increase in prevalence and populations did not begin to decline until ∼10%, ∼16%, and ∼26% of deer were harvested annually. Deer populations in variable environments rely on high adult survivorship to buffer the low and erratic fawn recruitment rates. The increase in additive mortality rates for adults via CWD negatively impacted simulated population trends to the extent that hunter opportunity would be greatly reduced. Our results improve understanding of the potential influences of CWD on deer populations in semi-arid environments with implications for deer managers, disease ecologists, and policy makers. © 2016 Foley et al.

Given their proprietary nature, investigations of sponsorship costs are particularly sparse. Therefore, this study utilizes a dataset of more than 700 sponsorships undertaken by competitors in the financial services industry to investigate the influence of a variety of factors on costs. Results indicate that costs are not simply reflective of firm size, and costs of title and naming rights sponsorships are significantly higher. Evidence of agency conflicts are found in increased costs for sponsorships of events, organizations, and venues residing within the marketers’ home market. Sponsorships of sport organizations are significantly more costly than those of arts, entertainment, and nonprofit organizations, presenting a challenge for marketers seeking to engage today’s consumer via sport sponsorships in an increasingly competitive environment. © 2016 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={We investigate in this paper the sharing of energy consumption among service categories in the access of a wireless network. We focus on the fixed part of the energy consumption of the network, which is known to be significantly larger than the load-dependent variable part, and propose its sharing among the service categories based on coalition game concept, the Shapley value. We consider five service categories, two large players: streaming and web browsing, and three smaller ones: download, voice and other minor services, and compare our proposal with two other sharing strategies: uniform and proportional which follows the same volume proportions. Our results, applied on a real dataset extracted from an operational network in Europe, show that our proposal is more fair both towards small services in that it reduces their shares in comparison to the uniform approach, and towards larger services as it reduces their shares in comparison with the proportional one. Indeed, our Shapley-based model accommodates both short term network behavior, in which the fixed energy component is independent of the traffic load, and longer term behavior, in which it varies with the load and infrastructure. Uniform sharing accounts only for the short term, and the proportional one only for the longer term. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={There are two broad categories of citywide human mobility, routine, composed of daily or periodic travel, and rare, which occurs during events such as the Olympic Games or natural disasters. State-of-the-art studies have shown that routine mobility patterns can be modeled stochastically, while rare human mobility modeling, essential to a variety of urban computing scenarios, such as emergency management and traffic regulation, is a much more challenging and understudied problem. Instead of training a rare-event-specific human mobility model, which suffers from the particularity of the rare events, in this paper we provide a new insight into rare events and propose a novel algorithm, CityCoupling, which establishes an intercity spatial mapping that uses human mobility in one city as input and reproduces human mobility in another city. More intuitively, we attempt to answer the question "What if this rare event happened in another city?". To find the optimal intercity spatial mapping, we utilize an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate a probabilistic geographical correspondence matrix by regarding intercity trajectory matching as latent variables. Thereafter, a Gibbs sampling-based multiple hidden Markov model generates simulated trajectories. We apply our approach to a large mobile phone GPS dataset in Japan and determine the spatial mapping between Tokyo and Osaka to transfer the human mobility at the Great Eastern Japan Earthquake in Tokyo, which was heavily affected, to simulate what might have occurred if Osaka had been struck by the earthquake. We conduct the evaluation by assuming that New Year's Countdown is a rare event that occurs simultaneously in both Tokyo and Osaka, and thus we quantitatively compare our simulation with the ground truth in Osaka.},

abstract={An accurate and comprehensive user modeling technique is crucial for the quality of recommender systems. Tradition- ally, we model user preferences using only actions from the target site and may suffer from cold-start problem. As nowa- days people normally engage in multiple online sites for var- ious needs, we consider leveraging the cross-site actions to improve the user modeling accuracy. Specifically, in this paper we aim at achieving a more comprehensive and ac- curate user modeling by modeling user's actions in multiple aligned heterogeneous sites simultaneously. To do so, we propose a modularized probabilistic graphical model frame- work JUMA. We further integrate topic model and matrix factorization into JUMA for joint user modeling over text- based and item-based sites. We assemble and publish large- scale dataset for comprehensive analyzing and evaluation. Experimental results show that our framework JUMA out performs traditional within-site user modeling techniques, especially for cold-start scenarios. For cold-start users, we achieve relative improvements of 9.3% and 12.8% compar- ing to existing within-site approaches for recommendation in item-based and text-based sites respectively. Thus we draw the conclusion that aligning heterogeneous sites and mod- eling users jointly do help to improve the quality of online recommender systems. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Protein sequences are divided into four structural classes. The determination of class is a challenging and beneficial task in the bioinformatics field. Several methods have been proposed to this end, but most utilize too many features and produce unsuitable results. In the present, features are extracted based on the predicted secondary structures. At first, predicted secondary structure sequences are mapped into two time series by the chaos game representation. Then, a recurrence matrix is calculated from each of the time series. The recurrence matrix is identified with the adjacency matrix of a complex network and measures are applied for the characterization of complex networks to these recurrence matrixes. For a given protein sequence, a total of 24 characteristic features can be calculated and these are fed into Fisher's discriminated analysis algorithm for classification. To examine the proposed method, two widely used low similarity benchmark datasets design and test its performance. A comparison with the results of existing methods shows that the current study's approach provides a satisfactory performance for protein structural class prediction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Issues related to group recommendations are increasingly becoming hot research topics. Among the differences between individual and group recommender systems, the most significant is social factors of group users. Social factors, including personality, expertise factor, interpersonal relationships, and preference similarities, widen the gap between group and individual recommendations. A new approach focuses on the impact of social factors on group recommender systemsâa computational model integrating the influences of personality, expertise factor, interpersonal relationships, and preference similarities.

abstract={Subjects in simple games frequently exhibit non-equilibrium behaviors. Cognitive hierarchy (CH) and level k (LK) are two prevailing structural models that capture such behaviors well. This paper proposes a generalized CH (GCH) model that nests a variant of the LK model, called LM. GCH differs from CH in two ways. First, each lower level's actual frequency is exponentially weighted with α to form level-k's belief on relative proportions; α captures stereotype bias. CH assumes no stereotype bias (α=1) and LM assumes extreme bias (α=∞). Second, GCH replaces random choice with minimum aversion for level 0. Level 0s are more likely to choose strategies that never yield the minimum payoff for any of the opponent's strategies. GCH captures behaviors better than CH and LK in fifty-five n×m games from four datasets. Robustness tests using three new games further validate GCHs descriptive strength over CH and LK. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The game of chess has often been used for psychological investigations, particularly in cognitive science. The clear-cut rules and well-defined environment of chess provide a model for investigations of basic cognitive processes, such as perception, memory, and problem solving, while the precise rating system for the measurement of skill has enabled investigations of individual differences and expertise-related effects. In the present study, we focus on another appealing feature of chess—namely, the large archive databases associated with the game. The German national chess database presented in this study represents a fruitful ground for the investigation of multiple longitudinal research questions, since it collects the data of over 130,000 players and spans over 25 years. The German chess database collects the data of all players, including hobby players, and all tournaments played. This results in a rich and complete collection of the skill, age, and activity of the whole population of chess players in Germany. The database therefore complements the commonly used expertise approach in cognitive science by opening up new possibilities for the investigation of multiple factors that underlie expertise and skill acquisition. Since large datasets are not common in psychology, their introduction also raises the question of optimal and efficient statistical analysis. We offer the database for download and illustrate how it can be used by providing concrete examples and a step-by-step tutorial using different statistical analyses on a range of topics, including skill development over the lifetime, birth cohort effects, effects of activity and inactivity on skill, and gender differences. © 2016 The Author(s)},

abstract={Due to the popularity of online video sharing websites such as YouTube, millions of users have treated online video as a source of information and entertainment. Therefore, video annotation has evoked great interest in the past few years. In this paper, we propose a four-step approach to automatically annotate video shots with sentences. The first step is video preprocessing, converting video shot into a sequence of frame images. The second step is to find related candidate elements of the sentence about the video contents. The main elements in the sentence are objects, events, scenes, and modifiers. These candidate elements are gained by searching for similar images with the video frames in our collected image data sets instead of video data sets. The third step is to select the best elements among these candidate ones by a weighted scoring algorithm. The final step is to construct a sentence with the help of a correlation graph algorithm to analyze the relationships among the best elements. The experimental results indicate that our method is effective to annotate videos with sentences. What is more, the weighted scoring algorithm and the correlation graph algorithm that we propose are efficient in developing the experimental performance. © 1991-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Statistical inference using social sensors is an area that has witnessed remarkable progress in the last decade. It is relevant in a variety of applications including localizing events for targeted advertising, marketing, localization of natural disasters and predicting sentiment of investors in financial markets. This paper presents a tutorial description of three important aspects of sensing-based information diffusion in social networks from a communications/ signal processing perspective. First, diffusion models for information exchange in large scale social networks together with social sensing via social media networks such as Twitter is considered. Second, Bayesian social learning models in online reputation systems are presented. Finally, the principle of revealed preferences arising in micro-economics theory is used to parse datasets to determine if social sensors are utility maximizers and then determine their utility functions. All three topics are explained in the context of actual experimental datasets from health networks, social media and psychological experiments. Also, algorithms are given that exploit the above models to infer underlying events based on social sensing. The overview, insights, models and algorithms presented in this paper stem from recent developments in computer-science, economics, psychology and electrical engineering. © 2016 American Institute of Mathematical Sciences.

abstract={The Arctic is commonly perceived as a pristine wilderness, yet more than four centuries of human industry have not left Svalbard untouched. This paper explores the historical dimension of human-induced ecosystem change using human presence as a proxy. Its aims are fourfold: to reconstruct and quantify historical human presence, to ascertain if human presence is a suitable indicator of long-term anthropogenic pressure, to deduce trends in anthropogenic pressure on five selected species of game animal, and to postulate trends in their subpopulation sizes. Published sources give rise to 57 datasets dealing with the annual voyages to Svalbard as well as the participants in them. All known archaeological sites are visualised in a distribution map. Despite the large amount of data, the quantification of historical human presence remains biased and partial. Only with the aid of a timeline of known milestones is it possible to make hypotheses about changes in anthropogenic pressure and animal subpopulations over time. The exercise is nonetheless a necessary and instructive one: it confirms that the erroneous view of Svalbard as a pristine ecosystem hinders timely historical-ecological research. Future work must aim at the systematic quantification of past human impact in a holistic approach to environmental conservation and restoration. © 2016 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract={Game theoretic approaches have recently been used to model the deterrence effect of patrol officers’ assignments on opportunistic crimes in urban areas. One major challenge in this domain is modeling the behavior of opportunistic criminals. Compared to strategic attackers (such as terrorists) who execute a well-laid out plan, opportunistic criminals are less strategic in planning attacks and more flexible in executing well-laid plans based on their knowledge of patrol officers’ assignments. In this paper, we aim to design an optimal police patrolling strategy against opportunistic criminals in urban areas. Our approach is comprised by two major parts: learning a model of the opportunistic criminal (and how he or she responds to patrols) and then planning optimal patrols against this learned model. The planning part, by using information about how criminals responds to patrols, takes into account the strategic game interaction between the police and criminals. In more detail, first, we propose two categories of models for modeling opportunistic crimes. The first category of models learns the relationship between defender strategy and crime distribution as a Markov chain. The second category of models represents the interaction of criminals and patrol officers as a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) with the number of criminals as the unobserved hidden states. To this end, we: (i) apply standard algorithms, such as Expectation Maximization (EM), to learn the parameters of the DBN; (ii) modify the DBN representation that allows for a compact representation of the model, resulting in better learning accuracy and the increased speed of learning of the EM algorithm when used for the modified DBN. These modifications exploit the structure of the problem and use independence assumptions to factorize the large joint probability distributions. Next, we propose an iterative learning and planning mechanism that periodically updates the adversary model. We demonstrate the efficiency of our learning algorithms by applying them to a real dataset of criminal activity obtained from the police department of the University of Southern California (USC) situated in Los Angeles, CA, USA. We project a significant reduction in crime rate using our planning strategy as compared to the actual strategy deployed by the police department. We also demonstrate the improvement in crime prevention in simulation when we use our iterative planning and learning mechanism when compared to just learning once and planning. Finally, we introduce a web-based software for recommending patrol strategies, which is currently deployed at USC. In the near future, our learning and planning algorithm is planned to be integrated with this software.

abstract={This paper considers a statistical signal processing problem involving agent-based models of financial markets, which at a microlevel are driven by socially aware and risk-averse agents. These agents trade (buy or sell) stocks at each trading instant by using the decisions of all previous agents (social learning) in addition to a private (noisy) signal they receive on the value of the stock. We are interested in the following: 1) modelling the dynamics of these risk averse agents and 2) sequential detection of a market shock based on the behaviour of these agents. Structural results that characterize social learning under a risk measure, conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), are presented and formulation of the Bayesian change point detection problem is provided. The structural results exhibit two interesting properties: 1) risk averse agents herd more often than risk neutral agents and 2) the stopping set in the sequential detection problem is nonconvex. The framework is validated on data from the Yahoo! Tech Buzz game dataset and it is revealed that 1) the model identifies the value changes based on agent's trading decisions. 2) Reasonable quickest detection performance is achieved when the agents are risk-averse. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Security has been identified to be the principal stumbling-block preventing users and enterprises from moving their businesses to the cloud. The reason is that cloud systems, besides inheriting all the vulnerabilities of the traditional computing systems, appeal to new types of threats engendered mainly by the virtualization concept that allows multiple users' virtual machines (VMs) to share a common computing platform. This broadens the attack space of the malicious users and increases their ability to attack both the cloud system and other co-resident VMs. Motivated by the absence of any approach that addresses the problem of optimal detection load distribution in the domain of cloud computing, we develop a resource-aware maxmin game theoretical model that guides the hypervisor on how the detection load should be optimally distributed among its guest VMs in the real-time. The objective is to maximize the hypervisor's probability of detection, knowing that the attacker is dividing the attack over several VMs to minimize this probability. Experimental results on Amazon EC2 pricing dataset reveal that our model increases the probability of detecting distributed attacks, reduces the false positives, and minimizes the resources wasted during the detection process. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective: The causal link between a household’s economic standing and child health is known to suffer from endogeneity. While past studies have exemplified the causal link to be small, albeit statistically significant, this paper aims to estimate the causal effect to investigate whether the effect of income after controlling for the endogeneity remains small in the long run. By correcting for the bias, and knowing the bias direction, one can also infer about the underlying backward effect. Design and setting: This paper uses an instrument variables two-stage-least-squares estimation on the Young Lives 2009 cross-sectional dataset from Andhra Pradesh, India, to understand the aforementioned relationship. Results: The selected measure of household economic standing differentially affects the estimation. There is significant positive effect of both short-run household expenditure and long-run household wealth on child stunting, with the latter having a larger impact. The backward link running from child health to household income is likely an inverse association in our sample with lower child health inducing higher earnings. While higher average community education improved child health, increased community entertainment expenditure is found to have a negative effect. Conclusion: While policies catered towards improving household wealth will decrease child stunting in the long run, maternal education and the community play an equally reinforcing role in improving child health and are perhaps faster routes to achieving the goal of better child health in the short run. © 2016, The Author(s).},

abstract={The Internet has become an integral part of our everyday life. Unfortunately, not all of us are equally aware of the threats when we use online services. Naive users are generally less aware of security and privacy practices on the Internet and are susceptible to online predators. In this paper, we present a behavioral analysis of Internet users and their susceptibility to online malpractices. We have considered the dataset from the Global Internet User Survey for 10789 respondents to perform a security-oriented statistical analysis of correlated user behavior. We constructed logistic regression models to analyze the statistical predictability of susceptible and not-so-susceptible identity theft victims based on their behavior and knowledge of security and privacy practices. We posit that such a study can be used to assess the vulnerability of Internet users and can hence be used to leverage institutional and personal safety on the Internet by promoting online security education, threat awareness, and guided Internet-safe behavior. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Studies exploring the potential of Chaos Game Representations (CGR) of genomic sequences to act as "genomic signatures" (to be species- and genome-specific) showed that CGR patterns of nuclear and organellar DNA sequences of the same organism can be very different. While the hypothesis that CGRs of mitochondrial DNA sequences can act as genomic signatures was validated for a snapshot of all sequenced mitochondrial genomes available in the NCBI GenBank sequence database, to our knowledge no such extensive analysis of CGRs of nuclear DNA sequences exists to date. Results: We analyzed an extensive dataset, totalling 1.45 gigabase pairs, of nuclear/nucleoid genomic sequences (nDNA) from 42 different organisms, spanning all major kingdoms of life. Our computational experiments indicate that CGR signatures of nDNA of two different origins cannot always be differentiated, especially if they originate from closely-related species such as H. sapiens and P. troglodytes or E. coli and E. fergusonii. To address this issue, we propose the general concept of additive DNA signature of a set (collection) of DNA sequences. One particular instance, the composite DNA signature, combines information from nDNA fragments and organellar (mitochondrial, chloroplast, or plasmid) genomes. We demonstrate that, in this dataset, composite DNA signatures originating from two different organisms can be differentiated in all cases, including those where the use of CGR signatures of nDNA failed or was inconclusive. Another instance, the assembled DNA signature, combines information from many short DNA subfragments (e.g., 100 basepairs) of a given DNA fragment, to produce its signature. We show that an assembled DNA signature has the same distinguishing power as a conventionally computed CGR signature, while using shorter contiguous sequences and potentially less sequence information. Conclusions: Our results suggest that, while CGR signatures of nDNA cannot always play the role of genomic signatures, composite and assembled DNA signatures (separately or in combination) could potentially be used instead. Such additive signatures could be used, e.g., with raw unassembled next-generation sequencing (NGS) read data, when high-quality sequencing data is not available, or to complement information obtained by other methods of species identification or classification. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Motion classification using accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer sensors have been an important area of exploration for the past decade. Mostly studied in the context of health related applications, the implications of accurate inertial-magnetic motion classification span from continuous daily activity monitoring and remote assessment of patients recovery to athlete optimization and entertainment applications. While much has been done to optimize classification and segmentation algorithms, very little is understood of the effect sensor selection and motion representation has on overall system performance. In this paper, three sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation), seven motion representations and six classification techniques (K Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes) are compared. In addition to traditional time domain motion representations, a novel space domain representation is put forth which results in a two order of magnitude reduction in computational complexity. A case study dataset is created from 11 individuals performing 10 repetitions of 10 different upper body exercises. A single bicep mounted smart phone is used for data collection and both action classification and non-action rejection ability are studied. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Social media platforms contain interesting information that can be used to directly measure people' feelings and, thanks to the use of communication technologies, also to geographically locate these feelings. Unfortunately, the understanding is not as easy as one may think. Indeed, the large volume of data makes the manual approach impractical and the diversity of language combined with the brevity of the texts makes the automatic approach quite complicated. In this paper, we consider the gamification approach to sentimentally classify tweets and we propose TSentiment, a game with a purpose that uses human beings to classify the polarity of tweets (e.g., positive, negative, neutral) and their sentiment (e.g., joy, surprise, sadness, etc.). We created a dataset of more than 65,000 tweets, we developed a Web-based game and we asked students to play the game. Obtained results showed that the game approach was well accepted and thus it can be useful in scenarios where the identification of people' feelings may bring benefits to decision making processes. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a general probabilistic framework for predicting the outcome of pairwise matchups (e.g. two-player sport matches) and pairwise preferences (e.g. product preferences), both of which have widespread applications ranging from matchmaking in computer games to recommendation in e-commerce. Unlike existing models for these tasks, our model not only learns representations of the items in a more expressive latent vector space, but also models how context modifies matchup and preference outcomes. For example, the context "weather" may alter the winning probability in a tennis match, or the fact that the user is on a mobile device may alter his preferences among restaurants. More generally, the model is capable of handling any symmetric game/comparison problem that can be described by vectorized player/item and game/context features. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of its predictive performance with real datasets from both domains to show its ability to predict preference and game outcomes more accurately than existing models. Furthermore, we demonstrate on synthetic datasets the expressiveness of the model when compared against theoretical limits. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={An increasing number of domains are providing us with detailed trace data on human decisions in settings where we can evaluate the quality of these decisions via an algorithm. Motivated by this development, an emerging line of work has begun to consider whether we can characterize and predict the kinds of decisions where people are likely to make errors. To investigate what a general framework for human error prediction might look like, we focus on a model system with a rich history in the behavioral sciences: the decisions made by chess players as they select moves in a game. We carry out our analysis at a large scale, employing datasets with several million recorded games, and using chess tablebases to acquire a form of ground truth for a subset of chess positions that have been completely solved by computers but remain challenging even for the best players in the world. We organize our analysis around three categories of features that we argue are present in most settings where the analysis of human error is applicable: the skill of the decision-maker, the time available to make the decision, and the inherent difficulty of the decision. We identify rich structure in all three of these categories of features, and find strong evidence that in our domain, features describing the inherent difficulty of an instance are significantly more powerful than features based on skill or time. © 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

abstract={An adversary who has obtained the cryptographic hash of a user's password can mount an offline attack to crack the password by comparing this hash value with the cryptographic hashes of likely password guesses. This offline attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest to crack the password. Key-stretching techniques like hash iteration and memory hard functions have been proposed to mitigate the threat of offline attacks by making each password guess more expensive for the adversary to verify. However, these techniques also increase costs for a legitimate authentication server. We introduce a novel Stackelberg game model which captures the essential elements of this interaction between a defender and an offline attacker. In the game the defender first commits to a key-stretching mechanism, and the offline attacker responds in a manner that optimizes his utility (expected reward minus expected guessing costs). We then introduce Cost Asymmetric Secure Hash (CASH), a randomized key-stretching mechanism that minimizes the fraction of passwords that would be cracked by a rational offline attacker without increasing amortized authentication costs for the legitimate authentication server. CASH is motivated by the observation that the legitimate authentication server will typically run the authentication procedure to verify a correct password, while an offline adversary will typically use incorrect password guesses. By using randomization we can ensure that the amortized cost of running CASH to verify a correct password guess is significantly smaller than the cost of rejecting an incorrect password. Using our Stackelberg game framework we can quantify the quality of the underlying CASH running time distribution in terms of the fraction of passwords that a rational offline adversary would crack. We provide an efficient algorithm to compute high quality CASH distributions for the defender. Finally, we analyze CASH using empirical data from two large scale password frequency datasets. Our analysis shows that CASH can significantly reduce (up to 50%) the fraction of password cracked by a rational offline adversary. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: The AMNOG regulation, introduced in 2011 in Germany, changed the game for new drugs. Now, the industry is required to submit a dossier to the GBA (the central decision body in the German sickness fund system) to show additional benefit. After granting the magnitude of the additional benefit by the GBA, the manufacturer is entitled to negotiate the reimbursement price with the GKV-SV (National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds). The reimbursement price is defined as a discount on the drug price at launch. As the price or discount negotiations between the manufacturers and the GKV-SV takes place behind closed doors, the factors influencing the results of the negotiation are not known. Objectives: The aim of this evaluation is to identify factors influencing the results of the AMNOG price negotiation process. Methods: The analysis was based on a dataset containing detailed information on all assessments until the end of 2015. A descriptive analysis was followed by an econometric analysis of various potential factors (benefit rating, size of target population, deviating from appropriate comparative therapy and incorporation of HRQoL-data). Results: Until December 2015, manufacturers and the GKV-SV finalized 96 negotiations in 193 therapeutic areas, based on assessment conducted by the GBA. The GBA has granted an additional benefit to 100/193 drug innovations. Negotiated discount was significantly higher for those drugs without additional benefit (p = 0.030) and non-orphan drugs (p = 0.015). Smaller population size, no deviation from recommended appropriate comparative therapy and the incorporation of HRQoL-data were associated with a lower discount on the price at launch. However, neither a uni- nor the multivariate linear regression showed enough power to predict the final discount. Conclusions: Although the AMNOG regulation implemented binding and strict rules for the benefit assessment itself, the outcome of the discount negotiations are still unpredictable. Obviously, negotiation tactics, the current political situation and soft factors seem to play a more influential role for the outcome of the negotiations than the five hard and known factors analyzed in this study. Further research is needed to evaluate additional factors. © 2016, Theidel et al.},

abstract={Online gaming franchises such as World of Tanks, Defense of the Ancients, and StarCraft have attracted hundreds of millions of users who, apart from playing the game, also socialize with each other through gaming and viewing gamecasts. As a form of User Generated Content (UGC), gamecasts play an important role in user entertainment and gamer education. They deserve the attention of both industrial partners and the academic communities, corresponding to the large amount of revenue involved and the interesting research problems associated with UGC sites and social networks. Although previous work has put much effort into analyzing general UGC sites such as YouTube, relatively little is known about the gamecast sharing sites. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive study of gamecast sharing sites, including commercial streaming-based sites such as Amazon's Twitch.tv and community-maintained replay-based sites such as WoTreplays. We collect and share a novel dataset on WoTreplays that includes more than 380,000 game replays, shared by more than 60,000 creators with more than 1.9 million gamers. Together with an earlier published dataset on Twitch.tv, we investigate basic characteristics of gamecast sharing sites, and we analyze the activities of their creators and spectators. Among our results, we find that (i) WoTreplays and Twitch.tv are both fast-consumed repositories, with millions of gamecasts being uploaded, viewed, and soon forgotten; (ii) both the gamecasts and the creators exhibit highly skewed popularity, with a significant heavy tail phenomenon; and (iii) the upload and download preferences of creators and spectators are different: while the creators emphasize their individual skills, the spectators appreciate team-wise tactics. Our findings provide important knowledge for infrastructure and service improvement, for example, in the design of proper resource allocation mechanisms that consider future gamecasting and in the tuning of incentive policies that further help player retention. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={With the rapid development of mobile devices and crowdsourcing platforms, the spatial crowdsourcing has attracted much attention from the database community. Specifically, the spatial crowdsourcing refers to sending location-based requests to workers, based on their current positions. In this paper, we consider a spatial crowdsourcing scenario, in which each worker has a set of qualified skills, whereas each spatial task (e.g., repairing a house, decorating a room, and performing entertainment shows for a ceremony) is time-constrained, under the budget constraint, and required a set of skills. Under this scenario, we will study an important problem, namely multi-skill spatial crowdsourcing (MS-SC), which finds an optimal worker-and-task assignment strategy, such that skills between workers and tasks match with each other, and workers' benefits are maximized under the budget constraint. We prove that the MS-SC problem is NP-hard and intractable. Therefore, we propose three effective heuristic approaches, including greedy, g-divide-and-conquer and cost-model-based adaptive algorithms to get worker-and-task assignments. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our MS-SC processing approaches on both real and synthetic data sets. © 1989-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Research summary: Although opinion conformity is believed to be commonly used by corporate elites to invoke reciprocity, it is hard to study in the context of corporate boards since boards are typically “black boxes.” Focusing on publicly traded companies in China, where disclosure of dissent is mandated, we show that dissent is associated with a breakdown of the social exchange relationship within boards. Specifically, dissent is more likely to occur when the board chair who appointed the independent director has left the board, or when the board “game” is reaching its last round, defined as a 60-day window before departure of the board chair or the director herself. Our findings lend considerable support to conceptualization of boards as a social exchange device. Managerial summary: With a novel dataset from China we ask the question of whether the social norm of reciprocity compromises independent directors' decisions. Our results lend considerable support to the hypothesis that independent directors would generally defer to top management as they feel indebted for being offered a director position and in exchange independent directors provide support. We identified two instances in which independent directors are more likely to dissent due to a breakdown of social exchange relationships: (1) when the board chair who appointed the independent director has left the board, and (2) when the board “game” was reaching its last round, that is, either the board chair or the director herself is leaving the board. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={The introduction of fractional flow reserve computed tomography (FFR-CT) that is performed from static coronary CT angiography datasets may open new horizons in the diagnostic management of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. FFR-CT has a high sensitivity and moderate specificity in identifying ischemia in intermediate coronary stenoses. It has been demonstrated that this technology has the potential to significantly reduce the number of invasive coronary angiograms and the rate of normal coronary angiograms that are not followed by an intervention. Furthermore, initial data indicate that FFR-CT may predict the hemodynamic effect of stenting and even of bypass surgery. Thus, FFR-CT, with its capacity to serve as an effective gatekeeper before invasive angiography and the option to virtually predict the success of revascularization, constitutes a completely new concept in managing patients with stable angina pectoris. Before this exciting technology can enter clinical practice, however, some evident limitations need to be overcome and significantly more data concerning accuracy and influence on clinical and economic outcome parameters need to be generated. © 2016, Springer Medizin Verlag.},

abstract={Protein structural class prediction plays an important role in protein structure and function analysis, drug design and many other biological applications. Extracting good representation from protein sequence is fundamental for this prediction task. In recent years, although several secondary structure based feature extraction strategies have been specially proposed for low-similarity protein sequences, the prediction accuracy still remains limited. To explore the potential of secondary structure information, this study proposed a novel feature extraction method from the chaos game representation of predicted secondary structure to mainly capture sequence order information and secondary structure segments distribution information in a given protein sequence. Several kinds of prediction accuracies obtained by the jackknife test are reported on three widely used low-similarity benchmark datasets (25PDB, 1189 and 640). Compared with the state-of-the-art prediction methods, the proposed method achieves the highest overall accuracies on all the three datasets. The experimental results confirm that the proposed feature extraction method is effective for accurate prediction of protein structural class. Moreover, it is anticipated that the proposed method could be extended to other graphical representations of protein sequence and be helpful in future research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We report new experimental data on a simple common value auction to investigate the extent to which bidding can be explained by logit QRE, in combination with different models about bidder beliefs: cursed equilibrium, level-k, and cognitive hierarchy. There is a close correspondence between the predicted bidding patterns in those models and the distribution of observed bids. The pattern of median bids in the data consists of a combination of overbidding with low signals, and near-value-bidding with higher signals. Logit QRE with heterogeneous bidders approximates this pattern. Combining QRE with any of the other models of belief formation leads to a closer match with the data. All the estimated models predict only small treatment effects across different versions of the game, consistent with the data. We also reanalyze an earlier dataset for the same game (Ivanov et al., 2010), which exhibited much more overbidding, and reach similar qualitative conclusions. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Objective: To develop and evaluate energy expenditure (EE) estimation models for a physical activity monitoring system (PAMS) in manual wheelchair users with spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based laboratory environment, a semistructured environment at the National Veterans Wheelchair Games, and the participants' home environments. Participants: Volunteer sample of manual wheelchair users with SCI (N=45). Intervention Participants were asked to perform 10 physical activities (PAs) of various intensities from a list. The PAMS consists of a gyroscope-based wheel rotation monitor (G-WRM) and an accelerometer device worn on the upper arm or on the wrist. Criterion EE using a portable metabolic cart and raw sensor data from PAMS were collected during each of these activities. Main Outcome Measures: Estimated EE using custom models for manual wheelchair users based on either the G-WRM and arm accelerometer (PAMS-Arm) or the G-WRM and wrist accelerometer (PAMS-Wrist). Results: EE estimation performance for the PAMS-Arm (average error ± SD: -9.82%±37.03%) and PAMS-Wrist (-5.65%±32.61%) on the validation dataset indicated that both PAMS-Arm and PAMS-Wrist were able to estimate EE for a range of PAs with &lt;10% error. Moderate to high intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) indicated that the EE estimated by PAMS-Arm (ICC3,1=.82, P&lt;.05) and PAMS-Wrist (ICC3,1=.89, P&lt;.05) are consistent with the criterion EE. Conclusions: Availability of PA monitors can assist wheelchair users to track PA levels, leading toward a healthier lifestyle. The new models we developed can estimate PA levels in manual wheelchair users with SCI in laboratory and community settings. © 2016 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

abstract={Progress and technological innovation achieved in recent years, particularly in the area of entertainment and games, have promoted the creation of more natural and intuitive human-computer interfaces. For example, natural interaction devices such as Microsoft Kinect allow users to explore a more expressive way of human-computer communication by recognizing body gestures. In this context, several Supervised Machine Learning techniques have been proposed to recognize gestures. However, scarce research works have focused on a comparative study of the behavior of these techniques. Therefore, this chapter presents an evaluation of 4 Machine Learning techniques by using the Microsoft Research Cambridge (MSRC- 12) Kinect gesture dataset, which involves 30 people performing 12 different gestures. Accuracy was evaluated with different techniques obtaining correct-recognition rates close to 100% in some results. Briefly, the experiments performed in this chapter are likely to provide new insights into the application of Machine Learning technique to facilitate the task of gesture recognition. © 2016 by IGI Global.

abstract={Background: Various strategies have been used for inferring brain functions from stroke lesions. We explored a new mathematical approach based on game theory, the so-called multi-perturbation Shapley value analysis (MSA), to assess causal function localizations and interactions from multiple perturbation data. We applied MSA to a dataset composed of lesion patterns of 148 acute stroke patients and their National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, to systematically investigate the influence of different parameter settings on the outcomes of the approach. Specifically, we investigated aspects of MSA methodology including the choice of the predictor algorithm (typology and kernel functions), training dataset (original versus binary), as well as the influence of lesion thresholds. We assessed the suitability of MSA for processing real clinical lesion data and established the central parameters for this analysis. Results: We derived general recommendations for the analysis of clinical datasets by MSA and showed that, for the studied dataset, the best approach was to use a linear-kernel support vector machine predictor, trained with a binary training dataset, where the binarization was implemented through a median threshold of lesion size for each region. We demonstrated that the results obtained with different MSA variants lead to almost identical results as the basic MSA. Conclusions: MSA is a feasible approach for the multivariate lesion analysis of clinical stroke data. Informed choices need to be made to set parameters that may affect the analysis outcome. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={In the web, page creators often compete for their ranking on relevant search queries, as high ranking attracts users and may lead to increased revenues. The positive effect of this competition is that it encourages page owners to improve their content. However, some techniques used for this improvement, such as keyword stuffing, are considered harmful. Current search engine literature largely ignores the interplay between the retrieval system and the pages' content evolvement. This paper studies the above phenomenon. We model pages as strategic players, competing for a better rank by content manipulations, while the search engine controls the ranking mechanism. We show that such competition may degrade retrieval effectiveness as irrelevant pages tend to outrank better ones. Further, we investigate how the search engine's choice of a ranking scheme may reduce the incentive to manipulate the page content. Finally, we propose a novel ranking solution that empirically minimizes the adverse effect on a real dataset. © 2016 ACM.},

Our experiments focus on character recognition which later can be used for various applications such as tutoring, mathematical kids games, and automatic telephone number conversion from sign boards in India and Pakistan. In our research, we investigate the correlation between the numeral shapes and apply famous state-of-The art classifier based on correlation based template matching. We experimentally show that template matching gives poor performance as the shapes of numerals are highly correlated. There exists little volume of literature to address OCR on Sindhi language but unavailability of benchmark dataset makes it difficult for researchers around the world to re-implement the literature frameworks.

abstract={Affective-interaction in computer games is a novel area with several new challenges, such as detecting players facial expressions robustly. Many of the existing facial expression datasets are composed of a set of posed face images not captured in a realistic affective-interaction setting. The contribution of this paper is an affective-interaction dataset captured while users were playing a game that reacted to their facial-expressions. This dataset was the result of a framework designed for gathering affective-interaction data and annotating this data with high-quality labels. The first part of the framework is a computer game [15] planned to elicit a particular facial expressions that directly control the game outcome. Thus, the game creates a true and engaging affective-interaction scenario where facial-expressions data were captured. The proposed dataset is composed of a series of sequential video frames where faces were detected while users interacted with a game with their facial expressions. The second part of the framework is a crowdsourcing process designed to ask annotators to identify the facial-expression present in a given face image. Each face image was annotated with a facial-expression: happy, anger, disgust, contempt, sad, fear, surprise, and neutral. We examined how the annotators performance was affected by multiple variables, e.g., reward, judgment limits, golden questions. Once these parameters were tuned, we gathered 229,584 annotations for the whole 42,911 images. Statistical consensus techniques were then used to merge the annotators judgments and produce high-quality image-labels. Finally, we compared different classifiers trained on both ground-truth (expert) labels and crowdsourcing labels: we observed no differences in classification accuracy, which confirms the quality of the produced labels. Thus, we conclude that the proposed affective-interaction dataset provides a unique set of images of people playing games with their facial expressions and labels with a quality similar to that of expert labels (differences are less than 9%). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Social networks are fundamental mediums for diffusion of information and contagions appear at some node of the network and get propagated over the edges. Prior researches mainly focus on each contagion spreading independently, regardless of multiple contagions’ interactions as they propagate at the same time. In the real world, simultaneous news and events usually have to compete for user’s attention to get propagated. In some other cases, they can cooperate with each other and achieve more influences. In this paper, an evolutionary game theoretic framework is proposed to model the interactions among multiple contagions. The basic idea is that different contagions in social networks are similar to the multiple organisms in a population, and the diffusion process is as organisms interact and then evolve from one state to another. This framework statistically learns the payoffs as contagions interacting with each other and builds the payoff matrix. Since learning payoffs for all pairs of contagions IS almost impossible (quadratic in the number of contagions), a contagion clustering method is proposed in order to decrease the number of parameters to fit, which makes our approach efficient and scalable. To verify the proposed framework, we conduct experiments by using real-world information spreading dataset of Digg. Experimental results show that the proposed game theoretic framework helps to comprehend the information diffusion process better and can predict users’ forwarding behaviors with more accuracy than the previous studies. The analyses of evolution dynamics of contagions and evolutionarily stable strategy reveal whether a contagion can be promoted or suppressed by others in the diffusion process.

The feature selection algorithms associated with nonlinear kernel-based support vector machines (SVM) are either NP-hard or greedy and hence, not very optimal. To deal with this problem, a metric based on the principles of CGT called Shapely value (SV) and a sampling approximation is used to determine the contributions of individual features toward the classification task. Feature subsets are randomly drawn from a probability distribution function (pdf) generated using normalized SVs of the individual features. These feature subsets are then used to build kernels corresponding to individual weak classifiers in the sparse kernel-based ensemble learning (SKEL) framework. By weighting the kernels optimally and sparsely, a small number of useful subsets of features are selected which improve the generalization performance of the ensemble classifier. The algorithm is applied on real hyperspectral datasets, and the results are presented in the paper. Â© 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={For both domestic and non-domestic consumers, dynamic electricity tariffs have been proposed as a way to reduce their energy costs and to facilitate demand-side response. It is difficult for businesses which are tenants to adopt energy efficiency measures; thus, tariff switching is the easier option. Therefore, understanding the limits of the cost saving offered by tariff switching is an important step. This raises two questions: by how much could bills be reduced, and would all consumers benefit equally? Using a dataset of half-hourly electricity readings from more than 7500 British businesses, we performed an empirical analysis to discover which types of businesses might have lower or higher costs when changing between static and real-time tariffs. We identified differences in demand profiles that demonstrate that the decision whether to switch tariff types is a subtle one which may have a significant cost impact. The dataset was aggregated into five categories: Entertainment, Industry, Retail, Social, and Other. Our analytical methods can be used to distinguish the differences between typical electricity demand profiles for small- to medium-sized businesses and sectors in different market options. Our analyses of switching to a real-time tariff suggest that most of those small- to medium-sized businesses that would reduce their annual electricity bill would gain by no more than 10 %. Most of these businesses would gain by less than 5 %. This, we suggest, sets a realistic upper limit of the likely cash savings before energy efficiency, or other measures must be taken to further reduce bills. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Professional association football is a game of talent. The success of a professional club hinges largely on its ability of assembling the best team. Building on a dataset of player transfer records among more than 400 clubs in 24 world-wide top class leagues from 2011 to 2015, this study aims to relate a club's success to its activities in the player transfer market from a network perspective. We confirm that modern professional football is indeed a money game, in which larger investment spent on the acquisition of talented players generally yields better team performance. However, further investigation shows that professional football clubs can actually play different strategies in surviving or even excelling this game, and the success of strategies is strongly associated to their network properties in the football player transfer network. © 2016 Liu et al.

The present study investigates this established relationship between aggressive behavior and ambient temperature in the highly aggressive context of professional football in the National Football League (NFL). Methods: Using a publicly available dataset, authors conducted multiple hierarchical regression analyses on game-level data (2326 games). Results: The analysis revealed that temperature positively predicted aggressive penalties in football, and that this relationship was significant for teams playing at home but not for visiting teams. Conclusion: These results indicate that even in the aggressive context of football, warmer weather contributes to increased violence. Further, the presence of the heat-aggression relationship for the home team suggests that the characteristics of interacting groups may influence whether heat would have an adverse effect on the outcome of those interactions. © 2016 .},

abstract={Objective: The Nintendo Wii Fit integrates virtual gaming with body movement, and may be suitable as an adjunct to conventional physiotherapy following lower limb fractures. This study examined the feasibility and safety of using the Wii Fit as an adjunct to outpatient physiotherapy following lower limb fractures, and reports sample size considerations for an appropriately powered randomised trial. Methodology: Ambulatory patients receiving physiotherapy following a lower limb fracture participated in this study (n = 18). All participants received usual care (individual physiotherapy). The first nine participants also used the Wii Fit under the supervision of their treating clinician as an adjunct to usual care. Adverse events, fracture malunion or exacerbation of symptoms were recorded. Pain, balance and patient-reported function were assessed at baseline and discharge from physiotherapy. Results: No adverse events were attributed to either the usual care physiotherapy or Wii Fit intervention for any patient. Overall, 15 (83%) participants completed both assessments and interventions as scheduled. For 80% power in a clinical trial, the number of complete datasets required in each group to detect a small, medium or large effect of the Wii Fit at a post-intervention assessment was calculated at 175, 63 and 25, respectively. Conclusions: The Nintendo Wii Fit was safe and feasible as an adjunct to ambulatory physiotherapy in this sample. When considering a likely small effect size and the 17% dropout rate observed in this study, 211 participants would be required in each clinical trial group. A larger effect size or multiple repeated measures design would require fewer participants. © 2015 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy.},

abstract={European mouflons (Ovis orientalis musimon) are Mediterranean sheep that were introduced worldwide as park and game animals during the last few centuries. Today, European mouflons are endangered in their natural refuge areas. Mouflons are able to interbreed with domestic breeds to form fertile hybrids of an intermediate phenotype. As some introduced mouflon populations were deliberately crossed with primitive domestic breeds to improve their hardiness and trophy size and as evidence of uncontrolled interbreeding exists, the alleged purity of most mouflon populations has been debated for decades. In this study, we developed a genetic test to separate pure bred mouflons and domestic sheep from their hybrids. We searched for hybridization using insertionally polymorphic endogenous retroviruses and a set of novel microsatellites. Three instances were found of domestic sheep alleles in a retrotype dataset out of 192 mouflons from Western Germany. Considering the combined outcome of microsatellite and retrotype profiling, the amount of hybridization is negligible. We assume that the selective hunting of animals that show signs of hybridization in their phenotype is responsible for the low number of hybrids. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Image annotation has attracted a lot of research interest, and multi-label learning is an effective technique for image annotation. How to effectively exploit the underlying correlation among labels is a crucial task for multi-label learning. Most existing multi-label learning methods exploit the label correlation only in the output label space, leaving the connection between the label and the features of images untouched. Although, recently some methods attempt toward exploiting the label correlation in the input feature space by using the label information, they cannot effectively conduct the learning process in both the spaces simultaneously, and there still exists much room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label learning approach, named multi-label dictionary learning (MLDL) with label consistency regularization and partial-identical label embedding MLDL, which conducts MLDL and partial-identical label embedding simultaneously. In the input feature space, we incorporate the dictionary learning technique into multi-label learning and design the label consistency regularization term to learn the better representation of features. In the output label space, we design the partial-identical label embedding, in which the samples with exactly same label set can cluster together, and the samples with partial-identical label sets can collaboratively represent each other. Experimental results on the three widely used image datasets, including Corel 5K, IAPR TC12, and ESP Game, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Motion sensing plays an important role in the study of human movements, motivated by a wide range of applications in different fields, such as sports, health care, daily activity, action recognition for surveillance, assisted living and the entertainment industry. In this paper, we describe how to classify a set of human movements comprising daily activities using a wearable motion capture suit, denoted as FatoXtract. A probabilistic integration of different classifiers recently proposed is employed herein, considering several spatiotemporal features, in order to classify daily activities. The classification model relies on the computed confidence belief from base classifiers, combining multiple likelihoods from three different classifiers, namely Naïve Bayes, artificial neural networks and support vector machines, into a single form, by assigning weights from an uncertainty measure to counterbalance the posterior probability. In order to attain an improved performance on the overall classification accuracy, multiple features in time domain (e.g., velocity) and frequency domain (e.g., fast Fourier transform), combined with geometrical features (joint rotations), were considered. A dataset from five daily activities performed by six participants was acquired using FatoXtract. The dataset provided in this work was designed to be extremely challenging since there are high intra-class variations, the duration of the action clips varies dramatically, and some of the actions are quite similar (e.g., brushing teeth and waving, or walking and step). Reported results, in terms of both precision and recall, remained around 85 %, showing that the proposed framework is able to successfully classify different human activities. © 2016 Springer-Verlag London},

abstract={Predicting the trajectory of a wide receiver in the game of American football requires prior knowledge about the game (e.g., route trees, defensive formations) and an accurate model of how the environment will change over time (e.g., opponent reaction strategies, motion attributes of players). Our aim is to build a computational model of the wide receiver, which takes into account prior knowledge about the game and short-term predictive models of how the environment will change over time. While prior knowledge of the game is readily accessible, it is quite challenging to build predictive models of how the environment will change over time. We propose several models for predicting short-term motions of opponent players to generate dynamic input features for our wide receiver forecasting model. In particular, we model the wide receiver with a Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the reward function is a linear combination of static features (prior knowledge about the game) and dynamic features (short-term prediction of opponent players). Since the dynamic features change over time, we make recursive calls to an inference procedure over the MDP while updating the dynamic features. We validate our technique on a video dataset of American football plays. Our results show that more informed models that accurately predict the motions of the defensive players are better at forecasting wide receiver plays. © 2016 IEEE.},

We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process and learn a search policy by reinforcement learning. To demonstrate the efficacy of our generic algorithm, we apply the 20 questions approach in the recent framework of simultaneous object detection and segmentation. Experimental results on the Pascal VOC dataset show that our algorithm reduces about 45.3% of the object proposals and 36% of average evaluation time while achieving better average precision compared to exhaustive search. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid development of electronic, engineering, information and network technologies, large-scale data mining and knowledge discovery have become a new challenge. In this paper, a hierarchical-coevolutionary-MapReduce-based knowledge reduction algorithm (HCMRKR) with robust ensemble Pareto dominance is proposed for big data analysis. Firstly, a novel hierarchical co-evolutionary MapReduce framework with niche neighborhood radius is designed to divide the entire population into N subpopulations. The layered niche neighborhood radius is constructed so that subpopulations can be self-adaptively decomposed into the attribute approximate space with uncovering the underlying interaction structure of decision attributes. The reduction performances of elitist leaders are surely guaranteed to be the same with those using the whole independent dataset. Secondly, a robust ensemble strategy of reduction Pareto equilibrium is adopted to help elitist leaders from the Pareto front region to conduct the ensemble game of reduction subsets in different niche conic subspaces. Thus, most reduction solutions will be enhanced to be more robust within the stable elitists region. Thirdly, various elitist leaders will use the parallel MapReduce mechanism to determine the best strategy to extract their knowledge reduction set, and the adaptive reduction evolution with incremental learning can be implemented well. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed HCMRKR algorithm can effectively and efficiently handle the knowledge reduction problem in the big data sets as well as keeping more robust and stable performances, compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the validation performed on two kinds of neonatal brain MRIs further demonstrates the HCMRKR's promising advantage for the real-world applications. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={New opportunities and challenges arise with the growing availability of online Arabic reviews. Sentiment analysis of these reviews can help the beneficiary by summarizing the opinions of others about entities or events. Also, for opinions to be comprehensive, analysis should be provided for each aspect or feature of the entity. In this paper, we propose a generic approach that extracts the entity aspects and their attitudes for reviews written in modern standard Arabic. The proposed approach does not exploit predefined sets of features, nor domain ontology hierarchy. Instead we add sentiment tags on the patterns and roots of an Arabic lexicon and used these tags to extract the opinion bearing words and their polarities. The proposed system is evaluated on the entity-level using two datasets of 500 movie reviews with accuracy 96% and 1000 restaurant reviews with accuracy 86.7%. Then the system is evaluated on the aspect-level using 500 Arabic reviews in different domains (Novels, Products, Movies, Football game events and Hotels). It extracted aspects, at 80.8% recall and 77.5% precision with respect to the aspects defined by domain experts. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={The problem of finding an optimum within a set of possibilities that represent the varying successfulness of numerous subjects competing with one another is highly relevant in the field of ecosystem interactions. We propose a method for solving this problem by the application of the Nash equilibrium concept, which is frequently used in ecology. The proposed model is based on the transformation of the initial payoff vectors of subjects that interact in different situations into a statistical set of symmetrical game matrices that consist of permutations of payoff values. The equilibrium solution is expressed as values of the probability of Nash equilibrium occurrence with uniform distribution over all possible permutations based on uncertainty of positions of payoff values in the matrix. We assume that this equilibrium solution provides information on the distribution of the degree of stability among individual situations and interacting subjects. In this paper, we validate this assumption and demonstrate its application to a dataset that represents interspecies interactions in plant ecology. We propose that the use of the Nash equilibrium in the analysis of datasets formalized according to the Pareto optimality scheme is applicable in numerous other contexts. © 2016 Vach, Vachová.

abstract={Active monitoring of avian influenza (AI) viruses in wild birds was initiated in Belgium in 2005 in response to the first highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 outbreaks occurring in Europe. In Belgium, active wild bird surveillance that targeted live-ringed and hunter-harvested wild birds was developed and maintained from 2005 onward. After one decade, this programassimilated, analyzed, and reported on over 35,000 swabs. The 2009-2014 datasets were used for the current analysis because detailed information was available for this period. The overall prevalence of avian influenza (AI) in samples from live-ringed birds during this period was 0.48% whereas it was 6.12% in hunter-harvested samples. While the ringing sampling targeted a large number of bird species and was realized over the years, the hunting sampling was mainly concentrated on mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) during the hunting season, from mid-August to late January. Even when using just AI prevalence for live-ringed A. platyrhynchos during the hunting season, the value remained significantly lower (2.10%) compared to that detected for hunter-harvested mallards. One explanation for this significant difference in viroprevalence in hunter-harvested mallards was the game restocking practice, which released captive-bred birds in the wild before the hunting period. Indeed, the released game restocking birds, having an AI-naïve immune status, could act as local amplifiers of AI viruses already circulating in the wild, and this could affect AI epidemiology. Also, the release into the wild of noncontrolled restocking birds might lead to the introduction of new strains in the natural environment, leading to increased AI presence in the environment. Consequently, the release of naïve or infected restocking birds may affect AI dynamics.},

abstract={Objectives To explore children's accounts of their experiences of the UK's largest childhood obesity programme, MEND (Mind, Exercise, Nutrition...Do it!) (See www.mendprogramme.org). Design Semi-structured interviews were conducted with children who had completed the MEND obesity programme. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA). Method Fourteen children spanning diverse areas of London comprised this study (eight male, six female), aged between 11 and 14 years and in secondary school. Participants were interviewed a year after completing one of the London-based MEND obesity programmes. Results This article focuses on the most common and striking theme to emerge from the original dataset (The complete analysis may be found in L. Watson, Unpublished doctoral thesis): Fun. Subthemes were: 'going with the flow'; active participation in activities that led to new experiences ('actually doing it' - seeing the fun side); the importance of others in the experience of fun ('you do games in unity' - 'it's not as fun on your own'). Conclusion Children have fun when engaged in interactive and varied activities with opportunity for individual feedback and improvement. When designing childhood obesity programmes, conditions that optimise children's experience of fun should be emphasised over didactic and risk-heavy information pertaining to childhood obesity. © 2015 The British Psychological Society.},

However there is an opportunity to utilize the sensing capabilities of wristbands to offer activity tracking services within the domain of team-based sports games. In this paper we demonstrate the design of an activity tracking system capable of detecting the players' activities within a one-to-one basketball game. Relying on the inertial sensors of wristbands and smartphones, the system can capture the shooting attempts of each player and provide statistics about their performance. The system is based on a two-level classification architecture, combining data from both players in the game. We employ a technique for semi-automatic labeling of the ground truth that requires minimum manual input during a training game. Using a single game as a training dataset, and applying the classifier on future games we demonstrate that the system can achieve a good level of accuracy detecting the shooting attempts of both players in the game (precision 91.34%, recall 94.31%). © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Although crowd analysis is a classical and extensively studied problem for the computer vision community, the vast majority of the works in the literature assume a single type of crowd, while the sociological literature classifies a number of different typologies, each one with their own distinctive traits. In this paper we focus on a particular kind of crowd referred in sociology as spectator crowd, which consists a number of people that are "interested in watching something specific that they came to see" Berlonghi (1995). This is the typical social formation that attends entertainment events like sport matches, concerts, movies, etc. In this work we present a novel dataset, the Spectators Hockey (S-Hock), containing almost 30 hours of videos recorded at an ice hockey rink during the Winter Universiade "Trentino2013". On these data we provide a massive annotation, focusing on the spectators at different levels of detail: from high level features describing which team a person supports and if he/she knows his/her neighbors; to a lower level, where we consider standard pose information as well as atomic actions like applauding, jumping, etc. We also provide annotations for the game field, which allows us to analyze the relationship between the crowd behavior and the events of the match. Eventually we provide more than 100 million of annotations, that can be used for many different tasks spanning from standard applications, like people counting and head pose estimation, to higher level tasks, like excitement estimation and automatic summarization. We provide protocols and baseline results for all of these applications, encouraging further research in these field. © 2017.},

abstract={DNA-binding proteins (DNA-BPs) play an important role in many biological processes. Now next-generation sequencing technologies are widely used to obtain genome of many organisms. Consequently, identification of DNA-BPs accurately and rapidly will provide significant helps in annotation of genomes. Chaos game representation (CGR) can reveal the information hidden in protein sequences. Furthermore, fractal dimensions are a vital index to measure compactness of complex and irregular geometric objects. In this research, in order to extract the intrinsic correlation with DNAbinding property from protein sequence, CGR algorithm and fractal dimension, together with amino acid composition are applied to formulate the protein samples. Here we employ the random forest as the classifier to predict DNA-BPs based on sequence-derived features with amino acid composition and fractal dimension. This resulting predictor is compared with three important existing methods DNA-Prot, iDNA-Prot and DNAbinder in the same datasets. On two benchmark datasets from DNA-Prot and iDNA-Prot, the average accuracies (ACC) achieve 82.07%, 84.91% respectively, and average Matthew’s correlation coefficients (MCC) achieve 0.6085, 0.6981 respectively. The point to point comparisons demonstrate that our fractal approach shows some improvements. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers},

However, our recognizer is also able to rapidly compare a candidate gesture against numerous templates in a short amount of time, as compared to other recognizers, in order to achieve higher accuracy within a given time budget. Penny Pincher achieves this goal by reducing the template matching process to merely addition and multiplication; by avoiding translation, scaling, and rotation; and by avoiding calls to expensive geometric functions. In an evaluation compared against four other $-family recognizers, in three of our six datasets, Penny Pincher achieves the highest accuracy of all recognizers reaching 97.5%, 99.8%, and 99.9% user independent recognition accuracy, while remaining competitive with the three remaining datasets. Further, when a time constraint is imposed, our recognizer always exhibits the highest accuracy, realizing a reduction in recognition error of between 83% and 99% in most cases as Penny Pincher is able to process five times as many templates in the same amount of time as its closest competitor. Further, in this extended work, we also evaluate the effectiveness of Penny Pincher in a stressful setting using a video game prototype that makes heavy use of gestures, so that rushed and malformed gesture articulation is more likely. Our evaluation was conducted with a 24 participant between-subject user study of Protractor and Penny Pincher. Training data and in-game data collected during the user study was further used to evaluate several $-family recognizers. Again we find that our recognizer is on par with or better than the others, reducing the recognition error by as much as 5.8% to 10.4% with just a small number of templates per gesture. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={A wide spectrum of Internet-scale mobile applications, ranging from social networking, gaming and entertainment to emergency response and crisis management, all require efficient and scalable All k Nearest Neighbor (AkNN) computations over millions of moving objects every few seconds to be operational. Most traditional techniques for computing AkNN queries are centralized, lacking both scalability and efficiency. Only recently, distributed techniques for shared-nothing cloud infrastructures have been proposed to achieve scalability for large datasets. These batch-oriented algorithms are sub-optimal due to inefficient data space partitioning and data replication among processing units. In this paper, we present Spitfire, a distributed algorithm that provides a scalable and high-performance AkNN processing framework. Our proposed algorithm deploys a fast load-balanced partitioning scheme along with an efficient replication-set selection algorithm, to provide fast main-memory computations of the exact AkNN results in a batch-oriented manner. We evaluate, both analytically and experimentally, how the pruning efficiency of the Spitfire algorithm plays a pivotal role in reducing communication and response time up to an order of magnitude, compared to three other state-of-the-art distributed AkNN algorithms executed in distributed main-memory. © 2015 IEEE.},

Numerous Brachylaimoidea, particularly adults of Brachylaima and Leucochloridium, are difficult to identify to species. We provide and analyse sequences of two nuclear (18S rDNA, ITS2) and two mitochondrial (CO1, ND1) DNA loci of central European species of the Brachylaimoidea, namely Leucochloridium holostomum, Leucochloridium paradoxum, Leucochloridium perturbatum, Leucochloridium subtilis, Leucochloridium vogtianum, Urotocus rossitensis, Urogonimus macrostomus, Michajlovia migrata, Leucochloridiomorpha lutea, Brachylaima arcuatus, Brachylaima fuscata and Brachylaima mesostoma. We identified three clades in the genus Leucochloridium, which do not correspond to the previously suggested subgenera Neoleucochloridium, Papilloleucochloridium and Leucochloridium. We reject classification of Urotocus and Urogonimus in Leucochloridiinae, and, instead, re-establish the subfamilies Urotocinae and Urogoniminae. We synonymize the genus Renylaima with the genus Brachylaima. We reject M. migrata as a member of Leucochloridiinae sensu stricto or Brachylaimidae suggested by some previous authors. We found that the previously sequenced Glaphyrostomum sp. does not cluster with any hitherto sequenced Brachylaimidae. We also provide comparative measurements of the examined central European Brachylaimoidea, address the the specificity of their localization in the host and discuss their host-specific prevalence and intensity of infections based on the extensive dataset of birds examined in 1962-2015. © Cambridge University Press 2016.},

abstract={With the prevalence of the commodity depth sensors (e.g. Kinect), multimodal data including RGB stream, depth stream and audio stream have been utilized in various applications such as video games, education and health. Nevertheless, it is still very challenging to effectively fuse the features from multimodal data. In this paper, we propose a WTA (Winner-Take-All) Hash-based feature fusion algorithm and investigate its application in 3D human action recognition. Specifically, the WTA Hashing is performed to encode features from different modalities into the ordinal space. By leveraging the ordinal measures rather than using the absolute value of the original features, such feature embedding can provide a form of resilience to the scale and numerical perturbations. We propose a frame-level feature fusion algorithm and develop a WTA Hash-embedded warping algorithm to measure the similarity between two sequences. Experiments performed on three public 3D human action datasets show that the proposed fusion algorithm has achieved state-of-the-art recognition results even with the nearest neighbor search. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={3d technology brings a new era of entertainment to the human race. It offered a wide array of possibilities in near future in almost every walk of life and in entertainment segment. 3D content generation is the important step in 3D systems. Special cameras such as stereoscopic dual camera, depth range camera etc. are designed to generate the 3D model of a scene directly. There are different techniques to generate the 3D content. But the problem is our current and past media data are in 2D which needs to convert into 3D. This is where the importance of 2D to 3D transformation arises. In this paper proposed real time 3D image and video creation by depth map estimation. Depth map estimation can be done in two methods. One is based on depth fusion method and other is based on saliency map of an image. In dataset image estimate the depth map from depth fusion method and then depth is refined by color spatial variance. In non dataset images we find depth map by global saliency method. Experimental result demonstrates that the proposed technique convey better performance compared to the state-of-the-art of methods. © 2015 IEEE.},

The proposed system employs LLE method to achieve dimensionality reduction on the Hog feature descriptors and thus reduce time complexity. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated using feature and classifier based schemes with different datasets. By using classifier based schemes, fast-additive SVM outperforms other SVM classifiers. The combined feature vector can retain precision of HOG as well as improve the detection rate.

abstract={This paper considers the detection of players in team sport scenes observed with a still or motion-compensated camera. Background-subtracted foreground masks provide easy-to-compute primary cues to identify the vertical silhouettes of moving players in the scene. However, they are shown to be too noisy to achieve reliable detections when only a single viewpoint is available, as often desired for reduced deployment cost. To circumvent this problem, our paper investigates visual classification to identify the true positives among the candidates detected by the foreground mask. It proposes an original approach to automatically adapt the classifier to the game at hand, making the classifier scene-specific for improved accuracy. Since this adaptation implies the use of potentially corrupted labels to train the classifier, a semi-naive Bayesian classifier that combines random sets of binary tests is considered as a robust alternative to boosted classification solutions. In final, our validations on two publicly released datasets prove that our proposed combination of visual and temporal cues supports accurate and reliable players' detection in team sport scenes observed from a single viewpoint. © 2017.},

This study uses an individual level mobile app usage dataset to examine the potential of mobile platform-based social games as training tools for mobile literacy. We choose Anipang, a popular mobile social game app, as a stimulus in an experiment based on a difference-in-differences framework. We classify app users into two groups on the basis of consumption intensity and then analyze the changes in consumption of apps excluding Anipang before and after Anipang adoption. Results reveal that high Anipang consumption increases the duration of app usage and the number of apps used but that such increase is statistically significant only for the latter. These spillover effects are more pronounced among users with limited mobile experiences or are in their 50s or older. These findings suggest that mobile gaming apps are an attractive means of reaching technologically marginalized cohorts. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We attempted to predict activity/dominance for soccer games, where activity is defined as the degree of activity of the game as perceived by the viewer, whereas dominance is the degree at which the viewer perceives a particular team to dominate over the other team. Such activity/dominance information would help a layman viewer understand the game. It would also enable construction of an automatic digest creation system that extracts scenes having high activity/dominance. There are two facets of this study: 1. The main part of the underlying prediction model consists of a Stick-Breaking Hidden Markov Model, where the data automatically estimates the number of states of the Markov process behind the data. 2. The data used in this paper is vector time-series data consisting of player, referee, and ball positions, together with team information, acquired by a set of fixed cameras.

abstract={The identification of genetic markers (e.g. genes, pathways and subnetworks) for cancer has been one of the most challenging research areas in recent years. A subset of these studies attempt to analyze genome-wide expression profiles to identify markers with high reliability and reusability across independent whole-transcriptome microarray datasets. Therefore, the functional relationships of genes are integrated with their expression data. However, for a more accurate representation of the functional relationships among genes, utilization of the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) seems to be necessary. Herein, a novel game theoretic approach (GTA) is proposed for the identification of cancer subnetwork markers by integrating genome-wide expression profiles and PPIN. The GTA method was applied to three distinct whole-transcriptome breast cancer datasets to identify the subnetwork markers associated with metastasis. To evaluate the performance of our approach, the identified subnetwork markers were compared with gene-based, pathway-based and network-based markers. We show that GTA is not only capable of identifying robust metastatic markers, it also provides a higher classification performance. In addition, based on these GTA-based subnetworks, we identified a new bonafide candidate gene for breast cancer susceptibility. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2016.},

abstract={With the advent of cloud computing and the rapid increase in the number of deployed services, the competition between functionally-similar Web services is increasingly governing the markets of services. For example, Amazon and Google are in an intense competition to dominate the market of cloud-based Web services. Such a highly competitive environment motivates and sometimes obliges services to abandon their pure competitive strategies and adopt a cooperative behavior in order to increase their business opportunities and survive in the market. Several approaches have been advanced in the literature to model the cooperation among Web services in a community-based environment. However, the existing approaches suffer from two main drawbacks that limit their effectiveness in the real-world services market. First, they rely on a centralized architecture wherein a master entity is responsible for regulating the community formation process, which creates a single point of failure. Second, they ignore the business potential of the services and treat all of those services in the same way, which demotivates the participation of the well-positioned ones in such communities. To tackle these problems, we distinguish in this paper between two types of services: leaders and followers. Leaders are those services that enjoy high reputation, market share, and capacity of handling requests; whereas followers are those services that cannot compete against the leaders. Thereafter, we model the community formation problem as a virtual trading market between these two types of services and propose a distributed Stackelberg game for this purpose. Promisingly, the proposed model gives guidance to a cooperative model that can be applied in the real markets of Web services in order to achieve higher performance, efficient services compositions, and better resources utilization. The performance of the model is analyzed using a real-life flight booking dataset that includes 2507 services operating on the Web. Simulation results show that the proposed model is able to increase the satisfaction of Web services in terms of gained payoff and reputation and the satisfaction of users in terms of quality of service provided to their requests compared to the existing models, namely the one-stage game theoretical model and a heuristic model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We use the metatheoretical principle of cumulative advantage as a framework to understand the presence of heavy-tailed productivity distributions and productivity stars. We relied on 229 datasets including 633,876 productivity observations collected from approximately 625,000 individuals in occupations including research, entertainment, politics, sports, sales, and manufacturing, among others. We implemented a novel methodological approach developed in the field of physics to assess the precise shape of the productivity distribution rather than relying on a normal versus nonnormal artificial dichotomy. Results indicate that higher levels of multiplicity of productivity, monopolistic productivity, job autonomy, and job complexity (i.e., conductors of cumulative advantage) are associated with a higher probability of an underlying power law distribution, whereas lower productivity ceilings (i.e., insulator of cumulative advantage) are associated with a lower probability. In addition, higher levels of multiplicity of productivity, monopolistic productivity, and job autonomy were associated with a greater proportion of productivity stars (i.e., productivity distributions with heavier tails), whereas lower productivity ceilings were associated with a smaller proportion of productivity stars (i.e., productivity distributions with lighter tails). Results serve as a building block for future theory development and testing efforts aimed at understanding why, when, and how the distribution of individual productivity may follow a nonnormal curve—and to what extent. We also discuss implications for organizations and management in terms of the design and implementation of human resource systems (e.g., selection, training, compensation), as well as for individuals interested in becoming productivity stars themselves. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Video is a rich media widely used in many of our daily life applications like education, entertainment, surveillance, etc. In order to retrieve rapidly, it is necessary to establish digital archive for storing these videos. However, it is not realistic to store vast amounts of video data into digital archive artificially. This paper proposes a new method for the task of video digital archive management by employing scene recognition technology based on extreme learning machine (ELM). This paper only focuses on scene recognition technology which is the key step of digital video archive management. Dense scale invariant feature transform (dense SIFT) features are used as features in this proposed method. The 15-Scenes dataset with more than 4000 images is used. Experimental results have shown that this proposed method achieves not only high recognition accuracy but also extremely low computational cost. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Sports video analysis tools are gaining enormous popularity as they enable enhanced visualization and analysis of the game. An intriguing problem is localizing and tracking the ball in a game of tennis. However, achieving a practically suitable tradeoff between high detection accuracy and speed of the ball is a challenging problem in automatic ball tracking algorithms. In this paper, we propose a machine learning based automated ball tracking algorithm in tennis match videos acquired by a camera mounted on a quadcopter. We begin with applying a video stabilization technique followed by random forest segmentation for detecting tennis ball candidates in the video frames. The yellow color plane intensity and Phase Quaternion Fourier Transform (PQFT) saliency are used as features for random forest segmentation. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on datasets from real-world tennis videos. The experimental results show that our algorithm is robust and achieves 94% accuracy in best case and successfully detects the ball even in cases of partial occlusion by net or racket. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Today, there are two major paradigms for vision-based autonomous driving systems: mediated perception approaches that parse an entire scene to make a driving decision, and behavior reflex approaches that directly map an input image to a driving action by a regressor. In this paper, we propose a third paradigm: a direct perception approach to estimate the affordance for driving. We propose to map an input image to a small number of key perception indicators that directly relate to the affordance of a road/traffic state for driving. Our representation provides a set of compact yet complete descriptions of the scene to enable a simple controller to drive autonomously. Falling in between the two extremes of mediated perception and behavior reflex, we argue that our direct perception representation provides the right level of abstraction. To demonstrate this, we train a deep Convolutional Neural Network using recording from 12 hours of human driving in a video game and show that our model can work well to drive a car in a very diverse set of virtual environments. We also train a model for car distance estimation on the KITTI dataset. Results show that our direct perception approach can generalize well to real driving images.

abstract={Tracking players in sports videos presents numerous challenges due to weak distinguishing features and unpredictable motion. Considerable work has been done to track players in such videos using a combination of appearance and motion modeling, mostly in continuous streams of video. However, in a broadcast sports video, having advertisements, replays and intermittent change of camera view, it becomes a challenging task to keep track of players over an entire game. In this work, we solve a novel problem of tracking over a sequence of temporally disjoint soccer videos without the use of appearance cue, using a Graph based optimization approach. Each team is represented by a graph, in which the nodes correspond to player positions and the edge weights depend on spatial inter-player distance. We use team formation to associate tracks between clips and provide an end-to-end system that is able to perform statistical and tactical analysis of the game. We also introduce a new challenging dataset of an international soccer game. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Human activity recognition is a fundamental problem in computer vision with many applications such as video retrieval, automatic visual surveillance and human computer interaction. Sports represent one of the most viewed content on digital tv and the web. Automatically collected statistics of team sports game play represent actionable information for many end users such as coaches and broadcast speakers. Many computer vision methods applied to sport activity classification are often based on multi-camera setups, player tracking and exploit information on the ground-plane. In this work we overcome this limitations and propose an approach that exploits the spatio-temporal structure of a video grouping local spatio-temporal features unsupervisedly. Our robust representation allows to measure video similarity making correspondences among arbitrary patterns. We tested our method on two dataset of Volleyball and Soccer actions outperforming previous results by a large margin. Finally we show how our representation allows to highlight discriminative regions for each action. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A decade ago volume visualization required costly workstations due to the high processing cost for visualization. Nowadays and with the rapid development of mobile graphics, opportunities to provide volume visualization on mobile devices have been increased. New graphic application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed as worthy candidates to support the volume rendering core. This paper focused especially on OpenGL ES and Metal APIs. OpenGL ES is a cross-platform API designed especially for embedded systems; such as smartphones, computer tablets, video game consoles and personal digital assistants (PDAs). Metal is a low-level, low-overhead hardware- accelerated graphics and compute API that debuted in iOS 8. It combines functionality similar to OpenGL and OpenCL under one API. This paper shed a light on the performance gained by Metal over OpenGL ES by implemented two applications for texture mapping; each of them uses different API and compare the rendering time.

abstract={Multi-player online battle arena games (MOBAs) are large virtual environments requiring complex problem-solving and social interaction. We asked whether these games generate psychologically interesting data about the players themselves. Specifically, we asked whether user names, which are chosen by players outside of the game itself, predicted in-game behaviour. To examine this, we analysed a large anonymized dataset from a popular MOBA ('League of Legends') - by some measures the most popular game in the world. We find that user names contain two pieces of information that correlate with in-game social behaviour. Both player age (estimated from numerical sequences within name) and the presence of highly anti-social words are correlated with the valences of player/player interactions within the game. Our findings suggest that players' real-world characteristics influence behaviour and interpersonal interactions within online games. Anonymized statistics derived from such games may therefore be a valuable tool for studying psychological traits across global populations. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Detecting groups is becoming of relevant interest as an important step for scene (and especially activity) understanding. Differently from what is commonly assumed in the computer vision community, different types of groups do exist, and among these, standing conversational groups (a.k.a. F-formations) play an important role. An F-formation is a common type of people aggregation occurring when two or more persons sustain a social interaction, such as a chat at a cocktail party. Indeed, detecting and subsequently classifying such an interaction in images or videos is of considerable importance in many applicative contexts, like surveillance, social signal processing, social robotics or activity classification, to name a few. This paper presents a principled method to approach to this problem grounded upon the socio-psychological concept of an F-formation. More specifically, a game-theoretic framework is proposed, aimed at modeling the spatial structure characterizing F-formations. In other words, since F-formations are subject to geometrical configurations on how humans have to be mutually located and oriented, the proposed solution is able to account for these constraints while also statistically modeling the uncertainty associated with the position and orientation of the engaged persons. Moreover, taking advantage of video data, it is also able to integrate temporal information over multiple frames utilizing the recent notions from multi-payoff evolutionary game theory. The experiments have been performed on several benchmark datasets, consistently showing the superiority of the proposed approach over the state of the art, and its robustness under severe noise conditions. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={4D multi-view reconstruction of moving actors has many applications in the entertainment industry and although studios providing such services become more accessible, efforts have to be done in order to improve the underlying technology to produce high-quality 4D contents. In this paper, we present a method to derive a time-evolving surface representation from a sequence of binary volumetric data representing an arbitrary motion in order to introduce coherence in the data. The context is provided by an indoor multi-camera system which performs synchronized video captures from multiple viewpoints in a chroma-key studio. Our input is given by a volumetric silhouette-based reconstruction algorithm that generates a visual hull at each frame of the video sequence. These 3D volumetric models lack temporal coherence, in terms of structure and topology, as each frame is generated independently. This prevents an easy post-production editing with 3D animation tools. Our goal is to transform this input sequence of independent 3D volumes into a single dynamic structure, directly usable in post-production. Our approach is based on a motion estimation procedure. An unsigned distance function on the volumes is used as the main shape descriptor and a 3D surface matching algorithm minimizes the interference between unrelated surface regions. Experimental results, tested on our multi-view datasets, show that our method outperforms other approaches based on optical flow when considering robustness over several frames. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Conflict analysis has been used as an important tool in economic, business, governmental and political dispute, games, management negotiations, military operations and etc. There are many mathematical formal models have been proposed to handle conflict situations and one of the most popular is rough set theory. With the ability to handle vagueness from the conflict data set, rough set theory has been successfully used. However, computational time is still an issue when determining the certainty, coverage, and strength of conflict situations. In this paper, we present an alternative approach to handle conflict situations, based on some ideas using soft set theory. The novelty of the proposed approach is that, unlike in rough set theory that uses decision rules, it is based on the concept of co-occurrence of parameters in soft set theory. We illustrate the proposed approach by means of a tutorial example of voting analysis in conflict situations. Furthermore, we elaborate the proposed approach on real world dataset of political conflict in Indonesian Parliament. We show that, the proposed approach achieves lower computational time as compared to rough set theory of up to 3.9%. © 2016 Sutoyo et al.

abstract={In the construction industry, competitive bidding has long been used as a method for contractor selection. Because the true cost of construction is not known until the completion of the project, adverse selection is a major concern. Adverse selection is when the winner of the contract has underestimated the project's true cost. Thus, the winning contractor will most likely earn negative or at least below normal profits. The winner's curse is when the winning bidder submits an underestimated bid and is thus cursed by being selected to undertake the project. In the multistage bidding environment, where subcontractors are hired by a general contractor, the winner's curse may be compounded. In general, contractors suffer from the winner's curse for a variety of reasons including inaccurate estimates of project cost; new contractors entering the construction market; minimizing losses in case of recession of the construction industry; strong competition within the construction market; differential opportunity costs, which can affect the behavior of contractors; and the intention to win the project and then remedy the losses through change orders, claims, and other mechanisms. Using a game theory approach, this paper aims to analyze - and potentially reduce - industry exposure to the effects of the winner's curse in construction bidding. To this end, the authors identify the degree of the winner's curse in two common construction bidding environments; namely, single-stage bidding and multistage bidding. The objective is to compare the aforementioned two construction bidding environments and determine how learning from past bidding decisions and experiences can mitigate the winner's curse. To this end, and through defining the relationship between the construction bidding and auction theory, the authors utilized a three-step research methodology that involved (1) presenting the symmetric risk neutral Nash equilibrium (SRNNE) as an optimal bid function; (2) developing simulation models for single and multistage construction bidding processes; and (3) analyzing the results of the simulation models, which is based on an actual dataset of projects provided by the California Department of Transportation. This research demonstrated that the majority of general contractors and subcontractors suffer from the winner's curse in both single-stage and multistage bidding environments. Moreover, from a winner's curse perspective, the multistage bidding environment incurs more losses than the single-stage bidding environment. However, through learning from past experiences, the multistage bidding environment provides contractors with a better opportunity to avoid the winner's curse if compared with the single-stage bidding environment. This research should be beneficial for the profession to better understand the bidding decision-making processes. For future work, cooperative game theory can be applied with the integrated project delivery principles to help all associated parties mutually achieve their project objectives. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={We use four statistics data from the NBA regular season including team comprehensive score, player comprehensive score, chief coach capability, and the impact of home and away games as the indicators to build up training samples. Then, we construct a prediction model based on a support vector machine (SVM), which is suitable for solving the problem of a small sample size and has the theoretical basis of structural risk minimization. We combine the technique of undersampling and oversampling to remove the unbalanced data in training datasets, thus improving the leaning ability of SVM. Experimental results show that the proposed method has a relatively preferable performance. © 2016, Science Press. All right reserved.},

abstract={We address the space complexity challenge in largegraph clustering using quadratic programming, and present acomprehensive technical analysis and alternative solution based on game theoretic concepts. We develop an approximate solution to the problem of clustering graphs with a large number of vertices in order to overcome the space complexity issues. Particularly, the edge weights between every pair of vertices are required which proves practically intractable for large data sets. Our scalable method divides a graph into disjoint tractable size subgraphs, where their clusters are enumerated based on a novel solution space search. Then, the clusters obtained in each subgraph are grouped using a low resolution ensemble clustering method. The exact maxima of the quadratic programming problem on the entire graph is approximated by the maxima of the subsets of the graph. Finally, vertices are assigned to the final clusters using a linear game theoretic relation. We also propose the question «How can a cluster of a subset of a dataset be a cluster of the entire dataset?». We show that, in the quadratic programming framework, this problem is coNP-hard. Hence, we modify the definition of a cluster from a stable concept to a non-stable but optimal one (Nash equilibrium) that makes it computationally practical to find clusters in graphs with large numbers of vertices. On the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset, the proposed method achieves results comparable to the state of the art, providing a parallel framework for image segmentation. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine learning and data mining have become ubiquitous tools in modern computing applications and large enterprise systems benefit from its adaptability and intelligent ability to infer patterns that can be used for prediction or decision-making. Great success has been achieved by applying machine learning and data mining to the security settings for large dataset, such as in intrusion detection, virus detection, biometric identity recognition, and spam filtering. However, the strengths of the learning systems, such as the adaptability and ability to infer patterns, can also become their vulnerabilities when there are adversarial manipulations during the learning and predicting process. Considering the fact that the traditional learning strategies could potentially introduce security faults into the learning systems, robust machine learning techniques against the sophisticated adversaries need to be studied, which is referred to as secure learning and mining through this abstract. Based on the goal of secure learning and mining, I aim to analyze the behavior of learning systems in adversarial environments by studying different kinds of attacks against the learning systems. Then design robust learning algorithms to counter the corresponding malicious behaviors based on the evaluation and prediction of the adversaries' goal and capabilities. The interactions between the defender and attackers are modeled as different forms of games, therefore game theoretic analysis are applied to evaluate and predict the constraints for both participants to deal with the real world large dataset. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={There are different functional regions in cities such as tourist attractions, shopping centers, workplaces and residential places. The human mobility patterns for different functional regions are different, e.g., people usually go to work during daytime on weekdays, and visit shopping centers after work. In this paper, we analyse urban human mobility patterns and infer the functions of the regions in three cities. The analysis is based on three large taxi GPS datasets in Rome, San Francisco and Beijing containing 21 million, 11 million and 17 million GPS points respectively. We categorized the city regions into four kinds of places, work-places, entertainment places, residential places and other places. First, we provide a new quad-tree region division method based on the taxi visits. Second, we use the association rule to infer the functional regions in these three cities according to temporal human mobility patterns. Third, we show that these identified functional regions can help us delivering data in network applications, such as urban Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), more efficiently. The new functional-regions-based DTNs algorithm achieves up to 183% improvement in terms of delivery ratio. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Tropical forests are the global cornerstone of biological diversity, and store 55% of the forest carbon stock globally, yet sustained provisioning of these forest ecosystem services may be threatened by hunting-induced extinctions of plant-animal mutualisms that maintain long-term forest dynamics. Large-bodied Atelinae primates and tapirs in particular offer nonredundant seed-dispersal services for many large-seeded Neotropical tree species, which on average have higher wood density than smaller-seeded and winddispersed trees. We used field data and models to project the spatial impact of hunting on large primates by ∼1 million rural households throughout the Brazilian Amazon. We then used a unique baseline dataset on 2,345 1-ha tree plots arrayed across the Brazilian Amazon to model changes in aboveground forest biomass under different scenarios of hunting-induced large-bodied frugivore extirpation. We project that defaunation of the most harvest-sensitive species will lead to losses in aboveground biomass of between 2.5-5.8% on average, with some losses as high as 26.5-37.8%. These findings highlight an urgent need to manage the sustainability of game hunting in both protected and unprotected tropical forests, and place full biodiversity integrity, including populations of large frugivorous vertebrates, firmly in the agenda of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) programs.},

Taking these clusters into account together with low-rank structure may yield parsimonious matrix and tensor factorization models and more powerful data analytics. Prior works made use of data-domain similarity to improve nonnegative matrix factorization. Here we are instead interested in joint low-rank factorization and latent-domain clustering; that is, in clustering the latent reduced-dimension representations of the observed entities. A unified algorithmic framework that can deal with both matrix and tensor factorization and latent clustering is proposed.

The proposed application context based rating algorithm functions as an extension of the underlying (unmodified) player rating algorithm by adjusting the rating update step and can thus be applied for different rating systems in MOBA games.

However, misclassification between game bots and hard-core users is the well-known problem for a long time. In this paper, we define the growth types by analyzing the growth processes of users with the Aion dataset, one of the famous MMORPGs in the world. We propose a framework that classifies hard-core users and game bots in the growth patterns. As a result, we successfully distinguish game bots from hard-core users with high accuracy value. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Twitch is a streaming platform that lets users broadcast their screen whilst playing games. People can share their game experience and interact with others in real time. Twitch has now become the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic in the US. This paper explores the unique nature of this platform over a 11 month dataset. We find that Twitch is very different to existing video platforms, with a small number of games consistently achieving phenomenal dominance. We find a complex game ecosystem combining consistently popular games over years, newly released games enjoying bursts of popularity, and even old games appearing on the platform. Despite a strong skew of views across channels, the top ranked channels, although taking a significant share of the viewers, exhibit unexpectedly high churn. The reason behind this churn lies within another unique feature of this ecosystem, namely tournaments, live events that last for a limited amount of time but are capable of attracting a huge share of views when they take place, as well as dominate the views of the related games. Overall, our work reveals a complex and rich ecosystem, very different from existing user generated content platforms. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Current recommender systems exploit user and item similarities by collaborative filtering. Some advanced methods also consider the temporal evolution of item ratings as a global background process. However, all prior methods disregard the individual evolution of a user's experience level and how this is expressed in the user's writing in a review community. In this paper, we model the joint evolution of user experience, interest in specific item facets, writing style, and rating behavior. This way we can generate individual recommendations that take into account the user's maturity level (e.g., recommending art movies rather than blockbusters for a cinematography expert). As only item ratings and review texts are observables, we capture the user's experience and interests in a latent model learned from her reviews, vocabulary and writing style. We develop a generative HMM-LDA model to trace user evolution, where the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) traces her latent experience progressing over time - with solely user reviews and ratings as observables over time. The facets of a user's interest are drawn from a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model derived from her reviews, as a function of her (again latent) experience level. In experiments with four realworld datasets, we show that our model improves the rating prediction over state-of-the-art baselines, by a substantial margin. In addition, our model can also give some interpretations for the user experience level. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Cheap ubiquitous computing enables the collection of massive amounts of personal data in a wide variety of domains. Many organizations aimto share such data while obscuring features that could discloseidentities or other sensitive information. Much of the data now collected exhibits weak structure (e.g., natural language text) and machine learning approaches have been developed to identify andremove sensitive entities in such data. Learning-based approaches are never perfect and relying upon them tosanitize datacan leak sensitive information as a consequence. However, a small amount of risk is permissible in practice, and, thus, our goal is to balance the value of datapublished and the risk of an adversary discovering leaked sensitiveinformation. We model data sanitization as a game between1) a publisher who chooses a set of classifiers to apply to data andpublishes only instances predicted to be non-sensitive and 2) an attackerwho combines machine learning and manual inspection to uncover leakedsensitive entities (e.g., personal names). We introduce aniterative greedy algorithm for the publisher that provablyexecutes no more than a linear number of iterations, and ensures a lowutility for a resource-limited adversary. Moreover, using several real world natural language corpora, weillustrate that our greedy algorithm leaves virtually no automaticallyidentifiable sensitive instances for a state-of-the-art learningalgorithm, while sharing over 93% of the original data, and completesafter at most 5 iterations. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Ensemble methodology has proved to be one of the strongest machine learning techniques. In spite of its huge success, most ensemble methods tend to generate unnecessary large number of classifiers, which entails an increase in memory storage, computational cost, and even a reduction of the generalization performance of the ensemble. Ensemble selection addresses these shortcomings by searching for a fraction of individual classifiers that performs as good as, or better than the entire ensemble. In this paper, we formulate the problem of ensemble selection as a coalitional game in a graph form, and name the approach ISCG-Ranking. The proposed game aims at capturing two crucial concepts that affect the performance of an ensemble: accuracy and diversity. Most importantly, it ranks every classifier based on its contribution in keeping a proper balance between these two notions using Shapley value. To demonstrate the validity and the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we carried out experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art techniques on 26 UCI benchmark datasets. The results reveal that ISCG-Ranking significantly improves the original ensemble and performs better than other methods in most cases. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={ABSTRACT: In contemporary media management, the sharing of news articles among readers’ family, friends, and social circle is vital to the media outlet’s reaching a wide audience and building engagement. As the use of social media is becoming more integrated into the core strategy of many businesses, the propensity to share news has become a key metric to measure and understand media impact. Although existing literature suggests that increasing the centrality of news sharing has become an important factor in audience engagement, empirical evidence of the influence of news sharing is sparse. The challenges in motivating news readers to share in the media environment call for research on the characteristics that predict the spreading of news. In this regard, we investigate how textual characteristics of news articles influence sharing activities. Using a publicly available secondary dataset of 39,797 records from Mashable, we build a decision tree and conducted regression analysis to identify the factors that are most influential in terms of sharing. We find that subjective writing style, polar sentiments expressed in the title of an article, and embedded content, such as external links and images, are positively associated with number of shares. In addition, we find that sharing of articles occurs more often through social media channels than through other special interest websites (e.g., entertainment, business) and more frequently on weekends. We provide managerial insights into the economics of the contemporary news business and guidelines to measure, monetize, and analyze audience engagement based on the sharing process. © 2016 Institute for Media and Communications Management.},

abstract={The iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD) is well known within the domain of game theory. Although it is relatively simple, it can also elucidate important problems related to cooperation and trust. Generally, players can predict their opponents' actions when they are able to build a precise model of their behavior based on their game playing experience. However, it is difficult to make such predictions based on a limited number of games. The creation of a precise model requires the use of not only an appropriate learning algorithm and framework but also a good dataset. Active learning approaches have recently been introduced to machine learning communities. The approach can usually produce informative datasets with relatively little effort. Therefore, we have proposed an active modeling technique to predict the behavior of IPD players. The proposed method can model the opponent player's behavior while taking advantage of interactive game environments. This experiment used twelve representative types of players as opponents, and an observer used an active modeling algorithm to model these opponents. This observer actively collected data and modeled the opponent's behavior online. Most of our data showed that the observer was able to build, through direct actions, a more accurate model of an opponent's behavior than when the data were collected through random actions. © 2016 Hyunsoo Park and Kyung-Joong Kim.},

UMIETM (1) exploits user modeling’s information to discover events, which usually capture attentions from users with different interests, and (2) treats the arriving data as stream and run the detection in online learning style. Furthermore, UMIETM can handle dynamic increased vocabulary in tweet stream. The UMIETM is verified on the real dataset which spans one year and contains 16 million tweets, and it outperforms state-of-the-art models in quantitative. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Entertainment shopping supported by pay-to-bid auction is an emerging online business model in recent years. Consumers expect both entertainment value and monetary return from their participation in entertainment shopping. We propose a dynamic structural model to study consumers' online shopping behavior. We analyze the learning process of consumers from two perspectives based on the Bayesian updating framework: (1) consumers update their beliefs about the entertainment value through their repeated personal participation experiences, and (2) consumers infer the expected monetary payoffs on the website by observing the publically available auction ending price information. We estimate the model using a large dataset from an entertainment shopping website. The results show that consumers generally show risk-seeking preferences. They significantly overestimate the entertainment value but underestimate the level of competition at the beginning of their participation, which helps to explain the observed decreasing participation rate over time. Through counterfactual policy simulations, we discuss the website design implications and recommend strategies to create a sustainable business model.},

However, it was reported that its effectiveness depends on a dataset, and item coverage tends to be lower than conventional user-based CF.

abstract={Recent progress in computer vision has been driven by highcapacity models trained on large datasets. Unfortunately, creating large datasets with pixel-level labels has been extremely costly due to the amount of human effort required. In this paper, we present an approach to rapidly creating pixel-accurate semantic label maps for images extracted from modern computer games. Although the source code and the internal operation of commercial games are inaccessible, we show that associations between image patches can be reconstructed from the communication between the game and the graphics hardware. This enables rapid propagation of semantic labels within and across images synthesized by the game, with no access to the source code or the content. We validate the presented approach by producing dense pixel-level semantic annotations for 25 thousand images synthesized by a photorealistic openworld computer game. Experiments on semantic segmentation datasets show that using the acquired data to supplement real-world images significantly increases accuracy and that the acquired data enables reducing the amount of hand-labeled real-world data: models trained with game data and just 1/3 of the CamVid training set outperform models trained on the complete CamVid training set. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={Prediction of user interest and behavior is currently an important research area in social network analysis. Most of the current prediction frameworks rely on analyzing user's published contents and user's relationships. Recently the dynamic nature of user's modelling has been introduced in the prediction frameworks. This dynamic nature would be represented by time tagged attributes such as posts or location check-ins. In this paper, we study the relationships between geo-location information published by users at different times. This geo-location information was used to model user's interest and behavior in order to enhance prediction of user locations. Furthermore, semantic features such as topics of interest and location category were extracted from this information in order to overcome sparsity of data. Several experiments on real twitter dataset showed that the proposed context-based prediction model which applies machine learning techniques outperformed traditional probabilistic location prediction model that only rely on words extracted from tweets associated with specific locations.

abstract={In this article we propose a new model for document clustering, based on game theoretic principles. Each document to be clustered is represented as a player, in the game theoretic sense, and each cluster as a strategy that the players have to choose in order to maximize their payoff. The geometry of the data is modeled as a graph, which encodes the pairwise similarity among each document and the games are played among similar players. In each game the players update their strategies, according to what strategy has been effective in previous games. The Dominant Set clustering algorithm is used to find the prototypical elements of each cluster. This information is used in order to divide the players in two disjoint sets, one collecting labeled players, which always play a definite strategy and the other one collecting unlabeled players, which update their strategy at each iteration of the games. The evaluation of the system was conducted on 13 document datasets and shows that the proposed method performs well compared to different document clustering algorithms. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Although various techniques have been proposed for automatically detecting affective states using facial expression, this is still a research challenge in terms of classification accuracy. This paper investigates an extensible automatic affective state detection approach via the analysis of facial expressions from digital photographs. The main contribution of this study can be summarised in two points. Firstly, utilising facial point distance vectors within the representation of facial expressions is shown to be more accurate and robust in comparison to using standard Cartesian coordinates. Secondly, employing a two-stage Support Vector Machine-based classification model, entitled Hierarchical Parallelised Binary Support Vector Machines (HPBSVM), is shown to improve classification performance over other machine learning techniques. The resulting classification model has been evaluated using two different facial expression datasets (namely CKPLUS and KDEF), yielding accuracy rates of 96.9% and 96.2% over each dataset respectively. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

These principles usually assume some probability distribution for the data. These approaches also fail to capture the individual contribution of every feature in a given set of features. In this paper, we propose an approach which uses the Relief algorithm and cooperative game theory to solve the problems mentioned above.

abstract={With the rapid development of Web 2.0 and interactive technologies, learning resources are proliferating online. Confronting such large volume of educational data, users require effective and efficient methodologies to organize and manage them, which reveals the importance of clustering. In this paper, we first propose a method to estimate the data density, and then apply it to merge learning resources. The proposed algorithm estimates the confidence of any two learning resources to be a pair of neighbors, and conducts clustering by combining the above confidence with the similarities among resources. Experiments are designed to evaluate the performance of our algorithm using the standard clustering datasets. We also demonstrate how to employ the proposed algorithm in educational applications, including e-learner grouping, resource recommendation and usage patterns discovery. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={The paper presents the result on cross-representation mediation of user models in the context of movie recommendation. We analyze the possibility of initializing the user models for a content-based recommender starting from movie ratings provided by users in other social applications. We focus in particular on (i) an approach for inferring user model preferences from rating and (ii) the experimentation of several methods to determine default user-model preferences from community-based ratings. We tested different variations of the proposed approach exploiting a subset of the MovieLens 10M Dataset, computing rating predictions, and analyzing the mean absolute error between such predictions and the actual ratings provided by users. The results show that the approach is in general feasible, with MAEs decreasing for users who provided more ratings and stabilizing around 0.15. They also show that community-based ratings are best used by inferring from them an "average user model", whose preferences can fill in missing values from individual user models.},

abstract={Recommender systems rely on techniques of predicting the ratings that users would give to yet unconsumed items. Probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) is a standard technique for such prediction and makes a prediction on the basis of an underlying probabilistic generative model of the behavior of users. We investigate a new model of users' consumption and rating, where a user tends to consume an item that emphasizes those features that the user seeks to enjoy, and the ratings of the users are more strongly affected by those features than others. We incorporate this new user model into PMF and show that the resulting method, Gated PMF (GPMF), improves the predictive accuracy by several percent on standard datasets. GPMF is widely applicable, as it is trained only with the ratings given by users and does not rely on any auxiliary data.},

abstract={In this paper, we aim to deter urban crime by recommending optimal police patrol strategies against opportunistic criminals in large scale urban problems. While previous work has tried to learn criminals' behavior from real world data and generate patrol strategies against opportunistic crimes, it cannot scale up to large-scale urban problems. Our first contribution is a game abstraction framework that can handle opportunistic crimes in large-scale urban areas. In this game abstraction framework, we model the interaction between officers and opportunistic criminals as a game with discrete targets. By merging similar targets, we obtain an abstract game with fewer total targets. We use real world data to learn and plan against opportunistic criminals in this abstract game, and then propagate the results of this abstract game back to the original game. Our second contribution is the layer-generating algorithm used to merge targets as described in the framework above. This algorithm applies a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to merge similar and geographically neighboring targets in the large scale problem. As our third contribution, we propose a planning algorithm that recommends a mixed strategy against opportunistic criminals. Finally, our fourth contribution is a heuristic propagation model to handle the problem of limited data we occasionally encounter in large-scale problems. As part of our collaboration with local police departments, we apply our model in two large scale urban problems: a university campus and a city. Our approach provides high prediction accuracy in the real datasets; furthermore, we project significant crime rate reduction using our planning strategy compared to current police strategy.

abstract={Citizen science projects have been very successful at collecting rich datasets for different applications. However, the data collected by the citizen scientists are often biased, more aligned with the citizens' preferences rather than scientific objectives. We introduce a novel two-stage game for reducing data-bias in citizen science in which the game organizer, a citizen-science program, incentivizes the agents, the citizen scientists, to visit under-sampled areas. We provide a novel way of encoding this two-stage game as a single optimization problem, cleverly folding (an approximation of) the agents' problems into the organizer's problem. We present several new algorithms to solve this optimization problem as well as a new structural SVM approach to learn the parameters that capture the agents' behaviors, under different incentive schemes. We apply our methodology to eBird, a well-established citizen-science program for collecting bird observations, as a game called Avicaching. We deployed Avicaching in two New York counties (March 2015), with a great response from the birding community, surpassing the expectations of the eBird organizers and bird-conservation experts. The field results show that the Avicaching incentives are remarkably effective at encouraging the bird watchers to explore under-sampled areas and hence alleviate the eBird's data bias problem.

abstract={With the Web 2.0 and its services, the users are able to express their own emotions through the production and sharing of multimedia contents. In this context, we can interpret the flood of selfies that everyday invades the web as the will to overcome the limits of the textual communication. Therefore, it becomes particularly interesting the possibility to extract in an automatic way information about the emotional state of the people present in the multimedia content. The knowledge of a person's emotional state gives useful information for the personalization of many online services. Some examples of the areas where such an approach can be adopted are the services for the content recommendation, for the entertainment and for the distance training. In this paper, the techniques of sentiment extraction from multimedia contents will be applied to the sports world. In particular, the aim is to verify the possibility to predict the result of a penalty kick analyzing the player's face. The objective is to investigate the possibility to evaluate in real time the psychic conditions of an athlete during a competition. The system has been tested on an opportunely built dataset and the results are more than satisfying. Copyright © 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

But creating realistic virtual worlds is not easy. The game industry, however, has spent a lot of effort creating 3D worlds, which a player can interact with. So researchers can build on these resources to create virtual worlds, provided we can access and modify the internal data structures of the games. To enable this we created an open-source plugin UnrealCV (Project website: http://unrealcv.github.io) for a popular game engine Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).

abstract={Image segmentation is an important problem in computer vision and has significant applications in the segmentation of cellular images. Many different imaging techniques exist and produce a variety of image properties which pose difficulties to image segmentation routines. Bright-field images are particularly challenging because of the non-uniform shape of the cells, the low contrast between cells and background, and imaging artifacts such as halos and broken edges. Classical segmentation techniques often produce poor results on these challenging images. Previous attempts at bright-field imaging are often limited in scope to the images that they segment. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for automatically segmenting cellular images. The algorithm incorporates two game theoretic models which allow each pixel to act as an independent agent with the goal of selecting their best labelling strategy. In the non-cooperative model, the pixels choose strategies greedily based only on local information. In the cooperative model, the pixels can form coalitions, which select labelling strategies that benefit the entire group. Combining these two models produces a method which allows the pixels to balance both local and global information when selecting their label. With the addition of k-means and active contour techniques for initialization and post-processing purposes, we achieve a robust segmentation routine. The algorithm is applied to several cell image datasets including bright-field images, fluorescent images and simulated images. Experiments show that the algorithm produces good segmentation results across the variety of datasets which differ in cell density, cell shape, contrast, and noise levels. © 2016 SPIE.},

abstract={Multi-person event recognition is a challenging task, often with many people active in the scene but only a small subset contributing to an actual event. In this paper, we propose a model which learns to detect events in such videos while automatically "attending" to the people responsible for the event. Our model does not use explicit annotations regarding who or where those people are during training and testing. In particular, we track people in videos and use a recurrent neural network (RNN) to represent the track features. We learn time-varying attention weights to combine these features at each time-instant. The attended features are then processed using another RNN for event detection/classification. Since most video datasets with multiple people are restricted to a small number of videos, we also collected a new basketball dataset comprising 257 basketball games with 14K event annotations corresponding to 11 event classes. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both event classification and detection on this new dataset. Additionally, we show that the attention mechanism is able to consistently localize the relevant players.},

abstract={Context: Analysis of injury and illness data collected at large international competitions provides the US Olympic Committee and the national governing bodies for each sport with information to best prepare for future competitions. Research in which authors have evaluated medical contacts to provide the expected level of medical care and sports medicine services at international competitions is limited. Objective: To analyze the medical-contact data for athletes, staff, and coaches who participated in the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara, Mexico, using unsupervised modeling techniques to identify underlying treatment patterns. Design: Descriptive epidemiology study. Setting: Pan American Games. Patients or Other Participants: A total of 618 US athletes (337 males, 281 females) participated in the 2011 Pan American Games. Main Outcome Measure(s): Medical data were recorded from the injury-evaluation and injury-treatment forms used by clinicians assigned to the central US Olympic Committee Sport Medicine Clinic and satellite locations during the operational 17-day period of the 2011 Pan American Games. We used principal components analysis and agglomerative clustering algorithms to identify and define grouped modalities. Lift statistics were calculated for within-cluster subgroups. Results: Principal component analyses identified 3 components, accounting for 72.3% of the variability in datasets. Plots of the principal components showed that individual contacts focused on 4 treatment clusters: massage, paired manipulation and mobilization, soft tissue therapy, and general medical. Conclusions: Unsupervised modeling techniques were useful for visualizing complex treatment data and provided insights for improved treatment modeling in athletes. Given its ability to detect clinically relevant treatment pairings in large datasets, unsupervised modeling should be considered a feasible option for future analyses of medical-contact data from international competitions. © by the National Athletic Trainers' Association, Inc.},

abstract={The Cropland Capture game, which is a recently developed Geo-Wiki game, aims to map cultivated lands using around 17,000 satellite images from the Earth’s surface. Using a perceptual hash and blur detection algorithm, we improve the quality of the Cropland Capture game’s dataset. We then benchmark state-ofthe-art algorithms for an aggregation of votes using results of well-known machine learning algorithms as a baseline. We demonstrate that volunteer-image assignment is highly irregular and only good annotators are presented (there are no spammers and malicious voters).We conjecture that the last fact is the main reason for surprisingly similar accuracy levels across all examined algorithms. Finally, we increase the estimated consistency with expert opinion from 77 to 91% and up to 96% if we restrict our attention to images with more than 9 votes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={In many real-world reinforcement learning problems, we have access to an existing dataset and would like to use it to evaluate various learning approaches. Typically, one would prefer not to deploy a fixed policy, but rather an algorithm that learns to improve its behavior as it gains more experience. Therefore, we seek to evaluate how a proposed algorithm learns in our environment, meaning we need to evaluate how an algorithm would have gathered experience if it were run online. In this work, we develop three new evaluation approaches which guarantee that, given some history, algorithms are fed samples from the distribution that they would have encountered if they were run online. Additionally, we are the first to propose an approach that is provably unbiased given finite data, eliminating bias due to the length of the evaluation. Finally, we compare the sample-efficiency of these approaches on multiple datasets, including one from a real-world deployment of an educational game. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={Baseball is a statistically filled sport, and predicting the winner of a particular Major League Baseball (MLB) game is an interesting and challenging task. Up to now, there is no definitive formula for determining what factors will conduct a team to victory, but through the analysis of many years of historical records many trends could emerge. Recent studies concentrated on using and generating new statistics called sabermetrics in order to rank teams and players according to their perceived strengths and consequently applying these rankings to forecast specific games. In this paper, we employ sabermetrics statistics with the purpose of assessing the predictive capabilities of four data mining methods (classification and regression based) for predicting outcomes (win or loss) in MLB regular season games. Our model approach uses only past data when making a prediction, corresponding to ten years of publicly available data. We create a dataset with accumulative sabermetrics statistics for each MLB team during this period for which data contamination is not possible. The inherent difficulties of attempting this specific sports prediction are confirmed using two geometry or topology based measures of data complexity. Results reveal that the classification predictive scheme forecasts game outcomes better than regression scheme, and of the four data mining methods used, SVMs produce the best predictive results with a mean of nearly 60% prediction accuracy for each team. The evaluation of our model is performed using stratified 10-fold cross-validation.},

abstract={Wildlife poaching presents a serious extinction threat to many animal species. Agencies ("defenders") focused on protecting such animals need tools that help analyze, model and predict poacher activities, so they can more effectively combat such poaching; such tools could also assist in planning effective defender patrols, building on the previous security games research. To that end, we have built a new predictive anti-poaching tool, CAPTURE (Comprehensive Anti-Poaching tool with Temporal and observation Uncertainty REasoning). CAPTURE provides four main contributions. First, CAPTURE's modeling of poachers provides significant advances over previous models from behavioral game theory and conservation biology. This accounts for: (i) the defender's imperfect detection of poaching signs; (ii) complex temporal dependencies in the poacher's behaviors; (iii) lack of knowledge of numbers of poachers. Second, we provide two new heuristics: parameter separation and target abstraction to reduce the computational complexity in learning the poacher models. Third, we present a new game-theoretic algorithm for computing the defender's optimal patrolling given the complex poacher model. Finally, we present detailed models and analysis of real-world poaching data collected over 12 years in Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda to evaluate our new model's prediction accuracy. This paper thus presents the largest dataset of real-world defender-adversary interactions analyzed in the security games literature. CAPTURE will be tested in Uganda in early 2016.

abstract={Objective: Author Profiling is a text classification technique to predict the author profiles of anonymous text. Author Profiles are the demographic characteristics of the authors like age, gender, native language, location, educational background and personality traits. This paper proposes a new model to predict the profiles of the authors such as gender and age by analyzing their writing styles on hotel reviews dataset. Method: Most of the existing approaches suffer from high dimensionality of features and capturing the relationship between the features. In this paper, a Profile specific Document Weighted approach is proposed to address the drawbacks of existing approaches. In the proposed model, the pivoted unique term normalization measure is used to calculate the weight of the terms specific to each profile group. Document weight specific to each profile group is calculated as the sum of individual term weights of the specific group. A document vector has constructed using the weight of each group of a profile in the document. Findings: An anonymous document profile has identified using the model generated by the machine learning classifier. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated with various classifiers using accuracy as a measure. The proposed approach is experimented on reviews domain to predict the gender and age group of the authors. For gender prediction, the proposed model trained on Naïve Bayes Multinomial classifier results to good accuracy of 91.50%. The logistic classifier results to good accuracy of 81.58% on the proposed model. The results achieved in this paper that outperforms most of the existing approaches. Applications: Author Profiling became popular in several information technologies enabled applications such as marketing, forensic analysis, psychology and entertainment. Using reviews dataset on hotels, the business analysts can take strategic decisions to improve the business by identifying the individual profile groups based on the customer reviews.},

In this paper, we study the gamification of machine learning techniques; in particular, the problem of classification of objects. In this first pilot study, we designed a simple game, based on a visual interpretation of probabilistic classifiers, that consists in separating two sets of coloured points on a two-dimensional plane by means of a straight line. We present the current results of this first experiment that we used to collect the requirements for the next version of the game and to analyze i) what is the 'price' to build a reasonably accurate classifier with a small amount of labelled objects, ii) and compare the accuracy of the player to the state-of-the-art classification algorithms.

abstract={Facial expression datasets are currently limited as most of them only capture the emotional expressions of adults. Researchers have begun to assert the importance of having child exemplars of the various emotional expressions in order to study the interpretation of these expressions developmentally. Capturing children expression is more complicated as the protocols used for eliciting and recording expressions for adults are not necessarily adequate for children. This paper describes the creation of a flexible Emotional Game for capturing children faces in an engaging context. The game is inspired by the well-known Guitar HeroTM gameplay, but instead of playing notes, the player should produce series of expressions. In the current work, we measure the capacity of the game to engage the children and we discuss the requirements in terms of expression recognition needed to ensure a viable gameplay. The preliminary experiments conducted with a group of 12 children with ages between 7 and 11 in various settings and social contexts show high levels of engagement and positive feedback. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={The winner's curse is when the winning bidder submits an underestimated bid and is thus cursed by being selected to undertake the project. This paper uses game theory to identify the degree of the winner's curse in two common construction bidding environments; namely, single-stage bidding and multi-stage bidding. The objective is to compare the aforementioned two construction bidding environments, and determine how learning from past bidding decisions and experiences can mitigate from the winner's curse. To this end, the authors (1) presented the symmetric risk neutral Nash equilibrium (SRNNE) as an optimal bid function; (2) developed simulation models for single and multi-stage construction bidding processes; and (3) analyzed the results of the simulation models, which is based on an actual dataset of California Department of Transportation projects. This research demonstrated that the majority of general contractors and sub-contractors suffer from the winner's curse in both single and multi-stage bidding environments, and that the SRNNE optimal bid function provides the contractors with a tool to avoid the winner's curse problem and to consequently gain strategic positive profits in both bidding environments. This research should reduce the industry exposure to the effects of the winner's curse in construction bidding. © ASCE.},

In this study we explored the expenditure-based profile of Macao visitors using a randomly sampled dataset from a large-scale visitor profile survey supported by Macao Government Tourist Office. Utilizing self-reported actual expenditure data from 3577 visitors, we extracted six expenditure clusters of Macao visitors using a k-means clustering with silhouette analysis. The six clusters, i.e., entertainment, gambling, cuisine, shopping, both cuisine & shopping, and transit, have significant differences in expenditure preferences and expenditure levels. We also analyzed the demographic and behavior profile for each cluster. Our findings shed light on developing customized marketing strategies to the profile of each distinct expenditure cluster of Macao visitors.},

In this paper, we conduct the first large-scale analysis of weather’s impact on human mobility in cities. Focusing on a number of major cities, we construct a human mobility dataset from the social network Instagram. We discover that in general nice weather (e.g., moderate temperature and high pressure) has a positive impact on human mobility. Through analyzing mobility at locations of different categories, we further discover that human mobility is less influenced by weather at certain categories such as residences than others including stores and entertainment places. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={With the rapid development of Internet and social media, online news has become an important type of information that attracts millions of readers to express their emotions. Therefore, it is of great significance to build an emotion classifier for online news. However, it largely relies on the collection with sufficient labeled news to build an emotion classifier and the manually labeling work can be quite labor intensive. Moreover, different collections may have different domains such as politics or entertainment. Even in the same domain, different collections require different classifiers, since they have different emotion labels and feature distributions. In this paper, we focus on the task of crosscollection emotion tagging for online news. This task can be formulated as a transfer learning problem which utilizes a source collection with abundant labeled data and a target collection with limited labeled data within the same domain. We proposed a novel method to transfer knowledge from source collection to help build an emotion classifier for target collectcpn. Experimental results on four real datasets show that our method outperforms competitive baselines. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Capable and inexpensive Global Positioning System (GPS) spoofers are more likely to threaten our world today due to increased public awareness, advancement of computing power, and the advent of software defined radio technology. Just recently, the introduction of GNSS enabled augmented reality games such as Pokemon Go, has also contributed significantly to the global interest in GPS spoofing [1]. To combat this threat, several researchers are developing methods of detecting spoofing attacks [2]. Integral to these efforts are the use of pre-recorded spoofing datasets in order to test the methods being developed. The University of Texas at Austin has published datasets for evaluating spoofing mitigation techniques. These datasets, known as the Texas Spoofing Test Battery (TEXBAT), include eight separate spoofing scenarios. This paper endeavors to offer an addendum to [3, 4] with independent results, observations, and additional commentary regarding the static TEXBAT scenarios as an aid to the community of researchers utilizing this dataset. It is not the intended purpose of this paper to suggest or evaluate anti-spoofing techniques, but rather to inform the community of our observations derived from working with the TEXBAT datasets. This paper leverages an AFIT-developed high-fidelity software-based GPS receiver known as the GNSS Educational Adjustable Receiver Software (GEARS) to process and investigate the TEXBAT spoofing scenarios. This highly flexible and customizable receiver can be used to very quickly explore many different receiver observables. It is capable of subsample sized correlator spacing with carrier-aided code tracking, and utilizes a programmable state machine that dynamically reconfigures the tracking loop parameters to achieve a high degree of flexibility and accuracy [5]. Observations include the characterization of power biases and time offsets between scenarios, the discovery of a "global" code and carrier range rate divergence in some scenarios, and an accurate tabulation of the onset of spoofing in each scenario. Artifacts in the RF spectrum are also described.},

abstract={Recently, developing interaction techniques that allow gesture recognition for home application and game control is one popular field in Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) research. In this paper, we proposed a method for hand gesture recognition using artificial neural network algorithm commonly used in HCI. Previous studies have generally used distinguished distribution datasets. However, in the real world, gesture data are imbalanced. In addition, if gesture distribution data are imbalanced, it is difficult to classify gesture. To solve these problems, we present a gesture distribution feature based weighted Neural Network (FWNN) after adding trajectory distribution data to input layer before network training. Specific hand trajectory coordinate and the number of extrema of hand trajectory are added to the trajectory distribution data. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method is much more accurate than the method of using only sequence data.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a method for referring to the real world to improve named entity recognition (NER) specialized for a domain. Our method adds a stacked autoencoder to a text-based deep neural network for NER. We first train the stacked auto-encoder only from the real world information, then the entire deep neural network from sentences annotated with NEs and accompanied by real world information. In our experiments, we took Japanese chess as the example. The dataset consists of pairs of a game state and commentary sentences about it annotated with gamespecific NE tags. We conducted NER experiments and showed that referring to the real world improves the NER accuracy. © 2016 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

abstract={Motion capture data have been widely used in applications ranging from video games and animations to simulations and virtual environments. Moreover, all data-driven approaches for analysis and synthesis of motions are depending on motion capture data. Although multiple large motion capture datasets are freely available for research, there is no system which can provide a centralised access to all of them in an organised manner. In this paper, we show that using a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store data not only provide such a centralised access to the data, but also allows to include other sensor modalities (e.g., accelerometer data) and various semantic annotations. We present two applications for our system: a motion capture player where motions sequences can be retrieved from large datasets using SQL queries and the automatic construction of statistical models which can further be used for complex motion analysis and motions synthesis tasks.

abstract={Attacks on Recommender Systems (RS) tend to bias predictions and corrupt datasets, which may cause user distrust in the recommendations and dissatisfaction with the RS. Attacks on RSs are mounted by malicious users to "push" or promote an item, "nuke" or disparage an item, or simply to disrupt the recommendations; typically, attacks are motivated by financial gains, by a desire to "game" the system, or both. Although attack research indicates that item-based recommenders are resistant to a wide variety of push and nuke attacks, in previous work we have shown that push attacks on item-based recommenders can be effective using a multiple-target approach. In this paper, we explore nuke attacks on item-based recommenders using a multiple-target approach and variations on the Pearson Correlation calculation. We show that nuke attacks using a multiple-target approach can be configured to be effective against item-based recommenders. To evaluate the effectiveness of these attacks, we use new and existing robustness metrics and an experimental design that includes a variety of attack models, attack sizes, target item types, number of target items, and datasets.

Finally, experiments on three benchmark datasets (Corel-5k, ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12) for image annotation are performed, and the results show that our approach is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={Affective computing (AC) is a new field of emotion research along with the development of computing technology and human-machine interaction technology. Emotion recognition is a crucial part of the AC research framework. Emotion recognition based on physiological signals provides richer information without deception than other techniques such as facial expression, tone of voice, and gestures. Many studies of emotion recognition have been conducted, but the classification accuracy is diverse due to variability in stimuli, emotion categories, devices, feature extraction and machine learning algorithms. This paper reviews all works that cited DEAP dataset (a public available dataset which uses music video to induce emotion and record EEG and peripheral physiological signals) and introduces detailed methods and algorithms on feature extraction, normalization, dimension reduction, emotion classification, and cross validation. Eventually, this work presents the application of AC on game development, multimedia production, interactive experience, and social network as well as the current limitations and the direction of future investigation. © 2016, Science Press.

abstract={A total of five highly related strains of an unidentified marine bacterium were analyzed through their short genome sequences (AM260709-AM260713). Genome-to-Genome Distance (GGDC) showed high similarity to Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis (X67024). The generated unique Quick Response (QR) codes indicated no identity to other microbial species or gene sequences. Chaos Game Representation (CGR) showed the number of bases concentrated in the area. Guanine residues were highest in number followed by cytosine. Frequency of Chaos Game Representation (FCGR) indicated that CC and GG blocks have higher frequency in the sequence from the evaluated marine bacterium strains. Maximum GC content for the marine bacterium strains ranged 53-54%. The use of QR codes, CGR, FCGR, and GC dataset helped in identifying and interpreting short genome sequences from specific isolates. A phylogenetic tree was constructed with the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) using MEGA6 software. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out using EMBL-EBI MUSCLE program. Thus, generated genomic data are of great assistance for hierarchical classification in Bacterial Systematics which combined with phenotypic features represents a basic procedure for a polyphasic approach on unambiguous bacterial isolate taxonomic classification. © 2016 Bhagwan N.

abstract={In this paper, we study the challenging problem of predicting the dynamics of objects in static images. Given a query object in an image, our goal is to provide a physical understanding of the object in terms of the forces acting upon it and its long term motion as response to those forces. Direct and explicit estimation of the forces and the motion of objects from a single image is extremely challenging. We define intermediate physical abstractions called Newtonian scenarios and introduce Newtonian Neural Network (N3) that learns to map a single image to a state in a Newtonian scenario. Our evaluations show that our method can reliably predict dynamics of a query object from a single image. In addition, our approach can provide physical reasoning that supports the predicted dynamics in terms of velocity and force vectors. To spur research in this direction we compiled Visual Newtonian Dynamics (VIND) dataset that includes more than 6000 videos aligned with Newtonian scenarios represented using game engines, and more than 4500 still images with their ground truth dynamics.},

Facial expressions play crucial role in social interactions and commonly used in the behavioral interpretation of emotions. Automatic facial expression recognition is one of the interesting and challenging problem in computer vision due to its potential applications such as Human Computer Interaction(HCI), behavioral science, video games etc. In this paper, a novel method for automatically recognizing facial expressions using Deep Convolutional Neural Network(DCNN) features is proposed. The proposed model focuses on recognizing the facial expressions of an individual from a single image. The feature extraction time is significantly reduced due to the usage of general purpose graphic processing unit (GPGPU).

abstract={One of the major reasons why people find music so enjoyable is its emotional impact. Creating emotion-based playlists is a natural way of organizing music. The usability of online music streaming services could be greatly improved by developing emotion-based access methods, and automatic music emotion recognition (MER) is the most quick and feasible way of achieving it. When resorting to music for emotional regulation purposes, users are interested in the MER method to predict their induced, or felt emotion. The progress of MER in this area is impeded by the absence of publicly accessible ground-truth data on musically induced emotion. Also, there is no consensus on the question which emotional model best fits the demands of the users and can provide an unambiguous linguistic framework to describe musical emotions. In this paper we address these problems by creating a sizeable publicly available dataset of 400 musical excerpts from four genres annotated with induced emotion. We collected the data using an online "game with a purpose" Emotify, which attracted a big and varied sample of participants. We employed a nine item domain-specific emotional model GEMS (Geneva Emotional Music Scale). In this paper we analyze the collected data and report agreement of participants on different categories of GEMS. We also analyze influence of extra-musical factors on induced emotion (gender, mood, music preferences). We suggest that modifications in GEMS model are necessary. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The role of mentoring for women in sports industry has gathered attention among researchers in the past years (Bower, 2009; Bower, & Hums 2009, 2014; Weaver, & Chelladurai, 1999, 2002). Since few women are in leadership positions (Acosta, & Carpenter, 2014), cross-gender mentoring relationships are more likely to happen (Hopkins et al., 2008). However, according to Kram (1985), cross-gender mentoring relationships are more complex in terms of individual development and quality of the developmental relationship. In particular, role modeling function is limited (Kram, 1985). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine the functions of the same gender mentoring relationships looking at coach Pat Summitt, the winningest coach in NCAA Division I basketball history and a woman in leadership position (Becker & Wrisberg, 2008). Due to the exploratory nature of the study and the huge impact of Pat Summitt on sport (Janssen, & Dale, 2002, De Marco, & Mccullick, 1997), a single case study design to analyze her relationships from the staff and players' perspectives was utilized as the method for data collection. This study collected data published on American news sites located using Internet search engines Google News (http://www.google. com) for 7 days. The dataset included content published through national and regional online news media, radio, television and entertainment websites and blogs. Texts were qualitatively reviewed with a content analysis and coded (Patton, 2002). This study identified career and psychosocial functions that were important in developing an effective mentoring relationships. In particular, the psychosocial functions of "role modeling" was identified as the most important for the relationship. In fact a female mentor as a role model can be perceived as a woman that has successfully overcome discriminatory barriers to career advancement.},

abstract={Purpose: To test whether or not digital full-arch implant impressions with two different intra-oral scanners (CEREC Omnicam and True Definition) have the same accuracy as conventional ones. The hypothesis was that the splinted open-tray impressions would be more accurate than digital full-arch impressions. Material and methods: A stone master cast representing an edentulous mandible using five internal connection implant analogs (Straumann Bone Level RC, Basel, Switzerland) was fabricated. The three median implants were parallel to each other, the far left implant had 10°, and the far right had 15° distal angulation. A splinted open-tray technique was used for the conventional polyether impressions (n = 10) for Group 1. Digital impressions (n = 10) were taken with two intra-oral optical scanners (CEREC Omnicam and 3M True Definition) after connecting polymer scan bodies to the master cast for groups 2 and 3. Master cast and conventional impression test casts were digitized with a high-resolution reference scanner (Activity 880 scanner; Smart Optics, Bochum, Germany) to obtain digital files. Standard tessellation language (STL) datasets from the three test groups of digital and conventional impressions were superimposed with the STL dataset from the master cast to assess the 3D deviations. Deviations were recorded as root-mean-square error. To compare the master cast with conventional and digital impressions at the implant level, Welch's F-test was used together with Games-Howell post hoc test. Results: Group I had a mean value of 167.93 μm (SD 50.37); Group II (Omnicam) had a mean value of 46.41 μm (SD 7.34); Group III (True Definition) had a mean value of 19.32 μm (SD 2.77). Welch's F-test was used together with the Games-Howell test for post hoc comparisons. Welch's F-test showed a significant difference between the groups (P < 0.001). The Games-Howell test showed statistically significant 3D deviations for all three groups (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Full-arch digital implant impressions using True Definition scanner and Omnicam were significantly more accurate than the conventional impressions with the splinted open-tray technique. Additionally, the digital impressions with the True Definition scanner had significantly less 3D deviations when compared with the Omnicam. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.},

abstract={This work is motivated by the interest in feature selection that greatly affects the detection accuracy of a classifier. The goals of this paper are (i) identifying optimal feature subset using a novel wrapper based feature selection algorithm called Shapley Value Embedded Genetic Algorithm (SVEGA), (ii) showing the improvement in the detection accuracy of the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifier with the optimal features selected, (iii) evaluating the performance of proposed SVEGA-ANN model on the medical datasets. The medical diagnosis system has been built using a wrapper based feature selection algorithm that attempts to maximize the specificity and sensitivity (in turn the accuracy) as well as by employing an ANN for classification. Two memetic operators namely "include" and "remove" features (or genes) are introduced to realize the genetic algorithm (GA) solution. The use of GA for feature selection facilitates quick improvement in the solution through a fine tune search. An extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed SVEGA-ANN method on 26 benchmark datasets from UCI Machine Learning repository and Kent ridge repository, with three conventional classifiers, outperforms state-of-the-art systems in terms of classification accuracy, number of selected features and running time. © 2016 CTU FTS.},

abstract={We present an end-to-end learning method for chess, relying on deep neural networks. Without any a priori knowledge, in particular without any knowledge regarding the rules of chess, a deep neural network is trained using a combination of unsupervised pretraining and supervised training. The unsupervised training extracts high level features from a given position, and the supervised training learns to compare two chess positions and select the more favorable one. The training relies entirely on datasets of several million chess games, and no further domain specific knowledge is incorporated. The experiments show that the resulting neural network (referred to as DeepChess) is on a par with state-of-the-art chess playing programs, which have been developed through many years of manual feature selection and tuning. DeepChess is the first end-to-end machine learningbased method that results in a grandmaster-level chess playing performance. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Entrepreneurs in emerging market economies operate in weak institutional contexts, which can imply different types of government. In some countries (e.g., Russia), the government is predatory, and the main risk faced by (successful) entrepreneurs relates to expropriation. In other countries (like China) this kind of risk is lower; nevertheless the government is intrusive, and the rules of the game remain fluid. The implication of the latter for entrepreneurs is that they are more likely to spend time and resources on influence (rent seeking) activities rather than on productive activities. We illustrate this type of government by focusing on the distribution of subsidies in China. We present a simple formal model that explores not only the direct effects of rent seeking for a company but also externalities under a situation of policy-generated uncertainty in the distribution of subsidies. We explore how these effects differ for the entrepreneurial sector (young, private and small companies) compared with other sectors. We posit that while the performance of private companies is more affected than the performance of state firms, the impact of government-induced uncertainty on young and small companies is actually less pronounced. Our empirical analysis, based on a unique large dataset of 2.4 million observations on Chinese companies, takes advantage of the regional and sectoral heterogeneity of China for empirical tests. © 2015 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={Sponsored search auctions (SSAs) have attracted a lot of research attention in recent years and different equilibrium concepts have been studied in order to understand advertisers' bidding strategies. However, the assumption that advertisers are perfectly rational in these studies is unrealistic in the real world. In this work, we apply the quantal response equilibrium (QRE), which is powerful in modeling bounded rationality, to SSAs. Due to high computational complexity, existing methods for QRE computation have very poor scalability for SSAs. Through exploiting the structures of QRE for SSAs, this paper presents an efficient homotopy-based algorithm to compute the QRE for large-size SSAs, which features the following two novelties: 1) we represent the SSAs as an Action Graph Game (AGG) which can compute the expected utilities in polynomial time; 2) we further significantly reduce redundant calculations by leveraging the underlying relations between advertisers' utilities. We also develop an estimator to infer parameters of SSAs and fit the QRE model into a dataset from a commercial search engine. Our experimental results indicate that the algorithm can significantly improve the scalability of QRE computation for SSAs and the QRE model can describe the real-world bidding behaviors in a very accurate manner. © 2016 The Authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={The design of the best economic mechanism for Sponsored Search Auctions (SSAs) is a central task in computational mechanism design/game theory. Two open questions concern (i) the adoption of user models more accurate than the currently used one and (ii) the choice between Generalized Second Price auction (GSP) and Vickrey-Clark-Groves mechanism (VCG). In this paper, we provide some contributions to answer these questions. We study Price of Anarchy (PoA) and Price of Stability (PoS) over social welfare and auctioneer's revenue of GSP w.r.t. the VCG when the users follow the famous cascade model. Furthermore, we provide exact, randomized, and approximate algorithms, showing that in real-world settings (Yahoo Webscope A3 dataset, 10 available slots) optimal allocations can be found in less than 1s with up to 1,000 ads, and can be approximated in less than 20ms even with more than 1,000 ads with an average accuracy greater than 99%. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={We propose the contextual combinatorial cascading bandits, a combinatorial online learning game, where at each time step a learning agent is given a set of contextual information, then selects a list of items, and observes stochastic outcomes of a prefix in the selected items by some stopping criterion. In online recommendation, the stopping criterion might be the first item a user selects; in network routing, the stopping criterion might be the first edge blocked in a path. We consider position discounts in the list order, so that the agent's reward is discounted depending on the position where the stopping criterion is met. We design a UCB-type algorithm, C3-UCB, for this problem, prove an n-step regret bound Õ(√n) in the general setting, and give finer analysis for two special cases. Our work generalizes existing studies in several directions, including contextual information, position discounts, and a more general cascading bandit model. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the advantage of involving contextual information and position discounts.},

abstract={Product reviews are now widely used by individuals for making their decisions. However, due to the purpose of profit, reviewers game the system by posting fake reviews for promoting or demoting the target products. In the past few years, fake review detection has attracted significant attention from both the industrial organizations and academic communities. However, the issue remains to be a challenging problem due to lacking of labelling materials for supervised learning and evaluation. Current works made many attempts to address this problem from the angles of reviewer and review. However, there has been little discussion about the product related review features which is the main focus of our method. This paper proposes a novel convolutional neural network model to integrate the product related review features through a product word composition model. To reduce overfitting and high variance, a bagging model is introduced to bag the neural network model with two efficient classifiers. Experiments on the real-life Amazon review dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2016 Chengai Sun et al.},

abstract={E-commerce develops rapidly. Learning and taking good advantage of the myriad reviews from online customers has become crucial to the success in this game, which calls for increasingly more accuracy in sentiment classification of these reviews. Therefore the finer-grained review rating prediction is preferred over the rough binary sentiment classification. There are mainly two types of method in current review rating prediction. One includes methods based on review text content which focus almost exclusively on textual content and seldom relate to those reviewers and items remarked in other relevant reviews. The other one contains methods based on collaborative filtering which extract information from previous records in the reviewer-item rating matrix, however, ignoring review textual content. Here we proposed a framework for review rating prediction which shows the effective combination of the two. Then we further proposed three specific methods under this framework. Experiments on two movie review datasets demonstrate that our review rating prediction framework has better performance than those previous methods. © 2016 Bingkun Wang et al.},

abstract={A novel mobile healthcare solution for remotely monitoring neuro-cognitive efficiency is here presented. The method is based on the spatio-temporal characterization of a specific Event-Related Potential (ERP), called P300, induced in our brain by a target stimulus. P300 analysis is used as a biomarker: the amplitude and latency of the signal are quality indexes of the brain activity. Up to now the P300 characterization has been performed in hospital through EEG analysis and it has not been experimented an algorithm that can work remotely and learn from the subject performance. The proposed m-health service allows remote EEG monitoring of P300 through a 'plug and play' system based on the video game reaction of the subject under test. The signal processing is achieved by tuned Residue Iteration Decomposition (t-RIDE). The methodology has been tested on the parietal-cortex area (Pz, Fz, Cz) of 12 subjects involved in three different cognitive tasks with increasing difficulty. For the set of considered subjects, a P300 deviation has been detected: the amplitude ranges around 2.8μV - 8μV and latency around 300ms-410ms. To demonstrate the improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm respect the state of the art, a comparison between t-RIDE, RIDE, Independent component analysis (ICA) approaches and grand average method is here reported. t-RIDE and ICA analysis report the same results (0.1% deviation) using the same dataset (game with a detection of 40 targets). Nevertheless, t-RIDE is 1.6 times faster than ICA since converges in 79 iterations (i.e. t-RIDE: 1.95s against ICA: 3.1s). Furthermore, t-RIDE reaches 80% of accuracy after only 13 targets (task time can be reduced to 65s); differently from ICA, t-RIDE can be performed even on a single channel. The procedure shows fast diagnosis capability in cognitive deficit, including mild and heavy cognitive impairment. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The present study describes the development of a neurocognitive paradigm: "Assessing Neurocognition via Gamified Experimental Logic" (ANGEL), for performing the parametric evaluation of multiple neurocognitive functions simultaneously. ANGEL employs an audiovisual sensory motor design for the acquisition of multiple event related potentials (ERPs)-the C1, P50, MMN, N1, N170, P2, N2pc, LRP, P300, and ERN. The ANGEL paradigm allows assessment of 10 neurocognitive variables over the course of three "game" levels of increasing complexity ranging from simple passive observation to complex discrimination and response in the presence of multiple distractors. The paradigm allows assessment of several levels of rapid decision making: speeded up response vs. response-inhibition; responses to easy vs. difficult tasks; responses based on gestalt perception of clear vs. ambiguous stimuli; and finally, responses with set shifting during challenging tasks. The paradigm has been tested using 18 healthy participants from both sexes and the possibilities of varied data analyses have been presented in this paper. The ANGEL approach provides an ecologically valid assessment (as compared to existing tools) that quickly yields a very rich dataset and helps to assess multiple ERPs that can be studied extensively to assess cognitive functions in health and disease conditions. © 2016 Nair, Sasidharan, John, Mehrotra and Kutty.},

abstract={We describe a method of achieving emotion classification using ECG and EDA data. There have been many studies conducted on usage of heart rate and EDA data to quantify the arousal level of a user [1–3]. Researchers have identified a connection between a person’s ECG data and the positivity or negativity of their emotional state [4]. The goal of this work is to extend this idea to human computer interaction domain. We will explore whether the valence/arousal level of a subject’s response to computer based stimuli is predictable using ECG and EDA, and whether or not that information can complement recordings of participants’ cognitive data to form a more accurate depiction of emotional state. The experiment consists of presenting three types of stimuli, both interactive and noninteractive, to 9 subjects and recording their physiological response via ECG and EDA data as well as fNIRS device. The stimuli were selected from validated methods of inducing emotion including DEAP dataset [5], Multi Attribute Task Battery [6] and Tetris video game [7]. The participants’ responses were captured using Self-Assessment Manikin [8] surveys which were used as the ground truth labels. The resulting data was analyzed using Machine Learning. The results provide new avenues of research in combining physiological data to classify emotion. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Short sprints are important components of most wheelchair court sports, since being faster than the opponent often determines keeping ball possession or not. Sprinting capacity is best measured during a field test, allowing the athlete to freely choose push strategies adapted to their own wheelchair setting, physical ability, classification and speed changes during a sprint. The key test outcome is sprint duration, but there are various ways to accomplish the same sprint time. So can different push strategies be identified in a wheelchair sport and how do they relate to athlete level/classification and wheelchair configuration? These relationships were investigated by field tests of 30 male wheelchair basketball athletes during a 12 meter sprint in their own wheelchair. A recently developed method for ambulatory measurement was used to calculate wheelchair kinematics [1], providing outcomes on displacement, speed, acceleration and pushes. Additionally maximal isometric push force was recorded and rear seat height was noted. Within the measured athletes, internationals were expected to be faster due to a better physical training status and technique, allowing them to sprint with fewer (but more powerful) pushes. Likewise, athletes of higher classification were expected to be faster due their superior physical capacity, but the effect on the number of pushes used was not that evident. Video analysis was added to validate push detection of the ambulatory measurement system. Mutual correlations and competition level differences of sprint characteristics were calculated. General Linear Models (GLM) were drawn to determine the effect of competition level and classification on sprint time and number of pushes. In the overall dataset sprint characteristics did not correlate significantly with classification, but if split by competition level, there were significant correlations with sprint time (r=-0.715, p=0.006) and number of pushes (r=-0.647, p= 0.017) in the national level athletes. Sprint time, number of pushes and isometric push force differed significantly between national and international level wheelchair basketball athletes. Competition level showed to be a significant (p<0.05) factor in univariate GLMs for sprint time and number of pushes, whereas classification did not. The interaction of competition level and classification as a factor in univariate GLMs was significant. As hypothesized, international level athletes were faster with fewer pushes, even though their higher average seat height was less optimal for propulsion [2]. The interaction effect of competition level and classification in the GLM indicates that the effect of classification on sprint time and number of pushes is different between competition levels. Indeed, in the national level athletes there was a clear relationship between classification and sprint time / number of pushes, but not in internationals. This difference is pointing at a more professional level of wheelchair configuration or better technique of the international athletes regarding sprint performance. Given the correlation between seat height and classification, the seat height of lowly classified athletes seemed optimized for sprinting, whereas seat height of highly classified athletes with already adequate sprinting capacity was optimized for upward reach. Future research based on larger groups with more even distribution over classifications could provide more solid models and reveal more detailed insight in push strategy efficacy. Given the proven reliability of the inertial sensor based method [1] and the proven reliability for push detection in sprinting, this research could well be performed using this easy to use ambulatory method. Although more challenging than well controlled experimental research, the field based setting in this research revealed additional information not only describing the relation between wheelchair setting and performance, but also describing its practical applications if other game demands were taken into account. The results of this approach is believed to assist athletes, coaches and wheelchair experts in decision making concerning wheelchair configuration and athlete training. © 2016 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Nuclear receptors (NRs) form a large family of ligand-inducible transcription factors that regulate gene expressions involved in numerous physiological phenomena, such as embryogenesis, homeostasis, cell growth and death. These nuclear receptors-related pathways are important targets of marketed drugs. Therefore, the design of a reliable computational model for predicting NRs from amino acid sequence has now been a significant biomedical problem. Results: Conjoint triad feature (CTF) mainly considers neighbor relationships in protein sequences by encoding each protein sequence using the triad (continuous three amino acids) frequency distribution extracted from a 7-letter reduced alphabet. In addition, chaos game representation (CGR) can investigate the patterns hidden in protein sequences and visually reveal previously unknown structure. In this paper, three methods, CTF, CGR, amino acid composition (AAC), are applied to formulate the protein samples. By considering different combinations of three methods, we study seven groups of features, and each group is evaluated by the 10-fold cross-validation test. Meanwhile, a new non-redundant dataset containing 474 NR sequences and 500 non-NR sequences is built based on the latest NucleaRDB database. Comparing the results of numerical experiments, the group of combined features with CTF and AAC gets the best result with the accuracy of 96.30% for identifying NRs from non-NRs. Moreover, if it is classified as a NR, it will be further put into the second level, which will classify a NR into one of the eight main subfamilies. At the second level, the group of combined features with CTF and AAC also gets the best accuracy of 94.73%. Subsequently, the proposed predictor is compared with two existing methods, and the comparisons show that the accuracies of two levels significantly increase to 98.79% (NR-2L: 92.56%; iNR-PhysChem: 98.18%; the first level) and 93.71% (NR-2L: 88.68%; iNR-PhysChem: 92.45%; the second level) with the introduction of our CTF-based method. Finally, each component of CTF features is analyzed via the statistical significant test, and a simplified model only with the resulting top-50 significant features achieves accuracy of 95.28%. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate that our CTF-based method is an effective way for predicting nuclear receptor proteins. Furthermore, the top-50 significant features obtained from the statistical significant test are considered as the "intrinsic features" in predicting NRs based on the analysis of relative importance. © 2015 Wang and Hu.},

With this as our guiding principle, we collected the Tower Game Dataset consisting of multimodal recordings of two players participating in a tower building game, in the process communicating and collaborating with each other. The format of the game was specifically chosen as it elicits spontaneous communication from the participants through social interaction predicates such as joint attention and entrainment.

abstract={In the context of social media services, data shortage has severally hindered accurate user modeling and practical personalized applications. This paper is motivated to leverage the user data distributed in disparate online social networks (OSN) to make up for the data shortage in user modeling, which we refer to as 'cross-OSN user modeling.' Generally, the data that the same user distributes in different OSNs consist of both behavior data (i.e., interaction with multimedia items) and social data (i.e., interaction between users). This paper focuses on the following two challenges: 1) how to aggregate the users' cross-OSN interactions with multimedia items of the same modality, which we call cross-OSN homogeneous behaviors, and 2) how to integrate users' cross-OSN social data with behavior data. Our proposed solution to address the challenges consist of two corresponding components as follows. 1) Homogeneous behavior quantification, where homogeneous user behaviors are quantified based on their importance in reflecting user preferences. After quantification, the examined cross-OSN user behaviors are aggregated to construct a unified user-item interaction matrix. 2) Local social regularization, where the cross-OSN social data is integrated as regularization in matrix factorization-based user modeling at local topic level. The proposed cross-OSN user modeling solution is evaluated in the application of personalized video recommendation. Carefully designed experiments on self-collected Google+ and YouTube datasets have validated its effectiveness and the advantage over single-OSN-based methods. © 1999-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The feature selection phase in network attack detection is mostly classifier based, while clustering techniques are used for labeling and creating compact training datasets. Because clustering finds natural groupings in the data, in this paper, a clustering-based layered wrapper feature selection approach, LAWRA, has been proposed for selecting appropriate features for attack detection. The existing layered feature selection approaches in attack detection are unable to give results with high precision and recall because of the dependence on classifier accuracy, fitness value, and so on. Hence, in this paper, LAWRA uses external cluster validity indices, F-measure, and Fowlkes-Mallows index, for feature selection. The two indices are the harmonic and geometric mean of precision and recall, respectively. Each index identifies features that give high precision and high recall of the attack detection algorithm. The first layer of LAWRA identifies the feature subset that best distinguishes between normal and attack instances and the second layer identifies the best cooperating features using cooperative game theory. Experiments have been conducted on NSL-KDD dataset, and LAWRA has been compared with the existing approaches using different classifiers. The results show that LAWRA gives better overall accuracy and F-measure value than the other approaches. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Due to the limited resources such as bandwidth, buffer, energy, and so on, most delay tolerant networks (DTNs) nodes are selfish and do not forward messages for other nodes to save their precious resources, which seriously degrades the routing performance. To stimulate the DTNs selfish nodes to cooperatively forward messages and reduce the message delivery delay, this paper proposes a virtual currency-based incentive-aware low delay routing algorithm, called VCILDR. A delay-based currency payment and allocation strategy is established to encourage selfish nodes to forward messages for other nodes in VCILDR. In this way, the direct beneficial messages are forwarded to the nodes with lower delivery delay and mutually beneficial messages are exchanged at the same time. A bargaining game model of alternating offers is established to determine the exchanged mutually beneficial messages. In addition, a greedy algorithm for solving the model's subgame perfect equilibrium is proposed in this paper. Extensive simulations are carried out on real-world dataset to verify the performance of this incentive-aware low delay routing. The experimental results show that the proposed routing can effectively stimulate DTNs selfish nodes to cooperatively forward messages for others, reduce the message delivery delay and improve the message delivery success ratio at the same time. © 2015, Science Press.

abstract={Objective To determine whether the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games were associated with a change in the number of patients attending or diagnosed with a new sexually transmitted infection (STI) at sexual health clinics in London and Weymouth. Methods We undertook an interrupted time-series analysis of surveillance data from the Genitourinary Medicine Clinic Activity Dataset (GUMCAD) collected at 33 genitourinary medicine (GUM) clinics in London and Weymouth (where Games events were concentrated) between 2009 and 2012. Mixed-effects linear regression models of weekly attendance and diagnoses, incorporating temporal trends, bank holidays, categorical month and clinic closures, were used to test for the effect of the 'Olympic-Paralympic' period. We subdivided the 9-week 'Olympic-Paralympic' period (16 July 2012 to 17 September 2012) into five periods, including three Olympic weeks, two Paralympic weeks, pre-, post- and inter-Games weeks. We also compared characteristics of patients attending during the Olympic-Paralympic period and those attending during the same period in 2011. Results During the 3 weeks of the Olympics, there was a significant reduction in the number of new episode attendances (2020 fewer, 5.6% reduction (95% CI -8.2 to -2.9)) and the number of patients diagnosed with an STI (267 fewer, 4.8% reduction (95% CI -8.6 to -0.9)) compared to expected. There were no important differences in the profile of patients attending during the 2012 Olympic-Paralympic period and those attending during the same period in 2011. Conclusions We conclude that a 'business-as-usual' approach to managing local sexual health clinics during the 2012 Olympic and Paralympics would have been appropriate.},

abstract={This paper proposes a hybrid solar radiation forecasting method based on a novel game theoretic self-organizing map (GTSOM). New strategies are proposed to resolve the limitations of the original SOM for non-winning neurons and increase their competition with winning neurons to obtain more input patterns. Neural gas (NG) and competitive Hebbian Learning (CHL) are used to enhance the learning and quality of the map. Solar radiation data are decomposed by the discrete wavelet transform (DWT). A time series analysis is then used to develop the structure of the training and testing for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). The proposed GTSOM groups the time-series analyzed datasets into clusters with similar data. The elbow method is used to determine the number of clusters. A cluster selection method is developed to determine the appropriate cluster whose solar radiation data provide the input to the NN. Temperature, wind speed and wind direction data are also included in the inputs to the BNN whose outputs provide the solar radiation forecasts. The historical solar radiation data are used to evaluate the accuracy of the hybrid forecasting with the proposed clustering and its comparison with that of the K-means, the original SOM and NG clustering algorithms. The comparison demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed clustering method. © 2015.},

abstract={Increased recognition of potential future climate changes has sparked an urgency in understanding the various linkages among weather, climate and sectors of society. Furthermore, the need for improving climate models is also paramount. Meteorological observations are critical for accomplishing both. A deeper knowledge of the origin, nuances and availability of observation-based climate data can lead to better analyses and validations. In this article, we review the suite of current meteorological observing networks across the continental U.S. In addition, we discuss both the statistical procedures that are used to construct climate data products from observing records, and the climate data products themselves. The focus here is on datasets with daily to hourly time steps, with an emphasis on gridded climate data products of spatial resolutions under 15km. Ultimately, this paper is geared towards climatologists as well as those outside of the climate field, who need data to empower near-surface atmospheric science research at the local scale. Presently, new observing networks supported by massive volunteer communities are potential game changers, yet the public still lacks both daily precipitation data suitable for high-resolution and/or long-term analyses and rigorous validation of high-resolution gridded climate data products. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Mahseer (Tor spp.) are flagship fishes in South Asian rivers. Their populations are threatened through poaching and habitat disturbance, yet they are highly prized game fishes due to their large size, appearance and sporting qualities. The international recreational angling community has frequently been cited as playing a vital role in conserving these fishes while also providing economic benefit to poor rural communities. Owing to a lack of scientific data and the considerable challenges associated with monitoring fish populations in large monsoonal rivers, efforts to determine the long-term trends in their populations has focused on sport-fishing catch records. Here, catch data collected between 1998 and 2012 from Galibore, a former fishing camp on the River Cauvery, Karnataka, India, were analysed to determine the catch per unit effort (CPUE - by number and weight) as an indicator of relative fish abundance, along with the size structure of catches. This fishery operated a mandatory catch-and-release (C&R) policy, and provided the fish community with protection from illegal fishing. Between 1998 and 2012, 23 620hours fishing effort were applied to catch and release 6161 mahseer, ranging in size from 1 to 104 lbs (0.45-46.8kg) in weight. Across the period, CPUE in number increased significantly over time with a concomitant decrease in CPUE by weight, revealing strong recruitment in the population and a shift in population size structure. This suggests a strong response to the C&R policy and the reduction in illegal fishing, indicating that conservation strategies focusing on the beneficial and negative aspects of exploitation can be successful in achieving positive outcomes. These outputs from angler catch data provide insights into the mahseer population that were impossible to collect by any alternative method. They provide the most comprehensive analysis of a long-term dataset specific to any of the mahseer species across their entire geographical range and demonstrate the value of organised angling as a conservation monitoring tool to enhance biological data, and inform conservation and fishery management actions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper, we address the challenges of automatic tracking, detection and recognition of three-dimensional human pose-based actions from sequences of depth maps. Specifically, we have designed our proposed idea into a probabilistic framework: 1) dividing each action into meaningful ordered temporal segments, 2) using pixel-neighboring intensity difference approach to identify human shape region from the confused scenes, 3) introducing a robust spatiotemporal features to extract 3D joints information via local distance features and depth human shape information to get motion variation features and 4) finally these sets of features are merged together and their feature vectors are further reduced and discriminated to get optimal vectors for real-world applications. Next, the augmented features are enhanced and symbolized by Linde-Buzo-Gray clustering algorithm for better action recognition. With these symbols, each action hidden Markov model (HMM) is trained and tested for action recognition. The experimental results demonstrated our proposed approach on three challenging depth video datasets: IM-DepthActions, MSRAction3D and MSRDailyActivity3D, producing significantly improved results over the state-of-the-art methods: especially for those actions that are not easily discernible by the existing methods. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The hand is an important part of the body used to express information through gestures, and its movements can be used in dynamic gesture recognition systems based on computer vision with practical applications, such as medical, games and sign language. Although depth sensors have led to great progress in gesture recognition, hand gesture recognition still is an open problem because of its complexity, which is due to the large number of small articulations in a hand. This paper proposes a novel approach for hand gesture recognition with depth maps generated by the Microsoft Kinect Sensor (Microsoft, Redmond, WA, USA) using a variation of the CIPBR (convex invariant position based on RANSAC) algorithm and a hybrid classifier composed of dynamic time warping (DTW) and Hidden Markov models (HMM), called the hybrid approach for gesture recognition with depth maps (HAGR-D). The experiments show that the proposed model overcomes other algorithms presented in the literature in hand gesture recognition tasks, achieving a classification rate of 97.49% in the MSRGesture3D dataset and 98.43% in the RPPDI dynamic gesture dataset. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The feature selection algorithms associated with non-linear kernel based Support Vector Machines (SVM) are either NP-hard or greedy and hence, not very optimal. To deal with this problem, a metric based on the principles of coalition game theory called Shapely value and a sampling approximation is used to determine the contributions of individual features towards the classification task. Feature subsets are randomly drawn from a probability distribution function generated using normalized Shapely values of the individual features. These feature subsets are then used to build kernels corresponding to individual weak classifiers in the Sparse Kernel-based Ensemble Learning (SKEL) framework. By weighting the kernels optimally and sparsely, a small number of useful subsets of features are selected which improve the generalization performance of the ensemble classifier. The algorithm is applied on real hyper-spectral datasets and the results are presented in the paper. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The problem of identifying interacting genes that jointly are associated with a phenotype is considered. When the number of features are extremely large compared to the number of samples, there may be several subsets of features that provide acceptable levels of predictability. This is particularly true in cancer genomics, where we are interested in finding functionally related gene sets likely to jointly drive cancer phenotypes. In this paper, a novel game theoretic solution is proposed by modeling genes as players of a Coalition Game. This method discovers and develops informative gene subnetworks by integrating gene expression profiling of cancer tissues with protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. These subnetworks are gradually developed by selective addition of candidate genes that present maximal Shapely values in coalition with subnetworks of genes. We applied the proposed algorithm to an ovarian cancer dataset (N = 201), in order to identify optimal subnetworks that can predict cancer progression risk in response to platinum-based therapy. We show improved predictive power of the proposed method when compared to state-of-the-art feature selection methods, with the added advantage of identifying potentially functional gene subnetworks that may provide insights into the mechanisms underlying cancer progression. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The United States pediatric vaccine market is examined using Bertrand-Edgeworth-Chamberlin price competition. The proposed game captures interactions between symmetric, capacity-constrained manufacturers in a differentiated, single-product market with linear demand. Results indicate that a unique pure strategy equilibrium exists in the case where the capacities of the manufacturers are at their extreme. For the capacity region where no pure strategy equilibrium exists, there exists a mixed strategy equilibrium where the distribution function, its support, and the expected profit of the manufacturers are characterized. Three game instances are introduced to model the United States pediatric vaccine market. In each instance, the manufacturers are assumed to have equal capacity in producing vaccines. Vaccines are differentiated based upon the number of reported adverse medical events for that vaccine. Using a game-theoretic model, equilibrium prices are computed for each monovalent vaccine. Results indicate that the equilibrium prices for monovalent vaccines are lower than the federal contract prices. The numerical results provide both a lower and upper bound for the vaccine equilibrium prices in the public sector, based on the capacity of the vaccine manufacturers. Results illustrate the importance of several model parameters such as market demand and vaccine adverse events on the equilibrium prices. Supplementary materials are available for this article.

abstract={The proper functioning of the mesolimbic reward system is largely dependent on the neurotransmitter dopamine. Recent evidence suggests that the hypocretin system has significant projections to this reward system. We examined the distinct effects of reduced dopamine or reduced hypocretin levels on reward activity in patients with Parkinson's disease, dopamine deficient, as well as patients with narcolepsy-cataplexy, hypocretin depleted, and healthy controls. Participants performed a simple game-like task while high-density electroencephalography was recorded. Topography and timing of event-related potentials for both reward cue, and reward feedback was examined across the entire dataset. While response to reward cue was similar in all groups, two distinct time points were found to distinguish patients and controls for reward feedback. Around 160ms both patient groups had reduced ERP amplitude compared to controls. Later at 250ms, both patient groups also showed a clear event-related potential (ERP), which was absent in controls. The initial differences show that both patient groups show a similar, blunted response to reward delivery. The second potential corresponds to the classic feedback-related negativity (FRN) potential which relies on dopamine activity and reflects reward prediction-error signaling. In particular the mismatch between predicted reward and reward subsequently received was significantly higher in PD compared to NC, independent of reward magnitude and valence. The intermediate FRN response in NC highlights the contribution of hypocretin in reward processing, yet also shows that this is not as detrimental to the reward system as in Parkinson's. Furthermore, the inability to generate accurate predictions in NC may explain why hypocretin deficiency mediates cataplexy triggered by both positive and negative emotions. © 2015 Mensen et al.

abstract={In social media, users have contributed enormous behavior data online which can be leveraged for user modeling and conduct personalized services. Temporal user modeling, which incorporates the timestamp of these behavior data and understands users' interest evolution, have attracted attention recently. With the recognition that user interests are vulnerable to transient events, many current temporal user modeling solutions propose to first identify the transient events and then consider the identified events into user behavior modeling. In this work, in the context of microblogs, we propose a unified probabilistic framework to simultaneously model the process of transient event detection and temporal user tweeting. The outputs of the framework include: (1) one long-term topic space spanning over general categories, (2) one short-term topic space for each time interval corresponding to the transient events, and (3) users' interest distributions over the long- and short-term topic spaces. Qualitative and quantitative experimental evaluation are conducted on a large-scale Twitter dataset, with more than 2 million users and 0.3 billion tweets. The promising results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed topic models. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The popularity of Online Social Networks (OSNs) has attracted great research interests in different fields. In Economics, researchers use game theory to analyze the mechanism of network formation, which is called Network Formation Game. While in Computer Science, much effort has been done in building machine learning models to predict future or missing links. However, there are few works considering how to combine game theoretic analysis and machine learning models. Therefore, in this paper, we study the problem of Exploiting Game Theoretic Analysis for Link Recommendation in Social Networks. Our goal is to improve link recommendation accuracy via leveraging the power of Network Formation Games into machine learning models. We present two different approaches to solve this problem. First, we propose a three-phase method that straightforwardly combines game theoretic analysis with machine learning models. Second, we develop a unified model, BPRLGT, that incorporates Network Formation Game into a Bayesian ranking framework for link recommendation. Specifically, BPRLGT takes advantage of network topology and we design a game theoretic sampling approach to improve its training process. The experiments are conducted on four real world datasets and the results on all datasets demonstrate that both our proposed three-phase method and the unified ranking model outperform the baseline methods. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={The topic of crowd modeling in computer vision usually assumes a single generic typology of crowd, which is very simplistic. In this paper we adopt a taxonomy that is widely accepted in sociology, focusing on a particular category, the spectator crowd, which is formed by people 'interested in watching something specific that they came to see' [6]. This can be found at the stadiums, amphitheaters, cinema, etc. In particular, we propose a novel dataset, the Spectators Hockey (S-HOCK), which deals with 4 hockey matches during an international tournament. In the dataset, a massive annotation has been carried out, focusing on the spectators at different levels of details: at a higher level, people have been labeled depending on the team they are supporting and the fact that they know the people close to them; going to the lower levels, standard pose information has been considered (regarding the head, the body) but also fine grained actions such as hands on hips, clapping hands etc. The labeling focused on the game field also, permitting to relate what is going on in the match with the crowd behavior. This brought to more than 100 millions of annotations, useful for standard applications as people counting and head pose estimation but also for novel tasks as spectator categorization. For all of these we provide protocols and baseline results, encouraging further research. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Dance is a dynamic art form that reects a wide range of cultural diversity and individuality. With the advancement of motion-capture technology combined with crowd-sourcing and machine learning algorithms, we explore the complex relationship between perceived dance quality/dancer's gender and dance movements/music respectively. As a feasibility study, we construct a computational framework for an analysis-synthesis-feedback loop using a novel multimedia dance-music texture representation. Furthermore, we integrate crowd-sourcing, music and motion-capture data, and machine learning-based methods for dance segmentation, analysis and synthesis of new dancers. A quantitative validation of this framework on a motion-capture dataset of 172 dancers evaluated by more than 400 independent on-line raters demonstrates significant correlation between human perception and the algorithmically intended dance quality or gender of synthesized dancers. The technology illustrated in this work has a high potential to advance the multimedia entertainment industry via dancing with Turks. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Sentiment analysis has become one of the mainstream researches in social network analysis. Its impact can be seen in many practical applications, ranging from public opinion analysis to marketing of public praise and information prediction. However, most of the existing research has been performed in the sentiment classification for subjective text, the emotional evolution analysis for complex interactive text (e.g., online reviews) has not yet been thoroughly targeted by the research community. This paper is concerned on short-text Chinese online reviews collected from Tianya forum. First, an efficient affective computing framework is proposed to capture the underlying emotions of Chinese online reviews. It can accurately calculate the semantic orientation of the entire review, without requiring expensive manual labeling of seed words. As users' attitudes might influence with each other, predicting their future emotional behaviors that only relying on the emotional values of historical reviews is very one-sided. Therefore, we propose a game theory based emotional evolution prediction algorithm combining the affective computing, in which the mixed nash equilibrium strategies are calculated as the future emotional behavior of interactive users. Then, experimental results on the large-scaled review dataset are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and accurateness of our approaches. Finally, by applying the research results on the pairwise happiness-popularity coordination evaluation, we have revealed some interesting phenomenon on the "World View" board in Tianya forum. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={With the advent of game telemetry, contemporary game designers have access to a huge amount of realtime data about player behavior. However, in design practice there is a lack of effective visualization tools. Activity histograms or heatmaps can suffer from data overcrowding, making it difficult for the designer to identify patterns and outliers within a large dataset. This work-in-progress explores a new metavisualization tool for game designers that uses dendrogram representations to highlight pertinent features within large sets of heatmaps. Through interviews with professional game designers, we find that dendrograms can be used to identify outliers quickly, and are valuable in guiding designers through complex telemetry. This contributes to the ongoing work on supporting richer tools for game design practice amongst an increasingly data-filled environment. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={In both industry and academia, software tools are essential for games user research (GUR) in order to collect, integrate, analyze and report on games and players' data. GUR datasets are becoming more and more complex, detailed and multifaceted. Hence, tools are necessary to efficiently handle data. This one-day workshop explores the vast spectrum of tools used and created by current GUR researchers and provides a platform of discussion for advancing the development of such tools. This workshop will facilitate intersections from user researchers with diverse epistemologies, as well as from both academia and the industry, in an interactive Design Jam activity to collaboratively design future-proof GUR tools. The immediate outcome of the workshop is twofold: to collectively establish state-ofthe-art tool design guidelines, and to archive the papers and discussions, which will extend the conversations and relationships beyond the workshop.

abstract={Studying the network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) will provide valuable insights into the inner workings of cells. It is vitally important to develop an automated, high-throughput tool that efficiently predicts protein-protein interactions. This study proposes a new model for PPI prediction based on the concept of chaos game representation and the wavelet transform, which means that a considerable amount of sequence-order effects can be incorporated into a set of discrete numbers. The advantage of using chaos game representation and the wavelet transform to formulate the protein sequence is that it can more effectively reflect its overall sequence-order characteristics than the conventional correlation factors. Using such a formulation frame to represent the protein sequences means that the random forest algorithm can be used to conduct the prediction. The results for a large-scale independent test dataset show that the proposed model can achieve an excellent performance with an accuracy value of about 0.86 and a geometry mean value of about 0.85. The model is therefore a useful supplementary tool for PPI predictions. The predictor used in this article is freely available at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/PPI. © FUNPEC-RP.},

abstract={This work is about estimating human age automatically through analysis of facial images. It has got a lot of real-world applications. Due to prompt advances in the fields of machine vision, facial image processing, and computer graphics, automatic age estimation via faces in computer is one of the dominant topics these days. This is due to widespread real-world applications, in areas of biometrics, security, surveillance, control, forensic art, entertainment, online customer management and support, along with cosmetology. As it is difficult to estimate the exact age, this system is to estimate a certain range of ages. Four sets of classifications have been used to differentiate a person's data into one of the different age groups. The uniqueness about this study is the usage of two technologies i.e., Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Gene Expression Programing (GEP) to estimate the age and then compare the results. New methodologies like Gene Expression Programing (GEP) have been explored here and significant results were found. The dataset has been developed to provide more efficient results by superior preprocessing methods. This proposed approach has been developed, tested and trained using both the methods. A public data set was used to test the system, FG-NET. The quality of the proposed system for age estimation using facial features is shown by broad experiments on the available database of FG-NET. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Automated understanding and recognition of human activities and behaviors in a smart space (e.g., smart house) is of paramount importance to many critical human-centered applications. Recognized activities are the input to the pervasive computer (the smart space) which intelligently interacts with the users to maintain the application's goal be it assistance, safety, child-development, entertainment or other goals. Research in this area is fascinating but severely lacks adequate validation which often relies on datasets that contain sensory data representing the activities. Availing adequate datasets that can be used in a large variety of spaces, for different user groups, and aiming at different goals is very challenging. This is due to the prohibitive cost and the human capital needed to instrument physical spaces and to recruit human subjects to perform the activities and generate data. Simulation of human activities in smart spaces has therefore emerged as an alternative approach to bridge this deficit. Traditional event-driven approaches have been proposed. However, the complexity of human activity simulation was proved to be challenging to these initial simulation efforts. In this paper, we present Persim 3D-an alternative context-driven approach to simulating human activities capable of supporting complex activity scenarios. We present the context-activity-action nexus and show how our approach combines modeling and visualization of actions with context and activity simulation. We present the Persim 3D architecture and algorithms, and describe a detailed validation study of our approach to verify the accuracy and realism of the simulation output (datasets and visualizations) and the scalability of the human effort in using Persim 3D to simulate complex scenarios. We show positive and promising results that validate our approach. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Transfer Subspace Learning has gained recent popularity in the literature for its ability to perform cross-dataset and cross-domain object recognition - enablers for data fusion. The ability to leverage existing data without the need for additional data collections is attractive for Automatic Target Recognition applications. For Automatic Target Recognition (or object assessment) applications, Transfer Subspace Learning is a game changer for dynamic systems, as it enables the incorporation of sparse and dynamically collected data into existing systems that utilize large, dense databases. A baseline Transfer Subspace Learning technique is the Transfer Fisher's Linear Discriminative Analysis, an approach based on Bregman divergence-based regularization. This paper modifies the implementation of the Transfer Fisher's Linear Discriminative Analysis technique by combining it with Manifold Learning and adjusting it to allow for a more systematic search of tuning parameters. Specifically, the Diffusion Map approach is utilized, a Manifold Learning approach based on heat diffusion. The modified technique is then utilized for cross-data and cross-domain electro-optical vehicle recognition. © 2015 IEEE.},

Under the same level of punishment cost, there are more spreaders in the network that has larger average degree. Moreover, the punishment fraction has more significant impact than the risk coefficient on the controlling of rumor diffusion. There exist some optimal risk coefficients and punishment fractions that could help more people refusing to spread rumor. In addition, the effect of the tie strength on the final fraction of spreaders is investigated. The results indicate that the rumor can be suppressed soon if the individuals preferentially select the neighbor either weaker or stronger ties persistently to update their strategy. However, choosing neighbor blindly may promote the spread of rumor. Finally, by comparing three kinds of punishment mechanisms, we show that taking the lead in punishing the higher degree nodes is the most effective measure to reduce the coverage of rumor. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={In this paper we investigate the use of games technologies for the research and the development of 3D representations of real environments captured from GIS information and open source map data. Challenges involved in this area concern the large data-sets to be dealt with. Some existing map data include errors and are not complete, which makes the generation of realistic and accurate 3D environments problematic. The domain of application of our work is crisis management which requires very accurate GIS or map information. We believe the use of creating a 3D virtual environment using real map data whilst correcting and completing the missing data, improves the quality and performance of crisis management decision support system to provide a more natural and intuitive interface for crisis managers. Consequently, we present a case study into issues related to combining multiple large datasets to create an accurate representation of a novel, multi-layered, hybrid real-world maps. The hybrid map generation combines LiDAR, Ordnance Survey, and OpenStreetMap data to generate 3D cities spanning 1 km2. Evaluation of initial visualised scenes is presented. Initial tests consist of a 1 km2 landscape map containing up to 16 million vertices' and run at an optimal 51.66 frames per-second. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={The history of online video games spans over 30 years, with Mabively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPG) being one of the most popular genres. Constant evolution of MMORPGs has also brought along the need to understand how emerging game mechanisms and design choices affect the game data traffic characteristics. This paper presents a network data traffic analysis of Guild Wars 2 (GW2), an MMORPG released in 2012, with the idea to draw a comparison between GW2 and older MMORPGs, the characteristics of which are already known from previous studies, and to provide insight into the network traffic trends in this genre. For GW2 analysis, we use game data traffic collected over five weeks' time in an Internet Service Provider core network. The dataset consists of anonymized packet traces corresponding to 19 players who agreed to their network traffic being captured during gameplay. We analyze traffic characteristics, such as packet size, packet inter-Arrival times, throughput, and duration of the playing sebions, along with the participants' basic demographic information and their use of voice communication during game play. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Software developers have been recently interested in building next generation groupware systems that provide environments adaptable to various contexts of users, thus, offering information and services in a timely way depending on the developed activity. However, the existing solutions for building such systems are mostly limited to modeling and representing individual indicators, neglecting the importance of the social indicators. By contrast, in this paper we present a mechanism for designing and measuring an indicator called Social Presence (SP), which allows to represent the relevance of users when they are gradually participating in a collaborative activity. Thus, teams of users can be supported for decision-making with an indicator that mostly reflects teamwork and not only individual work. In order to propose this mechanism, we designed an algorithm to measure social presence from the results of the objectives and tasks associated to a collaborative activity. For evaluating this algorithm, we implemented an experiment with 24 users, which allowed us to obtain a dataset with team information from a groupware called AssaultCube-a collaborative First-Person-Shooter type videogame. The obtained results evidence that performance measurement on teams can still be improved. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Twitter has become one of the major platforms for self-expression in the Social Web, mostly due to its adoption by mobile users and its short message format. This presents endless possibilities for social behavior researchers that, for the first time, have access to massive amounts of data generated by humans. Nevertheless, most of the current research on emotions in social platforms focuses on reactions to particular events, or crowd behavior. In this article we present our research in the identification and characterization of user sentiment profiles in online social media. By analyzing a dataset of more than 36,000 users, we identify several distinctive groups, according to similarities in their sentiment behavior. We study differences and similarities between these profile clusters and present detailed statistics. We found that a large number of Twitter users can be grouped in nine distinct profiles according to the strength and polarity of their sentiment. Researchers and practitioners can benefit from our approach to characterize Twitter users in several scenarios, such as social recommendation, and mood estimation.},

abstract={We present insights from a gesture elicitation study conducted for TV control, during which 18 participants contributed gesture commands and rated the execution difficulty and recall likeliness of free-hand gestures for 21 television control tasks. Our study complements previous work on gesture interaction design for the TV set with the first exploration of fine-grained resolution 3-D finger movements and hand gestures. We report lower agreement rates than previous gesture studies ($${\mathcal {AR}}=.158$$AR=.158) with 72.8 % recall rate and 15.8 % false positives, results that are explained by the complexity and variability of unconstrained finger and hand gestures. However, our observations also confirm previous findings, such as people preferring related gestures for dichotomous tasks and more disagreement occurring for abstract tasks, such as “open browser” or “show the list of channels” for our specific TV scenario. To reach a better understanding of our participants’ preferences for articulating finger and hand gestures, we defined five measures for Leap Motion gestures, such as gesture volume and finger-to-palm distance, which we employed to evaluate gestures performed by our participants. We also contribute a set of guidelines for practitioners interested in designing free-hand gestures for interactive TV scenarios involving similar gesture acquisition technology. We release our dataset consisting in 378 Leap Motion gestures described by fingertips position, direction, and velocity coordinates to foster further studies in the community. This first exploration of viewers’ preferences for fine-grained resolution free-hand gestures for TV control represents one more step toward designing low-effort gesture interfaces for lean-back interaction with the TV set. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.},

Current machine learning techniques focus mostly on curated training sets of image-label pairs, and perform image classification given the pixels within the image. In this work we instead leverage the wealth of information available from users: firstly, we employ user hashtags to capture the description of image content; and secondly, we make use of valuable contextual information about the user. We show how user metadata (age, gender, etc.) combined with image features derived from a convolutional neural network can be used to perform hashtag prediction. We explore two ways of combining these heterogeneous features into a learning framework: (i) simple concatenation; and (ii) a 3-way multiplicative gating, where the image model is conditioned on the user metadata. We apply these models to a large dataset of de-identified Facebook posts and demonstrate that modeling the user can significantly improve the tag prediction quality over current state-of-the-art methods. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={For many users on social networks, one of the goals when broadcasting content is to reach a large audience. The probability of receiving reactions to a message differs for each user and depends on various factors, such as location, daily and weekly behavior patterns and the visibility of the message. While previous work has focused on overall network dynamics and message flow cascades, the problem of recommending personalized posting times has remained an under-explored topic of research. In this study, we formulate a when-to-post problem, where the objective is to find the best times for a user to post on social networks in order to maximize the probability of audience responses. To understand the complexity of the problem, we examine user behavior in terms of post-to-reaction times, and compare cross-network and cross-city weekly reaction behavior for users in different cities, on both Twitter and Facebook. We perform this analysis on over a billion posted messages and observed reactions, and propose multiple approaches for generating personalized posting schedules. We empirically assess these schedules on a sampled user set of 0.5 million active users and more than 25 million messages observed over a 56 day period. We show that users see a reaction gain of up to 17% on Facebook and 4% on Twitter when the recommended posting times are used. We open the dataset used in this study, which includes timestamps for over 144 million posts and over 1.1 billion reactions. The personalized schedules derived here are used in a fully deployed production system to recommend posting times for millions of users every day.},

abstract={Background: Motivated by the general need to identify and classify species based on molecular evidence, genome comparisons have been proposed that are based on measuring mostly Euclidean distances between Chaos Game Representation (CGR) patterns of genomic DNA sequences. Results: We provide, on an extensive dataset and using several different distances, confirmation of the hypothesis that CGR patterns are preserved along a genomic DNA sequence, and are different for DNA sequences originating from genomes of different species. This finding lends support to the theory that CGRs of genomic sequences can act as graphic genomic signatures. In particular, we compare the CGR patterns of over five hundred different 150,000 bp genomic sequences spanning one complete chromosome from each of six organisms, representing all kingdoms of life: H. sapiens (Animalia; chromosome 21), S. cerevisiae (Fungi; chromosome 4), A. thaliana (Plantae; chromosome 1), P. falciparum (Protista; chromosome 14), E. coli (Bacteria - full genome), and P. furiosus (Archaea - full genome). To maximize the diversity within each species, we also analyze the interrelationships within a set of over five hundred 150,000 bp genomic sequences sampled from the entire aforementioned genomes. Lastly, we provide some preliminary evidence of this method's ability to classify genomic DNA sequences at lower taxonomic levels by comparing sequences sampled from the entire genome of H. sapiens (class Mammalia, order Primates) and of M. musculus (class Mammalia, order Rodentia), for a total length of approximately 174 million basepairs analyzed. We compute pairwise distances between CGRs of these genomic sequences using six different distances, and construct Molecular Distance Maps, which visualize all sequences as points in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space, to simultaneously display their interrelationships. Conclusion: Our analysis confirms, for this dataset, that CGR patterns of DNA sequences from the same genome are in general quantitatively similar, while being different for DNA sequences from genomes of different species. Our assessment of the performance of the six distances analyzed uses three different quality measures and suggests that several distances outperform the Euclidean distance, which has so far been almost exclusively used for such studies. © 2015 Karamichalis et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={The concept of "event" emerged in recent years as a key feature to efficiently index and retrieve media. Several approaches have been proposed to analyze the relationship between events and media, enable event discovery, and perform event-based media tagging, indexing, and retrieval. Despite the outstanding work done in this area, a major problem that remains open is how to infer the link between visual concepts and events. In particular, the possibility of understanding which perceptual elements allow a human recognizing the event depicted by an image would open new directions in event media discovery. In this paper we introduce the concept of event saliency to define the above event-revealing perceptual elements, and we propose an original method to detect it by exploiting crowd knowledge through gamification. We propose an adversarial game with a hidden purpose, where users are engaged in competitive roles: masking photos to prevent competitors recognizing the related event, and discovering events in photos masked by other players. Rules and incentives are defined to minimize cheating and force players to focus on details that really matter. A suitable algorithm composes the masks created by different players on the same media, thus producing a saliency map that, different from the traditional concept of saliency, does not focus on perceptual prominence but rather on event-related semantics of media.

abstract={Abstract Lesion analysis reveals causal contributions of brain regions to mental functions, aiding the understanding of normal brain function as well as rehabilitation of brain-damaged patients. We applied a novel lesion inference technique based on game theory, Multi-perturbation Shapley value Analysis (MSA), to a large clinical lesion dataset. We used MSA to analyze the lesion patterns of 148 acute stroke patients together with their neurological deficits, as assessed by the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). The results revealed regional functional contributions to essential behavioral and cognitive functions as reflected in the NIHSS, particularly by subcortical structures. There were also side specific differences of functional contributions between the right and left hemispheric brain regions which may reflect the dominance of the left hemispheric syndrome aphasia in the NIHSS. Comparison of MSA to established lesion inference methods demonstrated the feasibility of the approach for analyzing clinical data and indicated its capability for objectively inferring functional contributions from multiple injured, potentially interacting sites, at the cost of having to predict the outcome of unknown lesion configurations. The analysis of regional functional contributions to neurological symptoms measured by the NIHSS contributes to the interpretation of this widely used standardized stroke scale in clinical practice as well as clinical trials and provides a first approximation of a 'map of stroke'. © 2015 The Authors.},

abstract={Probabilistic logic programming can be used to model domains with complex and uncertain relationships among entities. While the problem of learning the parameters of such programs has been considered by various authors, the problem of learning the structure is yet to be explored in depth. In this work we present an approximate search method based on a one-player game approach, called LEMUR. It sees the problem of learning the structure of a probabilistic logic program as a multi-armed bandit problem, relying on the Monte-Carlo tree search UCT algorithm that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. LEMUR works by modifying the UCT algorithm in a fashion similar to FUSE, that considers a finite unknown horizon and deals with the problem of having a huge branching factor. The proposed system has been tested on various real-world datasets and has shown good performance with respect to other state of the art statistical relational learning approaches in terms of classification abilities. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={Considering the enormous creation rate of usergenerated videos on websites like YouTube, there is an immediate need for automatic categorization, recognition and analysis of videos. To develop algorithms for analyzing user-generated videos, unconstrained and representative datasets are of great significance. For this purpose, we collected a dataset of Sports Videos in the Wild (SVW), consisting of videos captured by users of the leading sports training mobile app (Coach's Eye) while practicing a sport or watching a game. The dataset contains 4100 videos selected by reviewing ∼85,000 videos and consists of 30 sports categories and 44 actions. Videos of sports practice, which frequently happens outside the typical sports field, have huge intra-class variations due to background clutter, unrepresentative environment, existence of different training equipment and most importantly, imperfect actions. On the other hand, using smartphones for video capturing by ordinary people, in comparison to videos captured by professional crew for broadcasting, leads to challenges due to camera vibration and motion, occlusion, view point variation, and poor illumination. Given various manual labels, this dataset can be used for a wide range of computer vision applications, such as action recognition, action detection, genre categorization, and spatio-temporal alignment. On the sport genre categorization problem, we design the evaluation protocol and evaluate three different methods to provide baselines for future works. © 2015 IEEE.},

Recent methods aimed at optimizing the socalled modularity function proceed by maximizing relations within communities while minimizing inter-community relations. However, given the NP-completeness of the problem, these algorithms are heuristics that do not guarantee an optimum. In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm along with a function that takes an approximate solution and modi-es it in order to reach an optimum. This reassignment function is considered a 'potential function' and becomes a necessary condition to asserting that the computed optimum is indeed a Nash Equilibrium. We also use this function to simultaneously show two detection and visualization modes: partitioned and overlaped communities, of great value in revealing interesting features in a social network. Our approach is successfully illustrated through several experiments on either real unipartite, multipartite or directed graphs of medium and large-sized datasets. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that computes the radius and the diameter of a weakly connected digraph G=. (. V, E), by finding bounds through heuristics and improving them until they are validated. Although the worst-case running time is O(|V||E|), we will experimentally show that it performs much better in the case of real-world networks, finding the radius and diameter values after 10-100 BFSs instead of |. V| BFSs (independently of the value of |. V|), and thus having running time O(|E|) in practice. As far as we know, this is the first algorithm able to compute the diameter of weakly connected digraphs, apart from the naive algorithm, which runs in time Ω(|. V||. E|) performing a BFS from each node. In the particular cases of strongly connected directed or connected undirected graphs, we will compare our algorithm with known approaches by performing experiments on a dataset composed by several real-world networks of different kinds. These experiments will show that, despite its generality, the new algorithm outperforms all previous methods, both in the radius and in the diameter computation, both in the directed and in the undirected case, both in average running time and in robustness. Finally, as an application example, we will use the new algorithm to determine the solvability over time of the "Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon" game, and of the "Six Degrees of Wikipedia" game. As a consequence, we will compute for the first time the exact value of the radius and the diameter of the whole Wikipedia digraph. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

TopCoder algorithm contests run single-round matches (SRM) with the challenge phase that allows participants to find bugs in the submitted program and eliminate their opponents. In the paper, we introduce a game theoretic model to study the competitive behaviors in the challenge phase of SRM. By analyzing the Nash Equilibrium of our multiple-person game model, we find that the probability of making a successful challenge and effort cost are the major factors for contestants' decisions. To verify the theoretic result, we make empirical data analysis with the dataset collected from the algorithm challenge phase on TopCoder. And the results indicate that contestants with a high rating are more likely to launch challenges against lower ones. However, contestants with the highest rating may be unwilling to challenge to avoid risks of losing their points in the contests. © 2015 IEEE.},

Results on all three variants of the CCA models, namely linear CCA, kernel CCA and CCA with k-nearest neighbor (CCA-KNN) clustering, are reported. The best results are obtained using CCA-KNN which outperforms previous results on the Corel-5k and the ESP-Game datasets and achieves comparable results on the IAPRTC-12 dataset. In our experiments we evaluate CNN features in the existing models which bring out the advantages of it over dozens of handcrafted features. We also demonstrate that word embedding vectors perform better than binary vectors as a representation of the tags associated with an image. In addition we compare the CCA model to a simple CNN based linear regression model, which allows the CNN layers to be trained using back-propagation. © Copyright 2015 ACM.},

However, it is still of great challenge to model the temporal dynamics of the human actions and great potential can be exploited to further enhance the retrieval accuracy by adequately modeling the patterns of these actions. To address this challenge, we propose a temporal order-preserving dynamic quantization method to extract the most discriminative patterns of the action sequence. We further present a multimodal feature fusion method that can be derived in this dynamic quantization framework to exploit different discriminative capability of features from multiple modalities. Experiments based on three public human action datasets show that the proposed technique has achieved state-of-theart performance. Copyright © 2015 ACM.},

Four-dimensional performance capture is used to capture realistic human motion and appearance. The captured data is processed into efficient and compact representations for geometry and texture. Motions are analysed against a high-level, user-defined motion graph and suitable inter- and intra-motion transitions are identified. This processed data is stored on a webserver and downloaded by a client application when required. A Javascript-based character animation engine is used to manage the state of the character which responds to user input and sends required frames to a WebGL-based renderer for display. Through the efficient geometry, texture and motion graph representations, a game character capable of performing a range of motions can be represented in 40-50 MB of data. This highlights the potential use of four-dimensional performance capture for creating web-based content.

abstract={The main goal of this paper is to develop a theory of inference of player valuations from observed data in the generalized second price auction without relying on the Nash equilibrium assumption. Existing work in Economics on inferring agent values from data relies on the assumption that all participant strategies are best responses of the observed play of other players, i.e. they constitute a Nash equilibrium. In this paper, we show how to perform inference relying on a weaker assumption instead: assuming that players are using some form of no-regret learning. Learning outcomes emerged in recent years as an attractive alternative to Nash equilibrium in analyzing game outcomes, modeling players who haven't reached a stable equilibrium, but rather use algorithmic learning, aiming to learn the best way to play from previous observations. In this paper we show how to infer values of players who use algorithmic learning strategies. Such inference is an important first step before we move to testing any learning theoretic behavioral model on auction data. We apply our techniques to a dataset from Microsoft's sponsored search ad auction system.},

abstract={Current algorithms for the standard multi-armed bandit problem have good empirical performance and optimal regret bounds. However, real-world problems often differ from the standard formulation in several ways. First, feedback may be delayed instead of arriving immediately. Second, the real world often contains structure which suggests heuristics, which we wish to incorporate while retaining strong theoretical guarantees. Third, we may wish to make use of an arbitrary prior dataset without negatively impacting performance. Fourth, we may wish to efficiently evaluate algorithms using a previously collected dataset. Surprisingly, these seemingly-disparate problems can be addressed using algorithms inspired by a recently-developed queueing technique. We present the Stochastic Delayed Bandits (SDB) algorithm as a solution to these four problems, which takes black-box bandit algorithms (including heuristic approaches) as input while achieving good theoretical guarantees. We present empirical results from both synthetic simulations and real-world data drawn from an educational game. Our results show that SDB outperforms state-of-the-art approaches to handling delay, heuristics, prior data, and evaluation.

The optimal selection of these target users takes into account both the damage that can be caused by a user and the probability of a malicious e-mail being delivered to and opened by a user. Since attackers select their targets in a strategic way, the optimal mitigation of these attacks requires the defender to also personalize the e-mail filters by taking into account the users' properties. In this paper, we assume that a learned classifier is given and propose strategic per-user filtering thresholds for mitigating spear-phishing attacks. We formulate the problem of filtering targeted and non-targeted malicious e-mails as a Stackelberg security game. We characterize the optimal filtering strategies and show how to compute them in practice. Finally, we evaluate our results using two real-world datasets and demonstrate that the proposed thresholds lead to lower losses than non-strategic thresholds.

abstract={Graph partitioning has attracted considerable attention due to its high practicality for real-world applications. It is particularly relevant to social networks because it enables the grouping of users into communities for market analysis and advertising purposes. In this paper, we introduce RMGP, a type of real-time multi-criteria graph partitioning for social networks that groups the users based on their connectivity and their similarity to a set of input classes. We consider RMGP as an on-line task, which may be frequently performed for different query parameters (e.g., classes). In order to overcome the serious performance issues associated with the large social graphs found in practice, we develop solutions based on a game theoretic framework. Specifically, we consider each user as a player, whose goal is to find the class that optimizes his objective function. We propose algorithms based on best-response dynamics, analyze their properties, and show their efficiency and effectiveness on real datasets under centralized and decentralized scenarios.

abstract={We propose a computational method to measure and visualize interrelationships among any number of DNA sequences allowing, for example, the examination of hundreds or thousands of complete mitochondrial genomes. An "image distance" is computed for each pair of graphical representations of DNA sequences, and the distances are visualized as a Molecular Distance Map: Each point on the map represents a DNA sequence, and the spatial proximity between any two points reflects the degree of structural similarity between the corresponding sequences. The graphical representation of DNA sequences utilized, Chaos Game Representation (CGR), is genome- and species-specific and can thus act as a genomic signature. Consequently, Molecular Distance Maps could inform species identification, taxonomic classifications and, to a certain extent, evolutionary history. The image distance employed, Structural Dissimilarity Index (DSSIM), implicitly compares the occurrences of oligomers of length up to k (herein k = 9) in DNA sequences. We computed DSSIM distances for more than 5 million pairs of complete mitochondrial genomes, and used Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) to obtain Molecular Distance Maps that visually display the sequence relatedness in various subsets, at different taxonomic levels. This general-purpose method does not require DNA sequence alignment and can thus be used to compare similar or vastly different DNA sequences, genomic or computer-generated, of the same or different lengths. We illustrate potential uses of this approach by applying it to several taxonomic subsets: phylum Vertebrata, (super)kingdom Protista, classes Amphibia-Insecta-Mammalia, class Amphibia, and order Primates. This analysis of an extensive dataset confirms that the oligomer composition of full mtDNA sequences can be a source of taxonomic information. This method also correctly finds the mtDNA sequences most closely related to that of the anatomically modern human (the Neanderthal, the Denisovan, and the chimp), and that the sequence most different from it in this dataset belongs to a cucumber. © 2015 Kari et al.

abstract={Background: Regular physical activity is beneficial to the health of both people and animals. The role of regular exercise undertaken together, such as dog walking, is a public health interest of mutual benefit. Exploration of barriers and incentives to regular dog walking by owners is now required so that effective interventions to promote it can be designed. This study explored a well-characterised cross-sectional dataset of 276 dogs and owners from Cheshire, UK, for evidence of factors associated with the dog being walked once or more per day. Results: Factors independently associated with daily walking included: number of dogs owned (multiple (vs. single) dogs negatively associated); size (medium and possibly large dogs (vs. small) positively associated); and number of people in the household (more people negatively associated). Furthermore, a number of factors related to the dog-owner relationship and the dog's behaviour were associated with daily walking, including: having acquired the dog for a hobby (positively associated); dog lying on furniture (positively associated); dog lying on laps (negatively associated); growling at household members (negatively associated); and playing chase games with the dog (negatively associated). Conclusions: These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the strength and nature of the human-dog relationship incentivises dog walking, and that behavioural and demographic factors may affect dog walking via this mechanism. Future studies need to investigate how dog demographic and behavioural factors, plus owner behavioural factors and perceptions of the dog, influence the dog-human relationship in respect to the perceived support and motivation a dog can provide for walking. © Westgarth et al.; licensee BioMed Central.},

abstract={Video sharing and entertainment websites have rapidly grown in popularity and now constitute some of the most visited websites on the Internet. Despite the high usage and user engagement, most of recent research on online media plat- forms have restricted themselves to networking based social media sites like Facebook or Twitter. The current study is among the first to perform a large-scale empirical study us- ing longitudinal video upload data from one of the largest online video sites. Unlike previous studies in the online media space that have focussed exclusively on demand-side research questions, we model the supply-side of the crowd- contributed video ecosystem on this platform. The modeling and subsequent prediction of video uploads is made compli- cated by the heterogeneity of video types (e.g. popular vs. niche video genres), and the inherent time trend effects. We identify distinct genre-clusters from our dataset and employ a self-exciting Hawkes point-process model on each of these clusters to fully specify and estimate the video upload pro- cess. Our findings show that using a relatively parsimonious point-process model, we are able to achieve higher model fit, and predict video uploads to the platform with a higher accuracy than competing models.},

abstract={The wide adaptation of mobile devices embedded with mod- ern positioning technology enables the collection of valuable mobility data from users. At the same time, the large-scale user-generated data from social media, such as geo-tagged tweets, provide rich semantic information about events and locations. The combination of the mobility data and social media data brings opportunities for us to study the seman- tics behind people's movement, i.e., understand why a per- son travels to a location at a particular time. Previous work have used map or POI (point of interest) database as source for semantics. However, those semantics are static, and thus missing important dynamic event information. To provide dynamic semantic annotation, we propose to use contextual social media. More specifically, the semantics could be land- mark information (e.g., a museum or an arena) or event in- formation (e.g., sports games or concerts). The annotation method annotates words to each mobility records based on local density of words, estimated by Kernel Density Esti- mation model. The annotated mobility data contain rich and interpretable information, therefore can bene t appli- cations, such as personalized recommendation, targeted ad- vertisement, and movement prediction. Our system is built upon large-scale tweet datasets. A user-friendly interface is designed to support interactive exploration of the result.},

abstract={Contests are widely used as a means for effort elicitation in settings ranging from government R&D contests to on-line crowdsourcing contests on platforms such as Kaggle, Innocentive, or TopCoder. Such rank-order mechanisms| where agents' rewards depend only on the relative ranking of their submissions' qualities|are natural mechanisms for incentivizing effort when it is easier to obtain ordinal, rather than cardinal, information about agents' outputs, or where absolute measures of quality are unverifiable. An increasing number of online contests, however, rank entries according to some numerical evaluation of their absolute quality|for instance, the performance of an algorithm on a test dataset, or the performance of an intervention in a randomized trial. Can the contest designer incentivize higher effort by making the rewards in an ordinal rank-order mechanism contingent on such cardinal information? We model and analyze cardinal contests, where a princi-pal running a rank-order tournament has access to an abso-lute measure of the qualities of agents' submissions in addi-tion to their relative rankings, and ask how modifying the rank-order tournament to incorporate cardinal information can improve incentives for effort. Our main result is that a simple threshold mechanism|a mechanism that awards the prize for a rank if and only if the absolute quality of the agent at that rank exceeds a certain threshold|is optimal amongst all mixed cardinal-ordinal mechanisms where the fraction of the jth prize awarded to the jth-ranked agent is any arbitrary non-decreasing function of her submission's quality. Further, the optimal threshold mechanism uses ex-actly the same threshold for each rank. We study what con-test parameters determine the extent of the benefit from in-corporating such cardinal information into an ordinal rank-order contest, and investigate the extent of improvement in equilibrium effort via numerical simulations.},

The reviews are often ranked based on user helpfulness votes to minimize the review information overload problem. This paper examines the factors that contribute towards helpfulness of online reviews and builds a predictive model. The proposed predictive model extracts novel linguistic category features by analysing the textual content of reviews. In addition, the model makes use of review metadata, subjectivity and readability related features for helpfulness prediction. Our experimental analysis on two real-life review datasets reveals that a hybrid set of features deliver the best predictive accuracy. We also show that the proposed linguistic category features are better predictors of review helpfulness for experience goods such as books, music, and video games.

abstract={Recommending new items for suitable users is an important yet challenging problem due to the lack of preference history for the new items. Noncollaborative user modeling techniques that rely on the item features can be used to recommend new items. However, they only use the past preferences of each user to provide recommendations for that user. They do not utilize information from the past preferences of other users, which can potentially be ignoring useful information. More recent factor models transfer knowledge across users using their preference information in order to provide more accurate recommendations. These methods learn a low-rank approximation for the preference matrix, which can lead to loss of information. Moreover, they might not be able to learn useful patterns given very sparse datasets. In this work, we present UFSM, a method for top-n recommendation of new items given binary user preferences. UFSM learns User-specific Feature-based item-Similarity Models, and its strength lies in combining two points: (1) exploiting preference information across all users to learn multiple global item similarity functions and (2) learning user-specific weights that determine the contribution of each global similarity function in generating recommendations for each user. UFSM can be considered as a sparse high-dimensional factor model where the previous preferences of each user are incorporated within his or her latent representation. This way, UFSM combines the merits of item similarity models that capture local relations among items and factor models that learn global preference patterns. A comprehensive set of experiments was conduced to compare UFSM against state-of-the-art collaborative factor models and noncollaborative user modeling techniques. Results show that UFSM outperforms other techniques in terms of recommendation quality. UFSM manages to yield better recommendations even with very sparse datasets. Results also show that UFSM can efficiently handle high-dimensional as well as low-dimensional item feature spaces. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Based on a graph-theoretic concept of a cluster, dominant sets clustering has been shown to be an attractive clustering algorithm with many useful properties. In this study, the authors conduct a comprehensive study of related issues in dominant sets clustering, in an endeavour to explore the potential of this algorithm and obtain the best clustering results. Specifically, they empirically investigate how similarity parameters, similarity measures and game dynamics influence the dominant sets clustering results. From experiments on eight datasets, they conclude that distance-based similarity measures perform evidently better than cosine and histogram intersection similarity measures potentially, and they need to find the bestperforming similarity parameter to make use of this advantage. They then study the effect of similarity parameter on dominant sets clustering results and induce the range of the best-performing similarity parameters. Furthermore, they find that the recently proposed infection and immunisation dynamics performs better than the replicator dynamics in most cases while being much more efficient than the latter. These observations are helpful in applying dominant sets clustering to practical problems, and also indicate directions for further improvement of this algorithm. © 2015.

This study widens the perspective from a firm’s absolute attributes to its relative positioning within its competitive environment. The hypotheses for the empirical analysis are derived from game theoretic models with either vertical or horizontal product differentiation. In each of the two theoretical models two incumbents initially choose very different quality and variety levels, respectively, and move closer to the center when faced by entry of a competitor. From the vertical differentiation model we predict a stronger price reduction by high-quality firms. In our empirical analysis we are using a novel dataset of the high-quality restaurant market in Germany to test the theoretical findings. While the hypotheses with respect to adjustments of prices and varieties are supported, we do not find empirical evidence for the predicted quality adjustment. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Mid-water pair trawling (PTM) targeting small pelagic resources represents a key fishing activity in the Adriatic Sea. This fishery is experiencing a long period of crisis due to resource depletion and the lack of appropriate market strategies, and vessels spend most of the time searching for fishing schools. The searching strategy largely depends on the interaction between vessels: the captains of the PTM units take their decision also checking the position and the fishing status of other vessels. Understanding this strategy represents a key step towards a more effective resource management, since strategies directly determine the pattern of fishing effort. A Conditional Logit model has been devised to analyze fishermen's strategy as a non-cooperative game. This category of games is characterized by the existence of (at least) one equilibrium point - a Nash Equilibrium - in which each player plays his strategy, that is a Best Response to the strategies of the other players. This equilibrium point was estimated for the different scenarios defined by environmental (sea surface temperature and atmospheric pressure) and economic (fuel and fish prices at market) variables. Vessel Monitoring System data were used to capture fleet activity, while different datasets were collected to reconstruct environmental and economic drivers. Results indicate a good predictive power of the model, and suggest that the equilibrium strategy that guides units' behaviour is invariant with respect to environmental conditions, whereas it is largely influenced by economic factors. These latter, via strategies, may determine important consequences on the resources in terms of exploited areas and the impact of fishing activity. In particular, a low fuel price when fish price is high leads to higher values of CPUE, and then to a more efficient but also impacting fishing activity. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Social media provides valuable resources to analyze user behaviors and capture user preferences. This article focuses on analyzing user behaviors in social media systems and designing a latent class statistical mixture model, named temporal context-aware mixture model (TCAM), to account for the intentions and preferences behind user behaviors. Based on the observation that the behaviors of a user in social media systems are generally influenced by intrinsic interest as well as the temporal context (e.g., the public's attention at that time), TCAM simultaneously models the topics related to users' intrinsic interests and the topics related to temporal context and then combines the influences from the two factors to model user behaviors in a unified way. Considering that users' interests are not always stable and may change over time, we extend TCAM to a dynamic temporal context-aware mixture model (DTCAM) to capture users' changing interests. To alleviate the problem of data sparsity, we exploit the social and temporal correlation information by integrating a social-temporal regularization framework into the DTCAM model. To further improve the performance of our proposed models (TCAM and DTCAM), an item-weighting scheme is proposed to enable them to favor items that better represent topics related to user interests and topics related to temporal context, respectively. Based on our proposed models, we design a temporal context-aware recommender system (TCARS). To speed up the process of producing the top-k recommendations from large-scale social media data, we develop an efficient query-processing technique to support TCARS. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of our models on four real-world datasets crawled from different social media sites. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our models, compared with the state-of-the-art competitor methods, by modeling user behaviors more precisely and making more effective and efficient recommendations. © 2015 ACM 1046-8188/2015/03-ART10 $15.00.},

abstract={Sport video analysis facilitates the discovery of semantic structures in sport broadcast videos and enables a wide spectrum of applications. For example, coaches can analyze offensive and defensive plays performed during games to assess a team's capabilities. In general, identifying interested shots, e.g. pitch shots, from broadcast baseball videos requires great human labor to browse through those videos. In this work, we proposed a novel technique that automatically extracts pitch-by-pitch shots by recognizing the reliable emergence of pitching speed displayed on the scoreboard, estimating when and where the pitcher is present, and identifying the pitch shots based on the pitcher's motion degree. To validate the performance and accuracy of the proposed technique, we collected a dataset of baseball videos broadcasted in various countries. The experimental results verify that the proposed technique successfully extracts the desired pitch-by-pitch videos. Furthermore, it outperforms the state-of-the-art approach in terms of accuracy and time complexity. © 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The realization of the Web as a common platform, medium, and interface for supporting human activities has attracted many researchers to the study of Web-based support systems (WSS). An important branch of WSS is Web-based decision support systems that provide intelligent support for making effective decisions in different domains. We focus on decision making inWeb-based medical decision support systems (WMDSS). Uncertainty is a critical factor that affects decision making and reasoning in the medical field. A three-way decision-making approach is an effective and better choice to lessen the effects of uncertainty. It provides the provision for delaying certain or definite decisions in situations that lack sufficient evidence or accurate information in reaching certain conclusions. Particularly, the option of deferment decisions is added in this approach that provides the flexibility to further examine and investigate the uncertain and doubtful cases. The game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model is a recent development in rough sets that can be used to determine the three rough set regions in the probabilistic rough sets framework by determining a pair of thresholds. The three regions are used to obtain three-way decision rules in the form of acceptance, rejection, and deferment rules. In this paper, we extend the GTRS model to analyze uncertainty involved in medical decision making. Experimental results with aGTRS-based approach on different health care datasets suggest that the approach may improve the overall quality of decision making in the medical field, as well as other fields. It is hoped that the incorporation of a GTRS component in WMDSS will enrich and enhance its decision-making capabilities. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Hand gestures are a powerful way for human communication, with lots of potential applications in the area of human computer interaction. Vision-based hand gesture recognition techniques have many advantages compared with traditional devices, giving users a simpler and more natural way to communicate with electronic devices. This work proposes a generic system architecture based in computer vision and machine learning, able to be used with any interface for real-time human-machine interaction. Its novelty is the integration of different tools for gesture spotting and the proposed solution is mainly composed of three modules: a pre-processing and hand segmentation module, a static gesture interface module and a dynamic gesture interface module. The experiments showed that the core of vision-based interaction systems could be the same for all applications and thus facilitate the implementation. For hand posture recognition, a SVM (Support Vector Machine) model was trained with a centroid distance dataset composed of 2170 records, able to achieve a final accuracy of 99.4 %. For dynamic gestures, an HMM (Hidden Markov Model) model was trained for each one of the defined gestures that the system should recognize with a final average accuracy of 93.7 %. The datasets were built from four different users with a total of 25 gestures per user, totalling 1100 records for model construction. The proposed solution has the advantage of being generic enough with the trained models able to work in real-time, allowing its application in a wide range of human-machine applications. To validate the proposed framework two applications were implemented. The first one is a real-time system able to interpret the Portuguese Sign Language. The second one is an online system able to help a robotic soccer game referee judge a game in real-time. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={We present a neural network method for review rating prediction in this paper. Existing neural network methods for sentiment prediction typically only capture the semantics of texts, but ignore the user who expresses the sentiment. This is not desirable for review rating prediction as each user has an influence on how to interpret the textual content of a review. For example, the same word (e.g. "good") might indicate different sentiment strengths when written by different users. We address this issue by developing a new neural network that takes user information into account. The intuition is to factor in user-specific modification to the meaning of a certain word. Specifically, we extend the lexical semantic composition models and introduce a userword composition vector model (UWCVM), which effectively captures how user acts as a function affecting the continuous word representation. We integrate UWCVM into a supervised learning framework for review rating prediction, and conduct experiments on two benchmark review datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. It shows superior performances over several strong baseline methods.},

More specifically, AutoRhythm can automatically generate the hit time of the given music, either locally or via server-based computation, such that users can use the user-supplied music for the game directly. Moreover, to make the rhythm game more realistic, AutoRhythm allows users to interact with the game via any objects that can produce percussion sound, such as a pen or a chopstick hitting on the table. AutoRhythm can identify the percussions in real time while the music is playing. The identification is based on the power spectrum of each frame of the recording which combines percussions and playback music. Based on a test dataset of 12 recordings (with 2455 percussions of 4 types), our experiment indicates an F-measure of 96.79%, which is satisfactory for the purpose of the game. The flexibility of being able to use any user-supplied music for the game and to identify user-defined percussions from any objects available at hand makes the game innovative and unique of its kind. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={With current growth of internet sales and content consumption, more research efforts are focusing on developing recommendation and personalization algorithms as a solution for the choice overload problem. In this paper, we first enumerate several state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms in order to highlight their main ideas and methodologies. Then, we propose a generic architecture for recommender systems benchmarking. Using the proposed architecture, we implement and evaluate several variants of existing recommendation algorithms and compare their results to our unified recommendation model. The experiments are conducted on a real world dataset in order to assess the genericity of our recommendation model and its quality. At the end, we conclude with some ideas for further development and research.},

abstract={Pairwise (or graph-based) clustering algorithms typically assume the existence of a single affinity matrix, which describes the similarity between the objects to be clustered. In many practical applications, however, several similarity relations might be envisaged and the problem arises as to how properly select or combine them. In this paper we offer a solution to this problem for the case of dominant sets, a well-known formalization of the notion of a cluster, which generalizes the notion of maximal clique to edge-weighted graphs and has intriguing connections to evolutionary game theory. Specifically, it has been shown that dominant sets can be bijectively related to Evolutionary Stable Strategies (ESS) - a classic notion of equilibrium in the evolutionary game theory field - of a so-called “clustering game”. The clustering game is a non-cooperative game between two-players, where the objects to cluster form the set of strategies, while the affinity matrix provides the players’ payoffs. The proposed approach generalizes dominant sets to multiple affinities by extending the clustering game, which has a single payoff, to a multi-payoff game. Accordingly, dominant sets in the multi-affinity setting become equivalent to ESSs of a corresponding multi-payoff clustering game, which can be found by means of so-called Biased Replicator Dynamics. Experiments conducted over standard benchmark datasets consistently show that the proposed combination scheme allows one to substantially improve the performance of dominant-set clustering over its single-affinity counterpart. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Collaborative filtering (CF) over large datasets requires significant computing power. Due to this data owning organizations often outsource the computation of CF (including some abstraction of the data itself) to a public cloud infrastructure. However, this leads to the question of how to verify the integrity of the outsourced computation. In this paper, we develop verification mechanisms for two popular item based collaborative filtering techniques. We further analyze the cheating behavior of the cloud from the game-theoretic perspective. Coupled with the right incentives, we can ensure that the computation is incentive compatible thus ensuring that a rational adversary will not cheat. Leveraging this, we can develop efficient and effective mechanisms to address the problem of integrity in outsourcing. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={While reusing research data has evident benefits for the scientific community as a whole, decisions to archive and share these data are primarily made by individual researchers. In this paper we analyse, within a game theoretical framework, how sharing and reuse of research data affect individuals who share or do not share their datasets. We construct a model in which there is a cost associated with sharing datasets whereas reusing such sets implies a benefit. In our calculations, conflicting interests appear for researchers. Individual researchers are always better off not sharing and omitting the sharing cost, at the same time both sharing and not sharing researchers are better off if (almost) all researchers share. Namely, the more researchers share, the more benefit can be gained by the reuse of those datasets.We simulated several policy measures to increase benefits for researchers sharing or reusing datasets. Results point out that, although policies should be able to increase the rate of sharing researchers, and increased discoverability and dataset quality could partly compensate for costs, a better measure would be to directly lower the cost for sharing, or even turn it into a (citation-) benefit. Making data available would in that case become the most profitable, and therefore stable, strategy. This means researchers would willingly make their datasets available, and arguably in the best possible way to enable reuse. © 2015 Pronk et al.},

abstract={In this work we propose a framework for predicting chess match outcome while the game is in progress. We make this prediction by examining the moves made by the players. For this purpose, we propose a novel ensemble based learning technique where a profile-based segmentation is done on the training dataset, and one classifier is trained from each such segment. Then the ensemble of classifiers is used to predict the outcome of new chess matches. When a new game is being played this ensemble model is used to dynamically predict the probabilities of white winning, black winning, and drawing after every move. We have evaluated our system with different base learning techniques as well as with different types of features and applied our technique on a large corpus of real chess matches, achieving higher prediction accuracies than traditional classification techniques. We have achieved prediction accuracies close to 66% and most of the correct predictions were made with nine or more moves before the game ended. We believe that this work will motivate the development of online prediction systems for other games, such as other board games and even some field games. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

However, the main disadvantage of supervised segmentation is a need for manual image annotation that is time-consuming and subjected to human error. To reduce the need for manual annotation, we propose a novel learning approach for training dataset reinforcement in the area of landmark-based segmentation, where newly detected landmarks are optimally combined with reference landmarks from the training dataset and therefore enriches the training process. The approach is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem, where the solution is a vector of weighting factors that measures how reliable are the detected landmarks. The detected landmarks that are found to be more reliable are included into the training procedure with higher weighting factors, whereas the detected landmarks that are found to be less reliable are included with lower weighting factors. The approach is integrated into the landmark-based game-theoretic segmentation framework and validated against the problem of lung field segmentation from chest radiographs. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={In this paper, an online rating game called Image-Battle is developed to build the ground truth dataset for image sentiment analysis. Our goal is to provide more interesting and intuitive interface to users and to collect the images with more correct sentiment scores despite of less human intervention. For this, two schemes are designed: 1) a pairwise competition and 2) a ranking algorithm based on visual link analysis. First, the system shows two images and asks the user which image is closer to a given sentiment. Thereafter, the ranking algorithm assigns the sentiment scores to the images based on all the competition results: the main idea is to give higher score to images that win more or to the images that beat images with high scores. To evaluate the proposed system, it was used to collect ground truth for 30,000 Photo.net images, each of which was labeled by six emotions. The ground truth was used to develop the sentiment recognition system, and its result was compared with that of other rating system. Then the result proved the excellence of the proposed method in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction. Copyright 2015 © ACM.},

abstract={The h-index is a very well known metric used to measure scientific throughput, but it also has well known limitations. In this paper we use a metric based on pagerank algorithm, which we call the p-index, to compare the performance of scientists. We use a real-world dataset to which we apply our analysis: a dataset of scientists from the field of quantum game theory. This dataset is cured by us for this study from Google Scholar. We show that whereas the popularly used h-index rewards authors who collaborate extensively and publish in higher volumes, the p-index rewards hardworking authors who contribute more to each paper they write, as well as authors who publish in high impact and well cited journals. As such, it could be argued that the p-index is a 'fairer' metric of the productivity and impact of scientists. Of particular note is that the p-index does not use the so called 'impact factors' of journals, the utility of which is debated ins scientific community. Rather, the p-index relies on the actual underlying citation network to measure the real impact of each paper. Furthermore, the p-index relies not only on the number of citations but also on the quality of citations of each paper. Using p-index, we highlight and compare the impact of real world scientists on the field of quantum game theory. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={With the evolution of various new types of application services for mobile devices, cellular operators have started providing multiple subscription plans to the mobile users. The plan subscribed determines the Quality of Service (QoS) to be provided to the user, and operators distinguish users as priority users and non-priority users, accordingly. To ensure better QoS to the priority users, necessary resources must be reserved at the base station. This demands analyzing the network traffic to predict future traffic pattern. This paper pioneers the use of machine learning methods to forecast mobile user traffic pattern for providing better QoS to the priority users. We analyze two different supervised learning methods, Naive Bayes Classifier and Logistic Regression, used for prediction of probable times when a priority user would be active. The prediction results are applied to the user scheduling strategies for efficient bandwidth management, thus improving system capacity and reduce blocking. Simulations on multiple real-life datasets validate the model and predict the mobile user pattern with very high accuracy, along with significant reduction in priority user service blocking ratio and improvement in their capacity. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={When searching for items online there are three common problems that e-buyers may encounter; null retrieval, retrieving unmanageable number of items, and retrieving unsatisfactory items. In the past information retrieval systems or recommender systems were used as solutions. With information retrieval systems, too rigorous filtering based on the user query to reduce unmanageable number of items result in either null retrieval or filtering out the items users prefer. Recommender systems on the other hand do not provide sufficient opportunity for users to communicate their needs. As a solution, this paper introduces a novel method combining a user model with an interactive product retrieval process. The new layered user model has the potential of being applied across multiple product and service domains and is able to adapt to changing user preferences. The new product retrieval algorithm is integrated with the user model and is able to successfully address null retrieval, retrieving unmanageable number of items, and retrieving unsatisfactory items. The process is demonstrated using a bench mark dataset and a case study. Finally the Product retrieval process is evaluated using a set of guidelines to illustrate its suitability to current eBuying environments. © 2015 Alahakoon.},

abstract={Nowadays, a recommendation system is an important technique in the development of electronic-commerce systems and the most popular approaches that use in many recommendation systems are a collaborative filtering algorithm. However, it still has problems such as scalability and sparse data. There are several previous methods used to deal with the weakness of collaborative filtering techniques such as a hybrid user model, but the results show their disadvantages in practical use. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid recommender system with review helpfulness features, which we have used to construct the hybrid model. In the experiment, the results of three recommendation techniques are compared: collaborative filtering based on hybrid user model, user-based collaborative filtering and our proposed method. The experimental results show that our proposed method is more efficient than other methods with the same dataset, in terms of accuracy. In addition, our proposed algorithm can decrease time consuming by constructing the hybrid model in the off-line phase and calculates the recommendation results in on-line phase. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Social Networks are popular platforms for users to express themselves, facilitate interactions, and share knowledge. Today, users in social networks have personalized profiles that contain their dynamic attributes representing their interest and behavior over time such as published content, and location check-ins. Several proposed models emerged that analyze those profiles with their dynamic content in order to measure the degree of similarity between users. This similarity value can be further used in friend suggesting and link prediction. The main drawback of the majority of these models is that they rely on a static snapshot of attributes which do not reflect the change in user interest and behavior over time. In this paper a novel framework for modeling the dynamic of user's behavior and measuring the similarity between users' profiles in twitter is proposed. In this proposed framework, dynamic attributes such as topical interests and the associated locations in tweets are used to represent user's interest and behavior respectively. Experiments on a real dataset from twitter showed that the proposed framework that utilizes those attributes outperformed multiple standard models that utilize a static snapshot of data.

Interestingly, there is a statistically significant difference between the Sunday vs. Thursday game margins over the first five weeks of the 2014 season. Moreover, statistical process control methods suggest an "out of control" condition for Thursday night game margins during the first five weeks of the 2014 season.

We use the joint-based covariance matrix over time as a discriminative descriptor for each human joint. Meanwhile, to encode the temporal information of the moving joints, multiple covariance matrices are deployed over sub-sequences that are different in temporal granularity. After that, we input the descriptor into multi-task sparse learning framework to obtain a more compact and discriminative action representation. The proposed method is evaluated on the sub-J-HMDB dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a good performance and is superior to some state-of-the-art approaches. © 2015 ACM.},

To do that, we will transform the whole linear model Beghdad R (Comput Commun 32:1104–1110, 2009 [1]) to a game theory model, and we will use the KDD99 (http://www.kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html, [2]) dataset to prove that we will obtain the same detection rates (DRs). In Beghdad R (Comput Commun 32:1104–1110, 2009 [1]), the author formulated the problem of intrusion detection as a linear programming system (LPS) to test if an unknown behavior is close enough to a known behavior (attack or normal) such as we can conclude that it belongs to its class. Simulations results show that we obtained exactly the same results as those cited in Beghdad R (Comput Commun 32:1104–1110, 2009 [1]), and that our approach outperforms a set of recent approaches focusing on U2R attacks detection. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={In this article, we consider how to automatically create pleasing photo collages created by placing a set of images on a limited canvas area. The task is formulated as an optimization problem. Differently from existing state-of-the-art approaches, we here exploit subjective experiments to model and learn pleasantness from user preferences. To this end, we design an experimental framework for the identification of the criteria that need to be taken into account to generate a pleasing photo collage. Five different thematic photo datasets are used to create collages using state-of-the-art criteria. A first subjective experiment where several subjects evaluated the collages, emphasizes that different criteria are involved in the subjective definition of pleasantness. We then identify new global and local criteria and design algorithms to quantify them. The relative importance of these criteria are automatically learned by exploiting the user preferences, and new collages are generated. To validate our framework, we performed several psycho-visual experiments involving different users. The results shows that the proposed framework allows to learn a novel computational model which effectively encodes an inter-user definition of pleasantness. The learned definition of pleasantness generalizes well to new photo datasets of different themes and sizes not used in the learning. Moreover, compared with two state-of-the-art approaches, the collages created using our framework are preferred by the majority of the users. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Grouping game players based on their online behaviors has attracted a lot of attention recently. However, due to the huge volume and extreme complexity in online game data collections, grouping players is a challenging task. This study has applied parallelized K-Means on Gordon, a supercomputer hosted at San Diego Supercomputer Center, to meet the computational challenge on this task. By using the parallelization functions supported by R, this study was able to cluster 120,000 game players into eight non-overlapping groups and speed up the clustering process by one to four times under the two- To eight-degree of parallelization. This study has systematically examined a number of factors which may affect the quality of the clusters and/or the performance of the clustering processes; those factors include degree of parallelism, number of clusters, data dimensions, and variable combinations. This study invented a method to identify the optimal clustering schema, which can choose the most discriminative features and create an appropriate number of clusters in K-Means clustering. Besides demonstrating the effectiveness of parallelized K-Means in grouping game players, this study also highlights some lessons learned for using K-Means on very large datasets and some experience on applying parallel processing techniques in intensive data analysis. © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Interdicting the flow of illegal goods (such as drugs and ivory) is a major security concern for many countries. The massive scale of these networks, however, forces defenders to make judicious use of their limited resources. While existing solutions model this problem as a Network Security Game (NSG), they do not consider humans’ bounded rationality. Previous human behavior modeling works in Security Games, however, make use of large training datasets that are unrealistic in realworld situations; the ability to effectively test many models is constrained by the time-consuming and complex nature of field deployments. In addition, there is an implicit assumption in these works that a model’s prediction accuracy strongly correlates with the performance of its corresponding defender strategy (referred to as predictive reliability). If the assumption of predictive reliability does not hold, then this could lead to substantial losses for the defender. In the following paper, we (1) first demonstrate that predictive reliability is indeed strong for previous Stackelberg Security Game experiments. We also run our own set of human subject experiments in such a way that models are restricted to learning on dataset sizes representative of real-world constraints. In the analysis on that data, we demonstrate that (2) predictive reliability is extremely weak for NSGs. Following that discovery, however, we identify (3) key factors that influence predictive reliability results: the training set’s exposed attack surface and graph structure. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Short messages are an important part of social media network. Besides traditional communications, short messages can also be used for education, entertainment and even business. Nowadays, much work has been devoted to mining useful information and knowledge from short messages via classification and clustering approaches. However, in many situations, it is vital to identify some influential users whose messages will result in a large amount of forwarding, these users are called seed users. In this paper, studies on the forwarding behavior of mobile phone users are carried out first, then, a directed graph-based short message forwarding model is setup, together with a "Reverse PageRank" scoring policy. Finally, the forwarding model and scoring policy have been applied to a real short message record dataset from some telecom operator. By some exploratory data analysis of the dataset, parameters of the forwarding model are determined. Experimental results show that the model and the scoring policy are effective in finding out seed users. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Argentine politics from 1955 to 1966 was characterized by the conflict between the Peronists and the anti-Peronists. While each camp could veto the other’s project, neither could advance their own agenda. In his canonical interpretation, O’Donnell (Modernization and Bureaucratic-Authoritarianism. Berkeley, CA: Institute of International Studies, University of California, 1973) concluded that party democracy during this era was tantamount to an ‘impossible game.’ While we recognize the significance of O’Donnell’s analysis, we believe that it presents a number of problems. To address its main shortcomings we consider a spatial model that emphasizes the importance of voters’ judgments about the characteristics of party leaders. We recover the positions of Argentine parties using a mixed logit stochastic model and an original dataset of recorded votes in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies during this era. Our results suggest that the electoral logic forced the Peronist party to adopt relatively radical positions away from the center in order to maximize its support. In turn, non-Peronist parties had little incentive to seek the support of moderate, and thus ‘unrepresented,’ Peronist voters by locating themselves at the electoral mean. In particular, valence differences associated with Peronism prevented larger parties from converging toward the center. We thus conjecture that the rules of the impossible game were a constraint imposed by the populace on Argentine political elites rather than a choice made by the latter behind the people’s back. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={Context Hunting transactions can be considered a composite good that includes various attributes or characteristics. Obtaining information regarding the utility derived from the different characteristics of the hunter's bag might help elucidate the purchasing behaviour of hunters. This behaviour is, in turn, an important aspect to be considered by land managers in adaptive hunting management. Aims The present study attempts to identify the values given by hunters to species, landscape and management in the pricing of the hunter's bag. Our analysis is focused on the hunting bag characteristics and adds to previous research the joint consideration of the amount and quality (sex, age classes and trophy) of various species in the hunter's bag. Methods We use a dataset of 740 forest hunting estates at Andalucía (1 162 405ha in the south of Spain) with an important mixed-species bag composition and where 225 game-hunting marketed transactions were declared by the hunting managers, including 13 541 hunting journeys. Hedonic-price analysis and mixed-effect models are used. Key results Our results showed that the composition of the harvested species (quantity and trophy of different species, sex and age classes), the activities related to harvesting and organisation of hunting events and landscape in hunting areas are relevant attributes in big-game market transactions. In small-game market transactions, species and landscape are the primary significant variables found. The latter variable plays a more important role in small game than in big game. Conclusions These findings indicated that hunting market values include, in addition to hunters' recreational experience, ecological and management aspects with a broader social scope. Implications A further discussion regarding the possible conflict among hunter preferences, long-term game-management decisions and ecological goals is also provided. © CSIRO 2015.},

If computers could recognize these emotional inputs, the interaction between human and computers will bemore natural. Currently, video game is one of the applications that use facial expression detection to increase natural interaction. Kinect is motion sensor for game controller that can track the detected face using Active Appearance Model (AAM). AAM is the method that adjusts shape and texture model in a new face, when there is variation of shape and texture comparing to the training result. The aim of this research is to detect facial expression by observing the change of key features in AAM using Fuzzy Logic. Fuzzy Logic is used to determine the current emotions based on prior knowledge derived from Facial Action Coding System (FACS). The experimental results on user-generated dataset show that: (i) FACS does not provide any information about the degree of muscle activation, thus the degree of the key features have to infer from specific dataset, (ii) detection accuracy of emotions depend on the kind of emotion itself. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Coalitional Resource Games (CRGs) are a natural and formal framework in which agents wish to form coalitions to pool their scarce resources in order to achieve a set of goals that satisfy all members of a coalition. Thus far, many computational questions surrounding CRGs have been studied, but to our knowledge, a number of natural decision problems in CRGs have not been solved. Therefore, in this paper we investigate the possibility of using binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) as a stochastic search process to search for Maximal Successful Coalition (MAXSC) in CRGs, which is a DP-complete problem. For this purpose, we develop a one-dimensional binary encoding scheme, propose strategies for encoding repair to ensure that each encoding in every iteration process is approximately valid and logicallsy consistent, and discuss some key properties of repair strategies. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithms, we compare them with the only other algorithm available in the literature for identifying MAXSC (due to Shrot, Aumann, and Kraus). The result shows that our algorithms are significantly faster especially for large-scale datasets. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={A standing conversational group (also known as F-formation) occurs when two or more people sustain a social interaction, such as chatting at a cocktail party. Detecting such interactions in images or videos is of fundamental importance in many contexts, like surveillance, social signal processing, social robotics or activity classification. This paper presents an approach to this problem by modeling the sociopsychological concept of an F-formation and the biological constraints of social attention. Essentially, an F-formation defines some constraints on how subjects have to be mutually located and oriented while the biological constraints defines the plausible zone in which persons can interact. We develop a game-theoretic framework embedding these constraints, which is supported by a statistical modeling of the uncertainty associated with the position and orientation of people. First, we use a novel representation of the affinity between pairs of people expressed as a distance between distributions over the most plausible oriented region of attention.Additionally, we integrate temporal information over multiple frames to smooth noisy head orientation and pose estimates, solve ambiguous situations and establish a more precise social context. We do this in a principled way by using recent notions from multi-payoff evolutionary game theory. Experiments on several benchmark datasets consistently show the superiority of the proposed approach over state of the art and its robustness under severe noise conditions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Hunting activities can affect game species in several ways; however, indirect effects of hunting on non-game species have received less attention than direct effects on game species, even though such potential effects could be crucial in some situations. There is ongoing concern that the critically endangered Florida panther Puma concolor coryi may be influenced by hunting activity, in terms of changes in panther resource selection and distribution. Nonetheless, understanding the potential effects of hunting activity on the resource selection of this wide-ranging species has proven difficult, because of the relatively fine-scale nature of variation in hunting activity and potentially confounding variables regarding intra-annual variation in hunting activity and hydrology. Here, we leverage hierarchical Bayesian models (conditional mixed logit models) and new data sources to assess the effects of hunting activity at a daily temporal scale via the use of off-road recreation vehicles (ORVs) on variation in resource selection and distribution of panthers, and we contrast these potential effects to variation in standing ground water, an alternative factor hypothesized to drive variation in panther resource selection. Across a 14-year dataset spanning 110 radio-telemetered panthers and over 30000 panther locations, we found that heightened ORV use by hunters has a small, but statistically significant effect on panther resource selection, but no effect on panther distribution near trails. In contrast, intra-annual variation in standing ground water generally had stronger and consistent effects on resource selection and on distribution of panthers near recreational trails. Our results provide slightly different conclusions than earlier results on this topic, which are likely driven by our use of more data on panthers, information on hydrology, more quantitative information on hunter activity in this region, and the scale of our analysis. © 2014 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={This paper introduces the integration of the face emotion recognition part and the voice emotion recognition part of our FILTWAM framework that uses webcams and microphones. This framework enables real-time multimodal emotion recognition of learners during game-based learning for triggering feedback towards improved learning. The main goal of this study is to validate the integration of webcam and microphone data for a real-time and adequate interpretation of facial and vocal expressions into emotional states where the software modules are calibrated with end users. This integration aims to improve timely and relevant feedback, which is expected to increase learners’ awareness of their own behavior. Twelve test persons received the same computer-based tasks in which they were requested to mimic specific facial and vocal expressions. Each test person mimicked 80 emotions, which led to a dataset of 960 emotions. All sessions were recorded on video. An overall accuracy of Kappa value based on the requested emotions, expert opinions, and the recognized emotions is 0.61, of the face emotion recognition software is 0.76, and of the voice emotion recognition software is 0.58. A multimodal fusion between the software modules can increase the accuracy to 78 %. In contrast with existing software our software modules allow real-time, continuously and unobtrusively monitoring of learners’ face expressions and voice intonations and convert these into emotional states. This inclusion of learner’s emotional states paves the way for more effective, efficient and enjoyable game-based learning. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Content-based 3D object retrieval has wide applications in various domains, ranging from virtual reality to computer aided design and entertainment. With the rapid development of digitizing technologies, different views of 3D objects are captured, which requires for effective and efficient view-based 3D object retrieval (V3DOR) techniques. As each object is represented by a set of multiple views, V3DOR becomes a group matching problem. Most of state-of-the-art V3DOR methods use one single feature to describe a 3D object, which is often insufficient. In this paper, we propose a feature fusion method via multi-modal graph learning for view-based 3D object retrieval. Firstly, different visual features, including 2D Zernike moments, 2D Fourier descriptor and 2D Krawtchouk moments, are extracted to describe each view of a 3D object. Then the Hausdorff distance is computed to measure the similarity between two 3D objects with multiple views.

abstract={A variety of advanced statistics are used to evaluate player actions in the National Hockey League, but they fail to account for the context in which an action occurs or to look ahead to the long-term effects of an action. We apply the Markov Game formalism to develop a novel approach to valuing player actions in ice hockey that incorporates context and lookahead. Dynamic programming is used to learn Q-functions that quantify the impact of actions on goal scoring resp. penalties. Learning is based on a massive dataset that contains over 2.8M events in the National Hockey League. The impact of player actions is found to vary widely depending on the context, with possible positive and negative effects for the same action. We show that lookahead makes a substantial difference to the action impact scores. Players are ranked according to the aggregate impact of their actions. We compare this impact ranking with previous player metrics, such as plus-minus, total points, and salary.},

abstract={Mastering the game of Go has remained a longstanding challenge to the field of AI. Modern computer Go programs rely on processing millions of possible future positions to play well, but intuitively a stronger and more 'humanlike' way to play the game would be to rely on pattern recognition rather than brute force computation. Following this sentiment, we train deep convolutional neural networks to play Go by training them to predict the moves made by expert Go players. To solve this problem we introduce a number of novel techniques, including a method of tying weights in the network to 'hard code' symmetries that are expected to exist in the target function, and demonstrate in an ablation study they considerably improve performance. Our final networks are able to achieve move prediction accuracies of 41.1% and 44.4% on two different Go datasets, surpassing previous state of the art on this task by significant margins. Additionally, while previous move prediction systems have not yielded strong Go playing programs, we show that the networks trained in this work acquired high levels of skill. Our convolutional neural networks can consistently defeat the well known Go program GNU Go and win some games against state of the art Go playing program Fuego while using a fraction of the play time. © Copyright 2015 by International Machine Learning Society (IMLS).

abstract={Online user-generated reviews provide consumers with abundant information, which influences their shopping decisions on a variety of products from daily consumption to entertainment. Due to the sheer size of the reviews, users are prevented from a clear picture of products. In fact, it is not easy for them to go through all reviews for each item. Existing solutions to information overload in ecommerce sites include estimating the quality of reviews and summarizing the opinions from the reviews. However, review ranking based on review quality may lead to information redundancy while review summarization fails to provide the context of reviews, resulting in poor readability. To this end, the paper aims at implementing an effective review selection method. We design two opinion extraction algorithms, which are dictionary and rule-based, and LDA-based respectively, to represent each review. A greedy approach is proposed to select a small set of high quality reviews for each product, and to maximize both the attribute coverage and opinion diversity. A set of experimental results on real datasets show that the proposed method is effective, and for the two opinion extraction algorithms, the dictionary and rule-based algorithm performs better than the LDA-based algorithm in solving review selection problem. ©, 2015, Science Press.

abstract={Numerous archives of entertainment soundtracks and other recordings such as environmental noise samples have imposed a big data challenge in audio related industries. This necessitates the use of machine audition and retrieval tools to extract semantic information for various applications. Speech recognition, environmental noise classification and music information retrieval tools haven been developed in the past for specific purposes. Combined use of these tools to process arbitrary sound recordings remains challenging: overlap of diverse sources mitigates the classification, resulting in poor recognition and/or missing content. Following a review of a universal framework for arbitrary soundtrack information mining proposed by the authors, a new solution to the overlapped sound sources has been developed in this paper by iterative signal cleaning techniques. The system classifies the arbitrary audio signals into music, speech, ambient sounds and silence, allowing overlap. Validation tests have shown that the new techniques can reduce or eliminate information losses in machine audition, hence improving the usability of machine audition in processing real-world audio archives. This paper will also discuss the dataset and principles, present the validation results and discuss potential applications.},

abstract={The exponential and rapid growth of the E-commerce based both on the new opportunities offered by the Internet, and on the spread of the use of debit or credit cards in the online purchases, has strongly increased the number of frauds, causing large economic losses to the involved businesses. The design of effective strategies able to face this problem is however particularly challenging, due to several factors, such as the heterogeneity and the non-stationary distribution of the data stream, as well as the presence of an imbalanced class distribution. To complicate the problem, there is the scarcity of public datasets for confidentiality issues, which does not allow researchers to verify the new strategies in many data contexts. Differently from the canonical stateof- the-art strategies, instead of defining a unique model based on the past transactions of the users, we follow a Divide and Conquer strategy, by defining multiple models (user behavioral patterns), which we exploit to evaluate a new transaction, in order to detect potential attempts of fraud. We can act on some parameters of this process, in order to adapt the models sensitivity to the operating environment. Considering that our models do not need to be trained with both the past legitimate and fraudulent transactions of a user, since they use only the legitimate ones, we can operate in a proactive manner, by detecting fraudulent transactions that have never occurred in the past. Such a way to proceed also overcomes the data imbalance problem that afflicts the machine learning approaches. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed by comparing it with one of the most performant approaches at the state of the art as Random Forests, using a real-world credit card. © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

abstract={One of the difficulties in automated recognition of human activities is classifying a video into a specific action class by selecting among a large number of human actions. Technology for understanding complex and varied human actions is necessary for automated surveillance, sports training, computer games, and human-robot interactions. The difficulty of classification comes from a dearth of datasets of human actions that are manually categorized and suitable for use as training data for designing action classifiers. A marker-based motion capture system enables precise measurement of human actions for the purpose of analysis. This type of capture system has several drawbacks, however; in particular, marker-based systems are expensive, intrusive, and complex to use. Despite this, the intensive use of a motion capture system can provide large datasets of human actions, and the datasets can be used to facilitate handling the variety of actions to be classified. Large datasets of human actions measured by motion capture systems are expected to be suitable for use in classifying video segments into the correct human action category, selecting from among a large number of action categories, and for inferring human postures from video. This paper proposes a new concept for a database of human whole body actions and an application to understanding human actions from video. The database contains action configurations, such as positions of body parts, pose descriptors from silhouette images, a stochastic model encoding each sequence of the pose descriptors, and a regression model for predicting the configuration from the pose descriptor. The action configurations are recorded in advance of use by measuring many human actions with a marker-based motion capture system, and silhouette images are created from these configurations. We tested the action database on action classification tasks and human body posture inference tasks. The experimental results show that the action database is suitable for use in both action classification and posture inference. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Activity recognition of multi-individuals (ARMI) within a group, which is essential to practical human-centered robotics applications such as childhood education, is a particularly challenging and previously not well studied problem. We present a novel adaptive human-centered (AdHuC) representation based on local spatio-temporal features (LST) to address ARMI in a sequence of 3D point clouds. Our human-centered detector constructs affiliation regions to associate LST features with humans by mining depth data and using a cascade of rejectors to localize humans in 3D space. Then, features are detected within each affiliation region, which avoids extracting irrelevant features from dynamic background clutter and addresses moving cameras on mobile robots. Our feature descriptor is able to adapt its support region to linear perspective view variations and encode multi-channel information (i.e., color and depth) to construct the final representation. Empirical studies validate that the AdHuC representation obtains promising performance on ARMI using a Meka humanoid robot to play multi-people Simon Says games. Experiments on benchmark datasets further demonstrate that our adaptive human-centered representation outperforms previous approaches for activity recognition from color-depth data. © 2015 IEEE.},

Receiver-operating characteristic curves applied in a training dataset (60%) extracted robust thresholds of low-risk gambling across 4 nonexclusive definitions of gambling problems (1 + to 4 + Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders-Fifth Edition [DSM-5] Composite International Diagnostic Interview [CIDI] symptoms), different indicators of gambling involvement (across all game types; form-specific) and different timeframes (lifetime; last year). Logistic regressions applied in a test dataset (40%) to cross-validate the heuristics of probable low-risk gambling incorporated confounding covariates (age, gender, education, migration, and unemployment) and confirmed the strong concurrent validity of the thresholds. Moreover, it was possible to establish robust form-specific thresholds of low-risk gambling (only for gaming machines and poker). Possible implications for early detection of problem gamblers in offline or online environments are discussed. Results substantiate international knowledge about problem gambling prevention and contribute to a German discussion about empirically based guidelines of low-risk gambling. © 2015 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={This chapter considers the usefulness and validity of public inquiries as a source of data and preliminary interpretation for case study research. Using two contrasting examples - the Bristol Inquiry into excess deaths in a children's cardiac surgery unit and the Woolf Inquiry into a breakdown of governance at the London School of Economics (LSE) - I show how academics can draw fruitfully on, and develop further analysis from, the raw datasets, published summaries and formal judgements of public inquiries. Academic analysis of public inquiries can take two broad forms, corresponding to the two main approaches to individual case study defined by Stake: instrumental (selecting the public inquiry on the basis of predefined theoretical features and using the material to develop and test theoretical propositions) and intrinsic (selecting the public inquiry on the basis of the particular topic addressed and using the material to explore questions about what was going on and why). The advantages of a public inquiry as a data source for case study research typically include a clear and uncontested focus of inquiry; the breadth and richness of the dataset collected; the exceptional level of support available for the tasks of transcribing, indexing, collating, summarising and so on; and the expert interpretations and insights of the inquiry's chair (with which the researcher may or may not agree). A significant disadvantage is that whilst the dataset collected for a public inquiry is typically 'rich', it has usually been collected under far from ideal research conditions. Hence, while public inquiries provide a potentially rich resource for researchers, those who seek to use public inquiry data for research must justify their choice on both ethical and scientific grounds.

abstract={Online athlete-generated content in social media has high potential to become the information source for both team managers and coaches to discern players' mood status and shaky performance before games. In the existing literature, either in psychology or sport analytics, there is a stream of research that investigated the relationship between athletes' mood and the individual sport performance, however, few of them discussed the causality from the social media perspective. In this study, we look deep into the Athlete-generated content (AGC) and aim to provide a more comprehensive framework to sport operators that incorporates players' social media content into their administrative decision-making process. We obtained a unique and extensive dataset of AGC for active NBA players (in the 2012-13 season) from Twitter and apply sentiment analysis technique to measure the general mood polarity of a player. The general mood was then incorporated into econometrics models to examine its effect on players' individual game performance. The results suggest that the mood of NBA player has significant effect on driving sport performance. This paper explores the possibility of using social media data to measure athletes' mood and predicting the sport performance. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The Duckworth-Lewis method is a mathematical formulation used to set a target score for cricket matches interrupted by inclement weather. The Duckworth-Lewis (D/L) method is based on a simple model involving a two factor relationship giving the number of runs which can be scored in the remainder of innings as a function of the number of overs remaining and the number of wickets that have fallen. We will list out all the flaws of the D/L Method and aptly illustrate those using WEKA tools. These tools are mainly used to deal with different predicators that aspect different aspects of the games like pitch degradation, net run-rate, and toss. WEKA tools are applied on the sample dataset of matches which were affected my D/L and their scores were re-evaluated based on this formula. WEKA tools have tried to capture different aspects of the game that would be instrumental in deciding the outcome. As a result we have observed that D/L method has some limitations and is biased towards the team batting 1 st and the team winning the toss. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Real-time deformable scene understanding is a challenging task. In this paper, we address this problem by using Conditional random fields (CRFs) framework and perceptual shape salience occupancy patterns. CRF is a powerful probabilistic model that has been widely used for labelling image segments. It is particularly well-suited to modelling local interactions and global consistency among bottom-up regions (e.g. super pixels). However, its capacity could be limited if the underlying feature potentials are not well reflecting the scene properties. We propose a depth shape-based CRF model for deformable surface (sand in our case) labelling by utilizing expressive novel shape salience occupancy patterns (SOP). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method on recorded video datasets. While our work has concentrated on sand surface labelling, the approach can be applied to other surface materials (e.g. snow, mud), and extended to non-planar surfaces as well (e.g. sculpting blocks). © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Our goal is to deploy a high-accuracy system starting with zero training examples. We consider an on-the-job setting, where as inputs arrive, we use real-time crowdsourcing to resolve uncertainty where needed and output our prediction when confident. As the model improves over time, the reliance on crowdsourcing queries decreases. We cast our setting as a stochastic game based on Bayesian decision theory, which allows us to balance latency, cost, and accuracy objectives in a principled way. Computing the optimal policy is intractable, so we develop an approximation based on Monte Carlo Tree Search. We tested our approach on three datasets-named-entity recognition, sentiment classification, and image classification. On the NER task we obtained more than an order of magnitude reduction in cost compared to full human annotation, while boosting performance relative to the expert provided labels. We also achieve a 8% F1 improvement over having a single human label the whole set, and a 28% F1 improvement over online learning.},

Under our proposed activity recognition framework, the required procedure includes: detecting human silhouettes from the image sequence, we remove noisy effects from background and track human silhouettes using temporal continuity constraints of human motion information for each activity, extracting the shape and motion features to identify richer motion information and then these features are clustered and fed into Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to train, model and recognize human activities based on transition and emission probabilities values.

abstract={DNA-binding proteins are involved and play a crucial role in a lot of important biological processes. Hence, the identification of the DNA-binding proteins is a challenging and significant problem. In order to reveal the intrinsic information correlated to DNA-binding, nine classes of candidate features based on different mathematical fields are applied to construct the prediction model with random forest. They are fractal dimension, conjoint triad feature, Hilbert-Huang Transformation, amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, chaos game representation, and the corresponding information entropies. These mathematical expressions are evaluated with 5-fold cross validation test. The results of numerical simulations show that the mathematical features consisted of amino acid composition, fractal dimension and information entropies of amino acid and chaos game representation achieve the best performance. Its accuracy is 0.8157, and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) achieves 0.5968 on the benchmark dataset from DNA-Prot. By analyzing the components of top combination of the nine candidate features, the concepts of fractal dimension and information entropy are the effective and vital features, which can provide complementary sequence-order information on the basis of amino acid composition. © 2015-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={In this demonstration we re-visit the problem of finding an optimal route from location A to B. Currently, navigation systems compute shortest, fastest, most economic routes or any combination thereof. More often than not users want to consider “soft” qualitative metrics such as popularity, scenic value, and general appeal of a route. Routing algorithms have not (yet) been able to appreciate, measure, and evaluate such qualitative measures. Given the emergence of user-generated content, data exists that records user preference. This work exploits usergenerated data, including image data, text data and trajectory data, to estimate the attractiveness of parts of the spatial network in relation to a particular user. We enrich the spatial network dataset by quantitative scores reflecting qualitative attractiveness. These scores are derived from a user-specific self-assessment (“On vacation I am interested in: family entertainment, cultural activities, exotic food”) and the selection of a respective subset of existing POIs. Using the enriched network, our demonstrator allows to perform a bicriterion optimal path search, which optimizes both travel time as well as the attractiveness of the route. Users will be able to choose from a whole skyline of alternative routes based on their preference. A chosen route will also be illustrated using user-generated data, such as images, textual narrative, and trajectories, i.e., data that showcase attractiveness and hopefully lead to a perfect trip. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={With the revolution of mobile devices and their applications, significant improvements have been witnessed over years to support new features in addition to normal phone communication including web browsing, social networking and entertainment, mobile payment, medical and personal records, e-learning, and rich connectivity to multiple networks. As mobile devices continue to evolve, the volume of hacking activities targeting them also increases drastically. Receiving short message spam is one of the common vectors for security breaches. Besides wasting resources and being annoying to end-users, it can be used for phishing attacks and as a vehicle for other malware types such as worms, backdoors, and key loggers. The next generation of mobile technologies has more emphasis on security-related issues to protect confidentiality, integrity and availability. This paper explores a number of content-based feature sets to enhance the mobile phone text messaging services in filtering unwanted messages (a.k.a. spam). Moreover, it develops a more effective spam filtering model using a combination of most relevant features and by fusing decisions of two machine learning algorithms with the Dendritic Cell Algorithm (DCA). The performance has been evaluated empirically on two SMS spam datasets. The results showed that significant improvements can be achieved in the overall accuracy, recall and precision of spam and legitimate messages due to the application of the proposed DCA-based model. © 2015 The Authors.

abstract={Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are become increasingly more available at reduced costs and are being incorporated into immersive virtual environments and video games for serious applications. Most research in BCIs focused on signal processing techniques and has neglected the interaction aspect of BCIs. This has created an imbalance between BCI classification performance and online control quality of the BCI interaction. This results in user fatigue and loss of interest over time. In the health domain, BCIs provide a new way to overcome motor-related disabilities, promoting functional and structural plasticity in the brain. In order to exploit the advantages of BCIs in neurorehabilitation we need to maximize not only the classification performance of such systems but also engagement and the sense of competence of the user. Therefore, we argue that the primary goal should not be for users to be trained to successfully use a BCI system but to adapt the BCI interaction to each user in order to maximize the level of control on their actions, whatever their performance level is. To achieve this, we developed the Adaptive Performance Engine (APE) and tested with data from 20 naïve BCI users. APE can provide user specific performance improvements up to approx. 20% and we compare it with previous methods. Finally, we contribute with an open motor-imagery datasets with 2400 trials from naïve users. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={In this paper, we propose deep transfer learning for classification of Gaussian networks with time-delayed regulations. To ensure robust signaling, most real world problems from related domains have inherent alternate pathways that can be learned incrementally from a stable form of the baseline. In this paper, we leverage on this characteristic to address the challenges of complexity and scalability. The key idea is to learn high dimensional network motifs from low dimensional forms through a process of transfer learning. In contrast to previous work, we facilitate positive transfer by introducing a triangular inequality constraint, which provides a measure for the feasibility of mapping between different motif manifolds. Network motifs from different classes of Gaussian networks are used collectively to pre-train a deep neural network governed by a Lyapunov stability condition. The proposed framework is validated on time series data sampled from synthetic Gaussian networks and applied to a real world dataset for the classification of basketball games based on skill level. We observe an improvement in the range of [15-25]% in accuracy and a saving in the range of [25-600]% in computational cost on synthetic as well as realistic networks with time-delays when compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, new insights into meaningful offensive formations in the Basketball games can be derived from the deep network. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A method for detecting falls in the homes of older adults using the Microsoft Kinect and a two-stage fall detection system is presented. The first stage of the detection system characterizes a person's vertical state in individual depth image frames, and then segments on ground events from the vertical state time series obtained by tracking the person over time. The second stage uses an ensemble of decision trees to compute a confidence that a fall preceded on a ground event. Evaluation was conducted in the actual homes of older adults, using a combined nine years of continuous data collected in 13 apartments. The dataset includes 454 falls, 445 falls performed by trained stunt actors and nine naturally occurring resident falls. The extensive data collection allows for characterization of system performance under real-world conditions to a degree that has not been shown in other studies. Cross validation results are included for standing, sitting, and lying down positions, near (within 4 m) versus far fall locations, and occluded versus not occluded fallers. The method is compared against five state-of-the-art fall detection algorithms and significantly better results are achieved. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Music is referred to as language of emotions. Music induces emotion in the brain. These emotions are subject not only types of music, but also the sensitivity of the person subjected to music. Dissimilar cases of songs as relax, patriotism, happiness, romantic or sadness will induce different types of brain activities generating different EEG signals. EEG signal is applied to measure electrical activity of the brain. These EEG signal contain precious information of the different moods of subject. In this work, we proposed a mood recognition system using EEG signal of Song Induced activity. The main purpose is to analyze alpha rhythmof EEG signal related to the left hemisphere, and right hemisphere regions of the brain. We have selected 10 male subjects in the age group of 20–25. The electrodes placed on the scalp of the subject as per the International 10–20 standard. Each test was conducted for 25 min, with eye closed and each subject was asked to concentrate on the given tasks. In this study, we have created EEG dataset containing data offive mental tasks of ten different subjects. We determine the alpha rhythms in the left hemisphere are more predominant over the right hemisphere for emotions. Thuswe conclude that the left region of the brain gives more response to the emotions rather than the right region. Here we reduce the EEG database from brain region to left hemisphere. Further we reduce it to single electrode as F7 which reside in left region. The database generated in our study may be used to interface the brain with computer to mood recognition system. This will have wide varieties of applications in the future. For example, the entertainment industries may use it for composition of songs as per their effect on the brain. This study also shows that alpha power frequency carries useful information related to mood recognition. These features are separated using Linear Discriminate Analysis. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Sport betting has become one of the most profitable business around the world. This business generates millions of dollars every year. One of the most influenced games is Baseball. Baseball has suffered an important change after the introduction of statistical methods to tune up the team strategy. This effect, called Moneyball, started in 2002 when the team Oaklans Atletics began to choose players according to their statistics. After this successful approach, several teams decided to continue with this strategy, generating strong statistical teams. The statistical information about players and matches have acquired highly importance, creating different datasets, such as Retrosheet which collects detailed information about players, teams and matches since 1956 until today. This work pretends to generate a forecasting model for Baseball focused on the result prediction of new matches using statistical previous information. We combine time-series and clustering algorithms to generate a model which learns about the teams and matches evolution and tries to predict the final results. Even whether this model is not complete accurated, it becomes a good starting point for future models. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

The tool allows the researchers to quickly build these visualizations and include development and stope geometry, geologic structures, and other spatially-related data. Additionally, the software displays current microseismic events extracted at runtime. Users can walk through the mine from a 1st person perspective and use translucency adjustments to see features beyond the floor, back, and ribs. The software also provides a 'fly' mode to inspect the exterior of the workings and datasets from any perspective. Because the Unity development environment supports multiplatform deployment, the authors were able to rapidly create variations of the visualization that take advantage of different display and interaction technologies. To date, the software has been deployed via standard desktop-executable, embedded web-browser, Oculus Rift VR headset, and fully immersive multi-screen virtual reality simulators. Future versions of the software will pull all data in a similar manner to allow the end user to rebuild the visualization on demand with the most up-to-date information across all data types.

Ostensibly military in nature, the blockade prevented not only armaments but also food and fertilizers from entering Germany. The impact of that blockade on civilian populations has been debated ever since. Germans protested that the Allies had wielded hunger as a weapon against women and children with devastating results, a claim that was hotly denied by the Allies. The impact of what the Germans termed the Hungerblockade on childhood nutrition can now be assessed using a newly discovered dataset based on heights and weights of nearly 600,000 German schoolchildren measured between 1914 and 1924. Statistical analysis reveals a grim truth: German children suffered severe malnutrition due to the blockade. Social class impacted risk of deprivation, with working-class children suffering the most. Surprisingly, they were the quickest to recover after the war. Their rescue was fuelled by massive food aid organized by the former enemies of Germany, and delivered cooperatively with both government and civil society. The ability of former belligerents to work together after an exceptionally bitter war to feed impoverished children may hold hope for the future. © Economic History Society 2014.},

abstract={In addition to identifying the content within a single image, relating images and generating related images are critical tasks for image understanding. Recently, deep convolutional networks have yielded breakthroughs in predicting image labels, annotations and captions, but have only just begun to be used for generating high-quality images. In this paper we develop a novel deep network trained end-to-end to perform visual analogy making, which is the task of transforming a query image according to an example pair of related images. Solving this problem requires both accurately recognizing a visual relationship and generating a transformed query image accordingly. Inspired by recent advances in language modeling, we propose to solve visual analogies by learning to map images to a neural embedding in which analogical reasoning is simple, such as by vector subtraction and addition. In experiments, our model effectively models visual analogies on several datasets: 2D shapes, animated video game sprites, and 3D car models.},

abstract={Over the past three decades multilateral financial aid has become an important institutional arrangement enabling environmental cooperation between developed and developing countries. However, previous research suggests that financial institutions are largely ineffective in achieving environmental goals. I show that financial assistance can be successful in increasing recipients’ contributions to environmental programs, thereby promoting environmental protection. This positive impact of aid, I argue, should be attributed to the effects of donor-recipient interactions that can alter incentives of recipient governments and induce their cooperation rather than to capacity building through inflows of aid. I study environmental assistance by first developing a game-theoretic model of strategic interaction between the donor and aid recipients. To avoid a common methodological problem of misspecification and to unify theory with empirical testing, I then derive a strategic statistical model and conduct empirical tests using a new dataset on projects financed by the Global Environment Facility. © The Author(s) 2014},

abstract={This paper introduces a novel approach for pairwise preference learning through a combination of an evolutionary method and random forest. Grammatical evolution is used to describe the structure of the trees in the Random Forest (RF) and to handle the process of evolution. Evolved random forests are evaluated based on their efficiency in predicting reported preferences. The combination of these two efficient methods for evolution and modelling yields a powerful technique for learning pairwise preferences. To test the proposed methodology and compare it to other methods in the literature, a dataset of 1560 sessions with detail information about user behaviour and their self-reported preferences while interacting with a game is used for training and evaluation. The method demonstrates ability to construct accurate models of user experience from preferences, behavioural and context data. The results obtained for predicting pairwise self-reports of users for the three emotional states engagement, frustration and challenge show very promising results that are comparable and in some cases superior to those obtained from state-of-the-art methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Marketers in the modern times are increasingly viewing globalization of the sports market as a huge opportunity to enter unchartered territories by riding on the popularity of a game. The enduring motivation of the sports consumers to connect with their favourite sport comes with an advantage for marketers who can create stronger product/brand associations with the sport. Researches establishing the relationship between the sports fanship and related consumption reinforce the belief. The present study in an exploratory attempt to understand the impact of sports enthusiasm and related consumption in the context of an emerging market uses a mixed method approach with qualitative focus group discussion and a quantitative analysis of the dataset of 226 actual buyers of football ancillary from the National Capital Region of Delhi in India. Consequently, a factor analysis of the key motivators for football ancillaries buying behaviour identified three drivers; namely, social approval, individual passion and utilitarian motivation, for the urban Indian sports enthusiasts. Further, segment-wise product decisions and purchase decisions were reported along with the relative importance of purchasing football ancillaries. The significant influence of football connectedness among urban Indian consumers despite cricket being the most followed sport added a whole new dimension to the study of sports market consumers in the emerging Indian market giving directions for future research and marketing practices in the domain. © 2015, © 2015 IMI.},

abstract={The challenging problem that we explore in this paper is to precisely estimate the number of vehicles in an image of a traffic congestion situation. We start introducing TRANCOS, a novel database for extremely overlapping vehicle counting. It provides more than 1200 images where the number of vehicles and their locations have been annotated. We establish a clear experimental setup which will let others evaluate their own vehicle counting approaches. We also propose a novel evaluation metric, the Grid Average Mean absolute Error (GAME), which overcomes the limitations of previously proposed metrics for object counting. Finally, we perform an experimental validation, using the proposed TRANCOS dataset, for two types of vehicle counting strategies: counting by detection; and counting by regression. Our results show that counting by regression strategies are more precise localizing and estimating the number of vehicles.

An information-theory model is proposed firstly, and then the information entropy is calculated for each data patch, which is taken as a preestimation of the computational amount of ray sampling. According to their computational amounts, the data patches are distributed to the processing cores balancedly, and accordingly load imbalance in parallel rendering is decreased. Compared with the existing methods such as random assignment and ray estimation, the proposed entropy-based load balancing scheme can achieve a rendering speedup ratio of 1.23∼2.84. It is the best choice in interactive volume rendering due to its speedup performance and view independence.},

Moreover, all data-driven approaches for analysis and synthesis of motions are depending on motion capture data. Although multiple large motion capture data sets are freely available for research, there is no system which can provide a centralized access to all of them in an organized manner. In this paper we show that using a relational database management system (RDBMS) to store data does not only provide such a centralized access to the data, but also allows to include other sensor modalities (e.g. accelerometer data) and various semantic annotations. We present two applications for our system: A motion capture player where motions sequences can be retrieved from large datasets using SQL queries and the automatic construction of statistical models which can further be used for complex motion analysis and motions synthesis tasks. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

In the present study we analyze and discuss "what it takes to do computer programming" using phenomenography as research approach. This study is based on a large survey dataset gathered in summer outreach courses for K-12 students. The analysis resulted in 12 qualitatively different categories belonging to five separate, emergent themes: Syntax and language features, nature of programming work generally, computational thinking and problem solving, prerequisites, and auxiliary skills. We additionally reviewed whether the students' previous experience explains the categories, and observed that a mechanistic view of programming was prevailing among the inexperienced users, while experienced students more often stressed algorithmic thinking and logical reasoning. This study resembles work done by Eckerdal et al. [3], but gives a K-12 perspective to the question, "what does it takes to do programming?". Copyright © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven membrane-spanning proteins and regulate many important physiological processes, such as vision, neurotransmission, immune response and so on. GPCRs-related pathways are the targets of a large number of marketed drugs. Therefore, the design of a reliable computational model for predicting GPCRs from amino acid sequence has long been a significant biomedical problem. Chaos game representation (CGR) reveals the fractal patterns hidden in protein sequences, and then fractal dimension (FD) is an important feature of these highly irregular geometries with concise mathematical expression. Here, in order to extract important features from GPCR protein sequences, CGR algorithm, fractal dimension and amino acid composition (AAC) are employed to formulate the numerical features of protein samples. Four groups of features are considered, and each group is evaluated by support vector machine (SVM) and 10-fold cross-validation test. To test the performance of the present method, a new non-redundant dataset was built based on latest GPCRDB database. Comparing the results of numerical experiments, the group of combined features with AAC and FD gets the best result, the accuracy is 99.22% and Matthew's correlation coefficient (MCC) is 0.9845 for identifying GPCRs from non-GPCRs. Moreover, if it is classified as a GPCR, it will be further put into the second level, which will classify a GPCR into one of the five main subfamilies. At this level, the group of combined features with AAC and FD also gets best accuracy 85.73%. Finally, the proposed predictor is also compared with existing methods and shows better performances. © 2015-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Background: Mass gatherings and large sporting events, such as the Olympics, may potentially pose a risk of increased sexually transmitted infection (STI) transmission and increase burden on local STI services. The objectives of this analysis were to assess whether the STI profile of Olympic visitors differed fromthat of the local STI clinic population and to investigate what impact these visitors had on local STI services. Methods: Self-administered questionnaires (completed by 29,292 patients) were used to determine the visitor status of patients attending 20 STI clinics, between July 20, 2012, and September 16, 2012, in the host cities, London and Weymouth. Using routine surveillance data from the Genitourinary Medicine Clinic Activity Dataset version 2, Olympic visitors were compared with usual attendees (local residents and non-Olympic visitors) in terms of their demographic characteristics, services utilized, and STIs diagnosed using univariate and multivariate methods. Results: Compared with usual attendees, Olympic visitors were more likely to be heterosexual males (56.0% vs. 34.9%, P = 0.001), aged between 15 and 24 years of age (47.1% vs. 34.0%, P = 0.001), of white ethnicity (81.9% vs. 66.4%, P = 0.001), and born in Australasia, Asia, North America, or South America (18.8% vs. 12.0%, P = 0.006). Olympic visitors constituted 1% of new clinic attendances and were less likely to be diagnosed as having a new STI (adjusted odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.98; P = 0.040). Conclusions: In this first multisite study to examine the effect of Olympic visitors on local sexual health services, the 2012 Olympic Games was found to have minimal impact.

abstract={The present study developed a new algorithm based on multi-feature fusion and semantic similarity for image annotation. To study the relationship between feature distance and semantic similarity, the feature-annotation space is transformed into a distance-similarity space. Therefore, the intrinsic statistical relationship between visual and semantic information can be studied. Re-scaling is necessary to fuse multiple features. The potential multimodal properties of image features mean that traditional feature re-scaling is based on boundary values, which are sensitive to outliers. Our proposed distance re-scaling method overcomes the drawbacks of using statistical information. In the distance space, each distance vector of an image pair is treated as a sample. The anisotropic Gaussian distribution is transformed into an isotropic Gaussian with a mean of zero and standard variance. The nearest-distance images are retrieved from this space. To select features of not only low distance correlations but also a high semantic correlation, the visual and semantic relationship is studied using canonical correlation analysis. The canonical correlation coefficient of the similarity and distance is found to connect closely with the annotation score of the feature. Experiments showed that the proposed multi-feature fusion method removed the effects of scale and the correlations of feature distances, so it could represent the total distance better and find the nearest neighbors. We tested our method using the Corel5K, IAPR-TC12, ESP Game, and VOC PASCAL datasets, which showed that it outperformed existing approaches. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The spread of opinions in social networks is dependent on structural properties of the network and the individual characteristics of its nodes. To capture this dependence, several abstract models of such spread were proposed. First, we model the difference between the dynamics of opinion spread in communities with a static social network versus a dynamic social network. Here we use the theoretical model of spread of opinions called the Binary Agreement Model based on the naming game. Using this model, we study potential mechanisms for the dependencies observed in the data by matching model generated evolution of opinion with the empirically observed evolution in the data. Second, we examine the unique set of behavioral network data (based on electronic logs of dyadic contact via smartphones) collected at the University of Notre Dame. The participants are a sample of members of the entering class of freshmen in the fall of 2011 whose opinions on a wide variety of political and social issues have been regularly recorded—at the beginning and end of each semester—for the last three years. Using this data set, we measure the evolution of participants’ opinions and ascertain how much this evolution depends on the cultural traits of individuals and the structural properties of social networks that they form. Our analysis of our empirical dataset shows that ties among people who are more likely to share opinions (e.g. same race, gender, or socioeconomic class) decay at a slower rate than ties among persons who are likely to have different opinions. The analysis also indicates that the partner selection of individuals is associated sharing a (political) opinion. These results offer an assessment of the level of impact of culture and social network dynamics on the evolution of opinions in multi-cultural social networks. © 2015},

abstract={Mating with multiple partners is common across species, and understanding how individual males secure fertilization in the face of competition remains a fundamental goal of evolutionary biology. Game theory stipulates that males have a fixed budget for reproduction that can lead to a trade-off between investment in precopulatory traits such as body size, armaments, and ornaments, and postcopulatory traits such as testis size and spermatogenic efficiency. Recent theoretical and empirical studies have shown that if males can monopolize access to multiple females, they will invest disproportionately in precopulatory traits and less in postcopulatory traits. Using phylogenetically controlled comparative methods, we demonstrate that across 58 cetacean species with the most prominent sexual dimorphism in size, shape, teeth, tusks, and singing invest significantly less in relative testes mass. In support of theoretical predictions, these species tend to show evidence of male contests, suggesting there is opportunity for winners to monopolize access to multiple females. Our approach provides a robust dataset with which to make predictions about male mating strategies for the many cetacean species for which adequate behavioral observations do not exist. © 2015 The Society for the Study of Evolution.},

abstract={Availability of physical activity monitors for wheelchair users can potentially assist these individuals to track regular physical activity (PA), which in turn could lead to a healthier and more active lifestyle. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop and validate algorithms for a physical activity monitoring system (PAMS) to detect wheelchair based activities. The PAMS consists of a gyroscope based wheel rotation monitor (G-WRM) and an accelerometer device (wocket) worn on the upper arm or on the wrist. A total of 45 persons with spinal cord injury took part in the study, which was performed in a structured university-based laboratory environment, a semi-structured environment at the National Veterans Wheelchair Games, and in the participants' home environments. Participants performed at least ten PAs, other than resting, taken from a list of PAs. The classification performance for the best classifiers on the testing dataset for PAMS-Arm (G-WRM and wocket on upper arm) and PAMS-Wrist (G-WRM and wocket on wrist) was 89.26% and 88.47%, respectively. The outcomes of this study indicate that multi-modal information from the PAMS can help detect various types of wheelchair-based activities in structured laboratory, semi-structured organizational, and unstructured home environments. © 2014 IPEM.},

abstract={Recent advances in high performance computing technologies are increasing the model complexity, model resolution and the number of simulations in the climate science. Interactive exploration and analysis of these complex, multi-field climate data sets has been identified as one of the major current challenges in scientific visualization today. Without direct 3D multi-field visualization it is hard to see, for example, important correlative effects between vertical wind velocities and transport of volumetric atmosphere. Since the data have complicated 3D structures and are highly time-dependent, the visualization approach must handle this dynamic data in a highly interactive way. In this paper we propose a real-time multi-field visualization framework for earth climate simulation data. A novel visualization pipeline is presented for on-demand data processing, enabling scalable handling large-scale climate dataset. The GPU hardware accelerated multi-field visualization method in the framework allows for the interactive visual analysis of the multiple intersecting climate phenomenons. An information-theoretic based wind field analysis method is also implemented in the visualization framework to help scientist to gain deeper understanding of underlying multi-field climate data.},

abstract={More and more users are watching online videos produced by non-professional sources (e.g., gamers, teachers of online courses, witnesses of public events) by using an increasingly diverse set of devices to access the videos (e.g., smartphones, tablets, HDTV). Live streaming service providers can combine adaptive streaming technologies and cloud computing to satisfy this demand. In this paper, we study the problem of preparing live video streams for delivery using cloud computing infrastructure, e.g., how many representations to use and the corresponding parameters (resolution and bit-rate). We present an integer linear program (ILP) to maximize the average user quality of experience (QoE) and a heuristic algorithm that can scale to large number of videos and users. We also introduce two new datasets: one characterizing a popular live streaming provider (Twitch) and another characterizing the computing resources needed to transcode a video. They are used to set up realistic test scenarios. We compare the performance of the optimal ILP solution with current industry standards, showing that the latter are sub-optimal. The solution of the ILP also shows the importance of the type of video on the optimal streaming preparation. By taking advantage of this, the proposed heuristic can efficiently satisfy a time varying demand with an almost constant amount of computing resources. Copyright © 2015 ACM.},

abstract={Sports performance consists of a multiple series of strategies that tend to follow one another. Performance analysis in team sports is usually focused on primary (fundamental skill execution), secondary (scoring) and tertiary (match result) outcomes. While there is general agreement over measuring secondary and tertiary outcomes, literature does not show a unanimous agreement over a unique measure of the primary level of performance. The aim of this study was to investigate primary performance outcomes through an analysis of temporal patterns. In particular, we were interested in verifying if changes in tertiary performance outcomes may be related to changes in primary ones. We selected three soccer matches played by a top club during the Serie A league over the 2012-2013 season in which there was a change in match result between first and second half (tertiary level of performance). The methodological approach was based on observational design, supported by digital recordings and computer analysis. Data were analyzed with theme 6 beta software, which detects the temporal and sequential structure of datasets, revealing repeated patterns that may regularly or irregularly occur within a period of observation (Tpatterns). Striking differences were found comparing first and second half temporal patterns, especially when the final match outcome showed an improvement of the first half's one. Our results suggest that theme software and T-pattern enhance research opportunities by identifying a useful tool to study the link between primary and tertiary level of performance, making this an elective research and support instrument for sports analysis. © 2015: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.},

abstract={Player interaction is an inherent part of soccer and the collective use of space may be an aspect of game dynamics that merits closer study. This study investigates differences in the use of playing space between under-14 and under-16 male soccer players. Twelve matches (six per age group) were observed, coded, and recorded using the ad hoc soccer observation instrument SOFBAS (version 2). Following confirmation of the quality of the data, the datasets were analyzed by polar coordinate analysis from the perspective of genuine retrospectivity. Effective playing area (EJE) categories were chosen as the criterion, or focal, behaviors. These categories represented the location of the player on his first contact with the ball in relation to the EJE and to the location of his teammates and opposing players. Four categories were used: FF (outside-outside), FD (outside-inside), DF (inside-outside), and DD (inside-inside). The polar coordinate analysis revealed differences in the strategic use of space between the two age groups, with the older players showing a more balanced use of the areas inside and outside the EJE. The results of this study suggest that training strategies adapted to the age and abilities of players might result in more efficient and effective training sessions and learning. © 2015: Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Murcia.},

abstract={Relational diversity can be characterized by heterogeneous distributions of tie strengths in social networks and this diversity is present not only among humans, but throughout the animal world. We account for this observation by analyzing two network datasets from Facebook. We measure the strength of a tie by calculating the extent of overlap of friends between the two individuals. Based on the previous findings in human experiments, we argue that it is very unlikely that players will allocate their investments equally to their neighbors. There is a tendency that players prefer to donate more to their intimate friends. We find that if players preferentially allocate their investments to their good friends, cooperation will be promoted in PDG. We proved that the facilitation of the cooperative strategy relies mostly on the cooperative allies between best friends, resulting in the formation of cooperative clusters which are able to prevail against the defectors even when there is a large cost to cooperate. Moreover, we discover that the effect of relational diversity cannot be analyzed by adopting classical complex networks models, because neither of the artificial networks is able to produce networks with diverse distributions of tie strengths. It is of vital importance to introduce real social networks to study the influence of diverse relations especially when it comes to humans. This research proposes a brand new perspective to understand the influence of social relations on the emergence of cooperation in evolutionary prisoner's dilemma games. © 2014 Xu et al.},

abstract={"Moving to the beat" is both one of the most basic and one of the most profound means by which humans (and a few other species) interact with music. Computer algorithms that detect the precise temporal location of beats (i.e., pulses of musical "energy") in recorded music have important practical applications, such as the creation of playlists with a particular tempo for rehabilitation (e.g., rhythmic gait training), exercise (e.g., jogging), or entertainment (e.g., continuous dance mixes). Although several such algorithms return simple point estimates of an audio file's temporal structure (e.g., "average tempo", "time signature"), none has sought to quantify the temporal stability of a series of detected beats. Such a method-a "Balanced Evaluation of Auditory Temporal Stability" (BEATS)-is proposed here, and is illustrated using the Million Song Dataset (a collection of audio features and music metadata for nearly one million audio files). A publically accessible web interface is also presented, which combines the thresholdable statistics of BEATS with queryable metadata terms, fostering potential avenues of research and facilitating the creation of highly personalized music playlists for clinical or recreational applications. © 2014 Ellis et al.},

abstract={Data mining is a powerful emerging technology that helps to extract hidden information from a huge volume of historical data. This paper is concerned with finding the frequent trajectories of moving objects in spatio-temporal data by a novel method adopting the concepts of clustering and sequential pattern mining. The algorithms used logically split the trajectory span area into clusters and then apply the k-means algorithm over this clusters until the squared error minimizes. The new method applies the threshold to obtain active clusters and arranges them in descending order based on number of trajectories passing through. From these active clusters, inter cluster patterns are found by a sequential pattern mining technique. The process is repeated until all the active clusters are linked. The clusters thus linked in sequence are the frequent trajectories. A set of experiments conducted using real datasets shows that the proposed method is relatively five times better than the existing ones. A comparison is made with the results of other algorithms and their variation is analyzed by statistical methods. Further, tests of significance are conducted with ANOVA to find the efficient threshold value for the optimum plot of frequent trajectories. The results are analyzed and found to be superior than the existing ones. This approach may be of relevance in finding alternate paths in busy networks (congestion control), finding the frequent paths of migratory birds, or even to predict the next level of pattern characteristics in case of time series data with minor alterations and finding the frequent path of balls in certain games. © 2014 Periodical Offices of Chang'an University},

abstract={Multimodal datasets often feature a combination of continuous signals and a series of discrete events. For instance, when studying human behaviour it is common to annotate actions performed by the participant over several other modalities such as video recordings of the face or physiological signals. These events are nominal, not frequent and are not sampled at a continuous rate while signals are numeric and often sampled at short fixed intervals. This fundamentally different nature complicates the analysis of the relation among these modalities which is often studied after each modality has been summarised or reduced. This paper investigates a novel approach to model the relation between such modality types bypassing the need for summarising each modality independently of each other. For that purpose, we introduce a deep learning model based on convolutional neural networks that is adapted to process multiple modalities at different time resolutions we name deep multimodal fusion. Furthermore, we introduce and compare three alternative methods (convolution, training and pooling fusion) to integrate sequences of events with continuous signals within this model. We evaluate deep multimodal fusion using a game user dataset where player physiological signals are recorded in parallel with game events. Results suggest that the proposed architecture can appropriately capture multimodal information as it yields higher prediction accuracies compared to single-modality models. In addition, it appears that pooling fusion, based on a novel filter-pooling method provides the more effective fusion approach for the investigated types of data. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={The present paper introduces a learning-based optimization approach to the resource-constrained multi-project scheduling problem. Multiple projects, each with their own set of activities, need to be scheduled. The objectives dealt with here include minimization of the average project delay and total makespan. The availability of local and global resources, precedence relations between activities, and non-equal project start times have to be considered. The proposed approach relies on a simple sequence learning game played by a group of project managers. The project managers each learn their activity list locally using reinforcement learning, more specifically learning automata. Meanwhile, they learn how to choose a suitable place in the overall sequence of all activity lists. All the projects need to arrive at a unique place in this sequence. A mediator, who usually has to solve a complex optimization problem, now manages a simple dispersion game. Through the mediator, a sequence of feasible activity lists is eventually scheduled by using a serial schedule generation scheme, which is adopted from single project scheduling. It is shown that the sequence learning approach has a large positive effect on minimizing the average project delay. In fact, the combination of local reinforcement learning, the sequence learning game and a forward-backward implementation of the serial scheduler significantly improves the best known results for all the MPSPLIB datasets. In addition, several new best results were obtained for both considered objectives: minimizing the average project delay and minimizing the total makespan. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={Locating relevant biological analogies is a challenge that lies at the heart of practicing biologically inspired design. Current computer-assisted biologically inspired design tools require human-in-the-loop synthesis of biology knowledge. Either a biology expert must synthesize information into a standard form, or a designer must interpret and assess biological strategies. These approaches limit knowledge breadth and tool usefulness, respectively. The work presented in this paper applies the technique of human computation, a historically successful approach for information retrieval problems where both breadth and accuracy are required, to address a similar problem in biologically inspired design. The broad goals of this work are to distribute the knowledge synthesis step to a large number of nonexpert humans, and to capture that synthesized knowledge in a format that can support analogical reasoning between designed systems and biological systems. To that end, this paper presents a novel human computation game and accompanying information model for collecting computable descriptions of biological strategies, an assessment of the quality of these descriptions gathered from experimental data, and a brief evaluation of the game's entertainment value. Two successive prototypes of the biology phenomenon categorizer (BioP-C); a cooperative, asymmetric, online game; were each deployed in a small engineering graduate class in order to collect assertions about the biological phenomenon of cell division. Through the act of playing, students formed assertions describing key concepts within textual passages. These assertions are assessed for their correctness, and these assessments are used to identify directly measurable correctness indicators. The results show that the number of hints in a game session is negatively correlated with assertion correctness. Further, BioP-C assertions are rated as significantly more correct than randomly generated assertions in both prototype tests, demonstrating the method's potential for gathering accurate information. Tests on these two different BioP-C prototypes produce average assertion correctness assessments of 3.19 and 2.98 on a five-point Likert scale. Filtering assertions on the optimal number of game session hints within each prototype test increases these mean values to 3.64 and 3.36. The median assertion correctness scores are similarly increased from 3.00 and 3.00 in both datasets to 4.08 and 3.50. Players of the game expressed that the fundamental anonymous interactions were enjoyable, but the difficulty of the game can harm the experience. These results indicate that a human computation approach has the potential to solve the problem of low information breadth currently faced by biologically inspired design databases. © 2014 by ASME.},

(“Screen time” is time spent using an electronic device that has a screen, such as: a computer, television, game console, tablet, or cell phone.) Analysis of the data suggested that parents using empowerment parenting, closely aligned with authoritative techniques, had children with better academic performance, reduced sleep onset latency (SOL), and healthier social and emotional behaviors than children of parents who practiced traditional parenting, more closely aligned with authoritarian techniques. Further, increased family time was found to have benefits to children on par with those of empowerment parenting. © 2014, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Faunal evidence from the Fayum Neolithic is often cited in the framework of early stock keeping in Egypt. However, the data suffer from a number of problems. In the present paper, large faunal datasets from new excavations at Kom K and Kom W (4850-4250 BC) are presented. They clearly show that, despite the presence of domesticates, fish predominate in the animal bone assemblages. In this sense, there is continuity with the earlier Holocene occupation from the Fayum, starting ca. 7350 BC. Domesticated plants and animals appear first from approximately 5400 BC. The earliest possible evidence for domesticates in Egypt are the very controversial domesticated cattle from the 9th/8th millennium BC in the Nabta Playa-Bir Kiseiba area. The earliest domesticates found elsewhere in Egypt date to the 6th millennium BC. The numbers of bones are generally extremely low at this point in time and only caprines are present. From the 5th millennium BC, the numbers of sites with domesticates dramatically increase, more species are also involved and they are usually represented by significant quantities of bones. The data from the Fayum reflect this two phase development, with very limited evidence for domesticates in the 6th millennium BC and more abundant and clearer indications in the 5th millennium BC. Any modelling of early food production in Egypt suffers from poor amounts of data, bias due to differential preservation and visibility of sites and archaeological remains, and a lack of direct dates for domesticates. In general, however, the evidence for early stock keeping and accompanying archaeological features shows large regional variation and seems to be mainly dependent on local environmental conditions. The large numbers of fish at Kom K and Kom W reflect the proximity of Lake Qarun. © 2014 Linseele et al.},

abstract={Interstate wars and animal contests both involve disputed resources, restraint and giving up decisions. In both cases it seems illogical for the weaker side to persist in the conflict if it will eventually lose. In the case of animal contests analyses of the links between opponent power and contest duration have provided insights into what sources of information are available to fighting animals. I outline the theory of information use during animal contests and describe a statistical framework that has been used to distinguish between two strategies that individuals use to decide whether to persist or quit. I then apply this framework to the analysis of interstate wars. War duration increases with the power of winners and losers. These patterns provide no support for the idea that wars are settled on the basis of mutual assessment of capabilities but indicate that settlement is based on attrition. In contrast to most animal contests, war duration is as closely linked to the power of the winning side as to that of the losing side. Overall, this analysis highlights a number of similarities between animal contests and interstate war, indicating that both could be investigated using similar conceptual frameworks. © 2014 Mark Briffa.},

abstract={This paper evaluates a long sequence of zooarchaeological remains from Klissoura Cave 1 (southern Greece) within the paradigm of evolutionary ecology. The prey choice, central place foraging, and patch choice models are applied to the dataset in order to understand subsistence shifts related to local resource depression and changes in the intensity of site use from the Middle Paleolithic through Mesolithic. Major trends in prey choice indicate that Middle Paleolithic hominins tended to focus on high-ranked large game resources, while Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic occupants shifted to lower-ranked small game, fast-moving animals in particular. Overarching shifts in prey use do not correspond to environmental change, so they likely reflect human impacts on local prey populations. Reconstructions of body part profiles indicate that hunters exploited large game animals locally, possibly as they passed through the gorge or drank at a nearby stream. Occupation intensity at the site was highest at the beginning of the Aurignacian, which is reflected by an increase in material culture such as lithics and hearth features, as well as different subsistence strategies. Specifically, bone marrow processing is more important, evidenced by ungulate transport decisions that focus on marrow-rich elements, and an overall increase in marrow processing intensity. Environmental data indicate that conditions in southern Greece were particularly favorable at the beginning of the Aurignacian, which supported rich ungulate faunas and larger populations of their hominin predators in the area. In general, faunal data from Klissoura Cave 1 fit within larger trends found in the Mediterranean over the course of the Late Pleistocene, which indicate that human hunting pressures were on the rise. However, many aspects of prey use are specific to Klissoura Cave 1, reflecting unique environmental and cultural circumstances of southern Greece at various phases in the occupation of the site. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Current social networks are of extremely large-scale generating tremendous information flows at every moment. How information diffuses over social networks has attracted much attention from both industry and academics. Most of the existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on machine learning methods focusing on social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the network users' decisions, actions, and socio-economic interactions are generally ignored by most of existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks. Specifically, we derive the information diffusion dynamics in complete networks, uniform degree, and nonuniform degree networks, with the highlight of two special networks, the Erdo{double acute}s-Rényi random network and the Barabási-Albert scale-free network. We find that the dynamics of information diffusion over these three kinds of networks are scale-free and all the three dynamics are same with each other when the network scale is sufficiently large. To verify our theoretical analysis, we perform simulations for the information diffusion over synthetic networks and real-world Facebook networks. Moreover, we also conduct an experiment on a Twitter hashtags dataset, which shows that the proposed game theoretic model can well fit and predict the information diffusion over real social networks. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Animal body size is driven by habitat quality, food availability, and nutrition. Adult size can relate to birth weight, to length of the ontogenetic growth period, and/or to the rate of growth. Data requirements are high for studying these growth mechanisms, but large datasets exist for some game species. In North America, large harvest datasets exist for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), but such data are collected under a variety of conditions and are generally dismissed for ecological research beyond local population and habitat management. We contend that such data are useful for studying the ecology of white-tailed deer growth and body size when analyzed at ordinal scale. In this paper, we test the response of growth rate to food availability by fitting a logarithmic equation that estimates growth rate only to harvest data from Fort Hood, Texas, and track changes in growth rate over time. Results of this ordinal scale model are compared to previously published models that include additional parameters, such as birth weight and adult weight. It is shown that body size responds to food availability by variation in growth rate. Models that estimate multiple parameters may not work with harvest data because they are prone to error, which renders estimates from complex models too variable to detect interannual changes in growth rate that this ordinal scale model captures. This model can be applied to harvest data, from which inferences about factors that influence animal growth and body size (e.g., habitat quality and nutritional availability) can be drawn. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Sponsored search is the major business model of commercial search engines. The number of clicks on ads is a key indicator of success for both advertisers and search engines, and therefore increasing ad clicks is a goal of both of them. Many existing works stand on the view of search engines concerning how to help search engines to earn more revenue by accurately predicting ad clicks. Unlike these works, this paper aims at understanding user clicks on ads from "the view of advertisers", in order to help advertisers to improve their ad quality and therefore advertising effectiveness. To do this, a factor graph model is proposed, which considers two advertiser-controllable factors to understand user click behaviors: (1) the relevance between a query and an ad, which has been well studied in the literature, and (2) the " attractiveness" of the ad, which is a newly-proposed concept. The proposed model can be used to predict user clicks and also to mine a set of attractive words that could be leveraged to improve the quality of the ads. We have verified the effectiveness of the proposed approach using real world datasets, through quantitative evaluations and informative case studies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Analyzing the structure of social networks is of interest in a wide range of disciplines. Unfortunately, sharing social-network datasets is often restrained by privacy considerations. One way to address the privacy concern is to anonymize the data before publishing. Randomly adding or deleting edges from the social graph is one of the anonymization approaches that have been proposed in the literature. Recent studies have quantified the level of anonymity that is obtained by random perturbation by means of a posteriori belief probabilities and, by conducting experiments on small datasets, arrived at the conclusion that random perturbation cannot achieve meaningful levels of anonymity without deteriorating the graph properties. We offer a new information-theoretic perspective on the question of anonymizing a social network by means of random edge additions and deletions. We make an essential distinction between image and preimage anonymity and propose a more accurate quantification, based on entropy, of the anonymity level that is provided by the perturbed network. We explain why the entropy-based quantification, which is global, is more adequate than the previously used local quantification that was based on a posteriori belief probabilities. We also prove that the anonymity level as quantified by means of entropy is always greater than or equal to the one based on a posteriori belief probabilities. In addition, we introduce and explore the method of random sparsification, which randomly removes edges, without adding new ones. Extensive experimentation on several very large datasets shows that randomization techniques for identity obfuscation are back in the game, as they may achieve meaningful levels of anonymity while still preserving properties of the original graph. As the methods we study add and remove edges, it is natural to ask whether an adversary might use the disclosed perturbed graph structure to reconstruct, even partially, the original graph. We thus study the resilience of obfuscation by random sparsification to adversarial attacks that are based on link prediction. Given a general link prediction method, with a predefined level of prediction accuracy, we show how to quantify the level of anonymity that is guaranteed by the obfuscation. We empirically prove that even for very accurate link prediction methods, the level of anonymity guaranteed remains very close to the one before the attack. Finally, we show how the randomization method may be applied in a distributed setting, where the network data is distributed among several non-trusting sites, and explain why randomization is far more suitable for such settings than other existing approaches. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a method for robust Sign Language Recognition from RGB-D data. A Sparse Observation (SO) description is proposed to character each sign in terms of the typical hand postures. Concretely speaking, the SOs are generated by considering the typical posture fragments, where hand motions are relatively slow and hand shapes are stable. Thus the matching between two sign words is converted to measure the similarity computing between two aligned SO sequences. The alignment is formulated as a variation of Stable Marriage Problem (SMP). The classical "propose-engage" idea is extended to get the order preserving matched SO pairs. In the training stage, the multiple instances from one sign are fused to generate single SO template. In the recognition stage, SOs of each probe sign "propose" to SOs of the templates for the purpose of reasonable similarity computing. To further speed up the SO alignment, hand posture relationship map is constructed as a strong prior to generate the distinguished low-dimensional feature of SO. Moreover, to get much better performance, the motion trajectory feature is integrated. Experiments on two large datasets and an extra Chalearn Multi-modal Gesture Dataset demonstrate that our algorithm has much higher accuracy with only 1/10 time cost compared with the HMM and DTW based methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Video games are not necessarily uniform in the "lessons" they teach players. Indeed, even violent video games are not simply hotbeds of violent content. For example, the popular Call of Duty and Resident Evil series require players to behave violently in order to protect other people or computer characters. Thus, in these games, aggression is taught in simultaneity with altruism. The questions, then, arise 1) whether social learning is an appropriate explanation for long-term effects of games, and 2) whether games can only teach antisocial lessons. The first chapter of this book addresses video game effects from a long-term, holistic perspective, focusing on antisocial and prosocial outcomes, using a conveniently collected survey dataset. Moreover, this book also analyzes video games by different genres.

abstract={Video games are not necessarily uniform in the "lessons" they teach players. Indeed, even violent video games are not simply hotbeds of violent content. For example, the popular Call of Duty and Resident Evil series require players to behave violently in order to protect other people or computer characters. Thus, in these games, aggression is taught in simultaneity with altruism. The questions, then, arise 1) whether social learning is an appropriate explanation for long-term effects of games, and 2) whether games can only teach antisocial lessons. This study addresses video game effects from a long-term, holistic perspective, focusing on antisocial and prosocial outcomes, using a conveniently collected survey dataset. Moreover, this study also analyzed video games by different genres. After all, the lessons taught by a violent first-person shooter zombie game are uniquely different from the lessons taught by a family-friendly, motion-based sports video game. This study utilized a survey administered to a conveniently collected sample. Overall, the survey was completed by people living in the United States, Canada, England, Australia, and several other nations (N = 544). In order to test the hypotheses and research questions, a number of regression models were employed. Considering antisocial behaviors in general, it was found that playing video games was positively related to antisocial behaviors. Moreover, frequent gaming is negatively related to prosocial behaviors. Considering prosocial and antisocial behaviors and video games from a more individualized perspective, it was found that frequently playing sports games is related to altruism. Frequency of playing sports games was related negatively, and frequency of playing fantasy games was related positively to reclusiveness. Finally, the simulation and action/violent genres are related positively to trait hostility. © 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={How should affect be appropriately annotated and how should machine learning best be employed to map manifestations of affect to affect annotations? What is the use of ratings of affect for the study of affective computing and how should we treat them? These are the key questions this paper attempts to address by investigating the impact of dissimilar representations of annotated affect on the efficacy of affect modelling. In particular, we compare several different binary-class and pairwise preference representations for automatically learning from ratings of affect. The representations are compared and tested on three datasets: one synthetic dataset (testing 'in vitro ') and two affective datasets (testing 'in vivo'). The synthetic dataset couples a number of attributes with generated rating values. The two affective datasets contain physiological and contextual user attributes, and speech attributes, respectively; these attributes are coupled with ratings of various affective and cognitive states. The main results of the paper suggest that ratings (when used) should be naturally transformed to ordinal (ranked) representations for obtaining more reliable and generalisable models of affect. The findings of this paper have a direct impact on affect annotation and modelling research but, most importantly, challenge the traditional state-of-practice in affective computing and psychometrics at large. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In the digital age, the field of machine learning has lived up to its promise of learning from and leveraging data in diverse fields, creating knowledge and driving decisions. This book intends to detail advances in the state-of-the-art in machine learning, one of the fastest emerging fields in the industry and one of the most popular fields of research in computational sciences. The roots of machine learning methods can be traced back to both statistics and computer science. Its story continues to evolve and the future is set to be greatly influenced through ML's contributions to the human knowledge-base as well as the economic engine. Applied machine learning research enthuses the masses with applications such as video games that interact through a camera, self-driving cars, etc. At the same time, more basic machine learning research holds the potential to impact knowledge elicitation, learning, predictions, decisions, and optimizations in fields ranging from environmental/biomedical/clinical informatics on one hand to online retail and search on the other. Accordingly, the contents of this volume are geared to present a full-color palette consisting of improved optimization algorithms, novel ANN design architectures, along with customized methods for mining an environmental dataset, pattern recognition in images, and for improved document and text search. While many out-of-the-box implementations of machine learning algorithms are currently available, customized methods developed by honed and innovative researchers continue to provide significant improvements in various contexts. Advancements through basic research continue to break the barriers of the extent of ML's contribution to the world. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Typically studies of the effects of aging on cognitive-motor performance emphasize changes in elderly populations. Although some research is directly concerned with when age-related decline actually begins, studies are often based on relatively simple reaction time tasks, making it impossible to gauge the impact of experience in compensating for this decline in a real world task. The present study investigates age-related changes in cognitive motor performance through adolescence and adulthood in a complex real world task, the real-time strategy video game StarCraft 2. In this paper we analyze the influence of age on performance using a dataset of 3,305 players, aged 16-44, collected by Thompson, Blair, Chen & Henrey [1]. Using a piecewise regression analysis, we find that age-related slowing of within-game, self-initiated response times begins at 24 years of age. We find no evidence for the common belief expertise should attenuate domainspecific cognitive decline. Domain-specific response time declines appear to persist regardless of skill level. A second analysis of dual-task performance finds no evidence of a corresponding age-related decline. Finally, an exploratory analyses of other age-related differences suggests that older participants may have been compensating for a loss in response speed through the use of game mechanics that reduce cognitive load. © 2014 Thompson et al.},

We begin by building a model for how researchers split their effort between multiple papers, and how collaboration affects the number of citations a paper receives, supported by observations from a large real-world publication and citation dataset, which we call the h-Reinvestment model. Using tools from the field of Game Theory, we study researchers' collaborative behavior over time under this model, with the premise that each researcher wants to maximize his or her academic success. We find analytically that there is a strong incentive to collaborate rather than work in isolation, and that studying collaborative behavior through a game-theoretic lens is a promising approach to help us better understand the nature and dynamics of academic collaboration. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.},

abstract={Humans have a remarkable tendency to anthropomorphize moving objects, ascribing to them intentions and emotions as if they were human. Early social psychology research demonstrated that animated film clips depicting the movements of simple geometric shapes could elicit rich interpretations of intentional behavior from viewers. In attempting to model this reasoning process in software, we first address the problem of automatically recognizing humanlike actions in the trajectories of moving shapes. There are two main difficulties. First, there is no defined vocabulary of actions that are recognizable to people from motion trajectories. Second, in order for an automated system to learn actions from motion trajectories using machine-learning techniques, a vast amount of these actiontrajectory pairs is needed as training data. This paper describes an approach to data collection that resolves both of these problems. In a web-based game, called Triangle Charades, players create motion trajectories for actions by animating a triangle to depict those actions. Other players view these animations and guess the action they depict. An action is considered recognizable if players can correctly guess it from animations. To move towards defining a controlled vocabulary and collecting a large dataset, we conducted a pilot study in which 87 users played Triangle Charades. Based on this data, we computed a simple metric for action recognizability. Scores on this metric formed a gradual linear pattern, suggesting there is no clear cutoff for determining if an action is recognizable from motion data. These initial results demonstrate the advantages of using a game to collect data for this action recognition task. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={The Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud has gained significant attention in the Semantic Web community over the past few years. With rapid expansion in size and diversity, it consists of over 800 interlinked datasets with over 60 billion triples. These datasets encapsulate structured data and knowledge spanning over varied domains such as entertainment, life sciences, publications, geography, and government. Applications can take advantage of this by using the knowledge distributed over the interconnected datasets, which is not realistic to find in a single place elsewhere. However, two of the key obstacles in using the LOD cloud are the limited support for data integration tasks over concepts, instances, and properties, and relevant data source selection for querying over multiple datasets. We review, in brief, some of the important and interesting technical approaches found in the literature that address these two issues. We observe that the general purpose alignment techniques developed outside the LOD context fall short in meeting the heterogeneous data representation of LOD. Therefore, an LOD-specific review of these techniques (especially for alignment) is important to the community. The topics covered and discussed in this article fall under two broad categories, namely alignment techniques for LOD datasets and relevant data source selection in the context of query processing over LOD datasets.

abstract={Motivation: We introduce a novel method for visualizing high dimensional data via a discrete dynamical system. This method provides a 2D representation of the relationship between subjects according to a set of variables without geometric projections, transformed axes or principal components. The algorithm exploits a memory-type mechanism inherent in a certain class of discrete dynamical systems collectively referred to as the chaos game that are closely related to iterative function systems. The goal of the algorithm was to create a human readable representation of high dimensional patient data that was capable of detecting unrevealed subclusters of patients from within anticipated classifications. This provides a mechanism to further pursue a more personalized exploration of pathology when used with medical data. For clustering and classification protocols, the dynamical system portion of the algorithm is designed to come after some feature selection filter and before some model evaluation (e.g. clustering accuracy) protocol. In the version given here, a univariate features selection step is performed (in practice more complex feature selection methods are used), a discrete dynamical system is driven by this reduced set of variables (which results in a set of 2D cluster models), these models are evaluated for their accuracy (according to a user-defined binary classification) and finally a visual representation of the top classification models are returned. Thus, in addition to the visualization component, this methodology can be used for both supervised and unsupervised machine learning as the top performing models are returned in the protocol we describe here.Results: Butterfly, the algorithm we introduce and provide working code for, uses a discrete dynamical system to classify high dimensional data and provide a 2D representation of the relationship between subjects. We report results on three datasets (two in the article; one in the appendix) including a public lung cancer dataset that comes along with the included Butterfly R package. In the included R script, a univariate feature selection method is used for the dimension reduction step, but in the future we wish to use a more powerful multivariate feature reduction method based on neural networks (Kriesel, 2007). © 2013 The Author 2013.

abstract={We screened for tick-borne pathogens blood samples from 181 wild and domestic ungulates belonging to 18 host species in 4 South African Provinces. Polymerase chain reaction followed by reverse line blotting and sequencing allowed detecting 16 tick-borne pathogen species belonging to the genera Babesia, Theileria, Anaplasma, and Ehrlichia. Ten pathogen species were involved in 29 new host-pathogen combinations. Most infections (77.9%) involved more than one pathogen species. Principal component analysis (PCA) assigned the 163 infections, identified to species level, to 4 groups. Three groups were associated with sheep, cattle, and horse and their respective wild counterparts. Each group was characterised by high homogeneity in pathogen assemblage and host phylogenetic status. These groups characterised the most privileged transmission routes between and among wild and domestic ungulates. The 4th group showed high heterogeneity in pathogen assemblage and host phylogenetic status. This group seems to indicate frequent spill over events in impala of pathogens that usually circulate among cattle- or sheep-related species. Within 6 localities, we sampled an equal number of wild and domestic animals (n= 128). On this dataset once having controlled for the significant variation among localities, the infection prevalence and intensity of infection did not differ significantly between wild and domestic hosts. This suggests that both animal types, domestic and wild hosts, could act as evenly efficient sources of infection for themselves and for each other. Overall, this study shed new light on the pathogen circulation naturally achieved at the interplay between wild and domestic ungulates. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract={Biomedical science has proven that human brain fiber tracts have correspondent relationship with the physiological functions, and it has important medical significance to cluster the brain fibers accurately. But because of the huge number of brain fibers, manually segmenting brain fibers will result in time and effort consuming. And for the extreme complexity of the distribution of brain fibers that different types of brain fibers cross with each other, automatically mapping brain fibers using unsupervised clustering algorithms cannot give satisfactory results. This work proposed a Large Margin Nearest Cluster metric based semi-supervised clustering algorithm called LISODATA, which can better separate crossing fiber tracts by employing a small amount of supervised information. The experimental results on the brain fiber dataset provided by the 2009 PBC demonstrated that LISODA T A could improve the purity of brain fiber clusters compared to ISODA T A. © 2014 Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

abstract={Nowadays, social networks are extremely large-scale with tremendous information flows, where understanding how the information diffuse over social networks becomes an important research issue. Most of the existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on either network structure modeling or empirical approach with dataset mining. However, the information diffusion is also heavily influenced by network users' decisions, actions and their socio-economic connections, which is generally ignored by existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks. To verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct experiments by using Facebook network and real-world information spreading dataset of Memetracker. Experiment results show that the proposed game theoretic framework is effective and practical in modeling the social network users' information forwarding behaviors. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Growth in legal gaming in the United States over the past quarter century or so is well-documented. One important factor fueling this growth was the passage of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, which permitted Native American tribes to establish, under agreements or "compacts" with the states in which they are located, casinos offering what is known as Class III gaming: slot machines, blackjack, roulette, and other games. Since the passage of the Act, there have been 21 Native American casinos established in Michigan. Also, three non-Native American casinos opened in Detroit in 1999 and 2000. This growth in the number of casinos has sparked a wide-ranging debate over the social and economic impacts of casino development.The purpose of this research is to focus on the crime issue in the broader casino debate. We investigate the impact of these Michigan casinos on the rates of burglary, robbery, larceny and motor vehicle theft (property crimes) in casino host counties as well as in nearby counties. We employ a panel data set with annual observations on all 83 Michigan counties for the period 1994-2010. The dataset includes crime rates taken from the FBI crime data series, variables for the presence of a casino in a county or in a nearby county, the scale of a casino's operations as measured by revenues, and a variety of control variables suggested by the broader literature investigating the factors that determine crime rates generally.Our results suggest that in most cases the property crime rates studied are not affected by the presence or size of a casino in a county or in a nearby county. The largest such impact, which is negative, is for motor vehicle theft. The size of a casino does have a small positive effect on the motor vehicle theft rate. © 2013 The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.},

This paper aims to categorize sports videos in the wild, captured using mobile phones by people watching a game or practicing a sport. Thus, no assumption is made about video production practices or existence of field lining and equipment. Motivated by distinctiveness of motions in sports activities, we propose a novel motion trajectory descriptor to effectively and efficiently represent a video. Furthermore, temporal analysis of local descriptors is proposed to integrate the categorization decision over time. Experiments on a newly collected dataset of amateur sports videos in the wild demonstrate that our trajectory descriptor is superior for sports videos categorization and temporal analysis improves the categorization accuracy further. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper focuses on predicting player behaviour in two-player games with microtransactions. Typically the games are for free and companies generate their revenue by selling in-game goods. We show creation of a users behaviour model, which are then used in a recommendation system increasing in-game goods purchases. We focus on learning techniques in a novel way, predicting the time of purchases rather than the most likely product to be purchased. The player model is based on in-game signals, such as players success, curiosity, social interactions etc. We had access to a Pool Live Tour game dataset made by Geewa. We report promising results in predicting the purchase events. © 2014 The Authors and IOS Press.},

abstract={Modeling users’ topical interests on microblog is an important but challenging task. In this paper, we propose User Message Model (UMM), a hierarchical topic model specially designed for user modeling on microblog. In UMM, users and their messages are modeled by a hierarchy of topics. Thus, it has the ability to 1) deal with both the data sparseness and the topic diversity problems which previous methods suffer from, and 2) jointly model users and messages in a unified framework. Furthermore, UMM can be easily distributed to handle large-scale datasets. Experimental results on both Sina Weibo and Twitter datasets show that UMM can effectively model users’ interests on microblog. It can achieve better results than previous methods in topic discovery and message recommendation. Experimental results on a large-scale Twitter dataset, containing about 2 million users and 50 million messages, further demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of distributed UMM. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={The aim of this study was to investigate the use and potential of the psychological theory of human-behavior modeling, called the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), in a user-modeling domain. We performed a user experiment involving a well-studied problem of user modeling, i.e., a recommender system (RS) for movies. As a part of the TPB, a survey to estimate the behavioral, normative and control beliefs regarding movie selection was designed. Using the participants' responses an Ajzen model for movie genres was built and evaluated. An existing public dataset for context-aware movie recommendation, CoMoDa, was used to evaluate the proposed method. The results showed that the TPB approach led to an interesting explanation of movie genre selection. Among others, the potential applications of the TPB in recommender systems and the architecture of such a RS were addressed. Questions about the potential applications of the TPB in the user-modeling domain and its limitations and drawbacks were discussed.},

abstract={In order to experiment with machine learning and data mining techniques in the domain of Real-Time Strategy games such as StarCraft, a dataset is required that captures the complex detail of the interactions taking place between the players and the game. This paper describes a new extraction process by which game data is extracted both directly from game log (replay) files, and indirectly through simulating the replays within the StarCraft game engine. Data is then stored in a compact, hierarchical, and easily accessible format. This process is applied to a collection of expert replays, creating a new standardised dataset. The data recorded is enough for almost the complete game state to be reconstructed, from either player's viewpoint, at any point in time (to the nearest second). This process has revealed issues in some of the source replay files, as well as discrepancies in prior datasets. Where practical, these errors have been removed in order to produce a higher-quality reusable dataset. Copyright © 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

abstract={Free-to-Play or 'freemium' games represent a fundamental shift in the business models of the game industry, facilitated by the increasing use of online distribution platforms and the introduction of increasingly powerful mobile platforms. The ability of a game development company to analyze and derive insights from behavioral telemetry is crucial to the success of these games which rely on in-game purchases and in-game advertising to generate revenue, and for the company to remain competitive in a global marketplace. The ability to model, understand and predict future player behavior has a crucial value, allowing developers to obtain data-driven insights to inform design, development and marketing strategies. One of the key challenges is modeling and predicting player churn. This paper presents the first cross-game study of churn prediction in Free-to-Play games. Churn in games is discussed and thoroughly defined as a formal problem, aligning with industry standards. Furthermore, a range of features which are generic to games are defined and evaluated for their usefulness in predicting player churn, e.g. playtime, session length and session intervals. Using these behavioral features, combined with the individual retention model for each game in the dataset used, we develop a broadly applicable churn prediction model, which does not rely on game-design specific features. The presented classifiers are applied on a dataset covering five free-to-play games resulting in high accuracy churn prediction. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Feature selection plays an important role in machine learning and data mining. In recent years, various feature measurements have been proposed to select significant features from high-dimensional datasets. However, most traditional feature selection methods will ignore some features which have strong classification ability as a group but are weak as individuals. To deal with this problem, we redefine the redundancy, interdependence, and independence of features by using neighborhood entropy. Then the neighborhood entropy-based feature contribution is proposed under the framework of cooperative game. The evaluative criteria of features can be formalized as the product of contribution and other classical feature measures. Finally, the proposed method is tested on several UCI datasets. The results show that neighborhood entropy-based cooperative game theory model (NECGT) yield better performance than classical ones. © 2014 Kai Zeng et al.},

abstract={Standby power consumption often takes place unnoticeably, the negligence of which often leads to intangible energy waste. Although there have been several studies related to this issue, no method has been developed to estimate the amount of power consumed this way by analyzing users' power consumption data. Therefore, this paper, based on findings of previous researches and users' power consumption data, proposes an innovative model to characterize users' standby power consumption. Firstly, by considering power data as continuous signal, standby power consumption is estimated by using frequency analysis and high frequency denoising model. Furthermore, Signal decomposition analysis has also been implemented as well as the conduction of rigorous mathematical derivation to get the average standby power based on thousands of power consumption data from Chinese users. Finally, results show that this method successfully separates standby power from the whole consumption dataset. Users are divided into four types based on the distribution of standby mode and nominal mode. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Online social networks, particularly Facebook has become one of the most popular platforms for students to make connections, share information, and interact with each other. In modern socializing society, many distinct patterns can be deduced from the observations. These specific traits provide direct benefit to businesses as students can sometimes act as spokesman for their merchandises on social media without extra investment. In this paper, the implications of Facebook 'share' with respect to commercial gain are analyzed based on students' behaviors. An interaction matrix of 'share' interaction and profile data are composed as a dataset which are clustered into six eligible groups of commercial segment: dining, itinerary, pets, entertainment, games, and gifts/varieties. Pervasive classification algorithms: KNN, Decision Tree, NaïveBayes and SVM are applied to explore the opportunity of target products. According to our findings, SVM outperforms the others with accuracy of 87.95 % due to its distinctive characteristic in handling imbalanced data. The classification results reveal that the merchandises that have high potential in the campus are entertainment CDs, itinerary and pets. This valuable result can also be expediently applied to new-coming students. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Gaming expertise is usually accumulated through playing or watching many game instances, and identifying critical moments in these game instances called turning points. Turning point rules (shorten as TPRs) are game patterns that almost always lead to some irreversible outcomes. In this paper, we formulate the notion of irreversible outcome property which can be combined with pattern mining so as to automatically extract TPRs from any given game datasets. We specifically extend the well-known PrefixSpan sequence mining algorithm by incorporating the irreversible outcome property. To show the usefulness of TPRs, we apply them to Tetris, a popular game. We mine TPRs from Tetris games and generate challenging game sequences so as to help training an intelligent Tetris algorithm. Our experiment results show that 1) TPRs can be found from historical game data automatically with reasonable scalability, 2) our TPRs are able to help Tetris algorithm perform better when it is trained with challenging game sequences.

abstract={Contemporary users (players, consumers) of digital games have thousands of products to choose from, which makes finding games that fit their interests challenging. Towards addressing this challenge, in this paper two different formulations of Archetypal Analysis for Top-L recommender tasks using implicit feedback are presented: factor- and neighborhood-oriented models. These form the first application of rec- ommender systems to digital games. Both models are tested on a dataset of 500,000 users of the game distribution platform Steam, covering game ownership and playtime data across more than 3000 games. Compared to four other recommender models (nearest neighbor, two popularity mod- els, random baseline), the archetype based models provide the highest recall rates showing that Archetypal Analysis can be successfully applied for Top-L recommendation purposes.

abstract={The collection and analysis of behavioral telemetry in digital games has in the past five years become an integral part of game development. One of the key challenges in game analytics is the development of methods for characterizing and predicting player behavior as it evolves over time. Characterizing behavior is necessary for monitoring player populations and gradually improve game design and the playing experience. Predicting behavior is necessary to describe player engagement and prevent future player churn. In this paper, methods and theory from kernel archetype analysis and random process models are utilized to evaluate the playtime behavior, i.e. time spent playing specific games as a function of time, of over 6 million players, across more than 3000 PC and console games from the Steam platform, covering a combined playtime of more than 5 billion hours. A number of conclusions can be derived from this large-scale analysis, notably that playtime as a function of time, across the thousands of games in the dataset, and irrespective of local differences in the playtime frequency distribution, can be modeled using the same model: the Weibull distribution. This suggests that there are fundamental properties governing player engagement as it evolves over time, which we here refer to as the Playtime Principle. Additionally, the analysis shows that there are distinct clusters, or archetypes, in the playtime frequency distributions of the investigated games. These archetypal groups correspond to specific playtime distributions. Finally, the analysis reveals information about player behavior across a very large dataset, showing for example that the vast majority of games are players for less than 10 hours, and very few players spend more than 30-35 hours on any specific game. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In online games, often the only truly unique thing about a player is the name associated with an online account or game character. In massively multiplayer online games like World of Warcraft, customization options are limited and in multiplayer games like Battlefield, there are no ways of customizing the appearance of the players' avatar. This lack of ability to visually distinguish oneself means that names become important in online games, and assists with building understanding of the people that play these games, which is notably important for games operating via Free-to-Play revenue models. Here, a large-scale, cross-game analysis of names and behaviors in games is presented, based on datasets spanning over eight million character names and 80,000 gamer tags with associated behavioral data, from four major commercial game titles: the role-playing game World of Warcraft and the tactical shooters Battlefield 2 Bad Company 2, Crysis and Medal of Honor. The results highlight the inventiveness of the names players adopt for their characters or accounts, and describe two different patterns - or communities - of name usage: in World of Warcraft, player character names are distributed according to power laws, have semantic meaning (no numbers permitted in names), and name selection is related to the aesthetics and game function of characters, with some names even being predictors of particular classes and races. In the tactical shooters, where all gamer tags are unique, names comparatively more rarely have a clear semantic meaning (numbers and special characters are permitted and often used), and name components are not distributed according to power laws. However, there is to a degree of a non-random relationship between gamer tag and in-game behavior. These results indicate that the name chosen by players for their characters or tags can potentially be useful for player profiling purposes in online games. © 2014 International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={We address the problem of retrieving chess game positions similar to a given query position from a collection of archived chess games. We investigate this problem from an information retrieval (IR) perspective. The advantage of our proposed IR-based approach is that it allows using the standard inverted organization of stored chess positions, leading to an efficient retrieval. Moreover, in contrast to retrieving exactly identical board positions, the IR-based approach is able to provide approximate search functionality. In order to define the similarity between two chess board positions, we encode each game state with a textual representation. This textual encoding is designed to represent the position, reach-ability and the connectivity between chess pieces. Due to the absence of a standard IR dataset that can be used for this search task, a new evaluation benchmark dataset was constructed comprising of documents (chess positions) from a freely available chess game archive. Experiments conducted on this dataset demonstrate that our proposed method of similarity computation, which takes into account a combination of the mobility and the connectivities between the chess pieces, performs well on the search task, achieving MAP and nDCG values of 0:4233 and 0:6922 respectively.

abstract={We study the computational complexity of computing Nash equilibria in generalized interdependent-security (IDS) games. Like traditional IDS games, originally introduced by economists and risk-assessment experts Heal and Kunreuther about a decade ago, generalized IDS games model agents' voluntary investment decisions when facing potential direct risk and transfer-risk exposure from other agents. A distinct feature of generalized IDS games, however, is that full investment can reduce transfer risk. As a result, depending on the transfer-risk reduction level, generalized IDS games may exhibit strategic complementarity (SC) or strategic substitutability (SS). We consider three variants of generalized IDS games in which players exhibit only SC, only SS, and both SC+SS. We show that determining whether there is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in SC+SS-type games is NP-complete, while computing a single PSNE in SC-type games takes worst-case polynomial time. As for the problem of computing all mixed-strategy Nash equilibria (MSNE) efficiently, we produce a partial characterization. Whenever each agent in the game is indiscriminate in terms of the transfer-risk exposure to the other agents, a case that Kearns and Ortiz originally studied in the context of traditional IDS games in their NIPS 2003 paper, we can compute all MSNE that satisfy some ordering constraints in polynomial time in all three game variants. Yet, there is a computational barrier in the general (transfer) case: we show that the computational problem is as hard as the Pure-Nash-Extension problem, also originally introduced by Kearns and Ortiz, and that it is NP-complete for all three variants. Finally, we experimentally examine and discuss the practical impact that the additional protection from transfer risk allowed in generalized IDS games has on MSNE by solving several randomly-generated instances of SC+SS-type games with graph structures taken from several real-world datasets.},

In this game theoretical context, a strategy corresponds to a particular affinity between a group of features forming a cluster, and the payoff function is computed based on the weighted distance between a feature and a cluster. A zero-sum two-player game problem is solved through a global combination of pair wise features. Finally, each feature is represented by the value of the objective function, at the optimal solution, which indicates the contribution of each feature. The importance of features is then evaluated by their optimal values. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we have conducted a classification task utilizing SVM on various UCI and stat log datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme leads to improvement in classification performance, when compared to mRMR and Fisher score algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Timely and cost-effective analytics over social network has emerged as a key ingredient for success in many businesses and government endeavors. Community detection is an active research area of relevance to analyze online social network. The problem of selecting a particular community detection algorithm is crucial if the aim is to unveil the community structure of a network. The choice of a given methodology could affect the outcome of the experiments because different algorithms have different advantages and depend on tuning specific parameters. In this paper, we propose a community division model based on the notion of game theory, which can combine advantages of previous algorithms effectively to get a better community classification result. By making experiments on some standard dataset, it verifies that our community detection model based on game theory is valid and better. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Information diffusion over social networks becomes a hot topic recently. Most of the existing works are based on the machine learning method with social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the results learned from some specific dataset may not apply to the future networks, since the social network structure is in a highly dynamic environment. Moreover, the dynamics of information diffusion are also heavily influenced by network users' decisions, actions and their socio-economic interactions, which is generally ignored by existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks, which focuses on the users' behavior analysis from a microeconomics points of view. We also conduct experiments by using real-world Twitter information diffusion dataset, which shows that the proposed evolutionary game theoretic model is effective and practical in modeling the social network users' information diffusion dynamics. © 2014 IEEE.},

In experiments, these approaches were evaluated on a public saliency dataset and compared with the state-of-art technologies, and it was shown that the proposed information theoretic saliency model can attain a better performance in comparison with several state-of-art methods.

Therefore, the authors present the theoretical background and a study aiming to understand how game vendors' actions reflect on the monetary value of virtual goods. The study is based on a huge dataset gained from Web shops that were monitored over a period of several months. The data was analysed in order to find out whether effects known from real economies apply to their virtual counterparts. A reset of the virtual economy allowed us to exactly follow price developments. The authors present and discuss their findings, as well as derive directions for future research.

abstract={Protein-protein interactions play a crucial role in biological processes. Protein docking calculations' goal is to predict, given two proteins of known structures, the associate conformation of the corresponding complex. Here, we present a new interactive protein docking system, Udock, that makes use of users' cognitive capabilities added up. In Udock, the users tackle simplified representations of protein structures and explore protein-protein interfaces' conformational space using a gamified interactive docking system with on the fly scoring. We assumed that if given appropriate tools, a naïve user's cognitive capabilities could provide relevant data for (1) the prediction of correct interfaces in binary protein complexes and (2) the identification of the experimental partner in interaction among a set of decoys. To explore this approach experimentally, we conducted a preliminary two week long playtest where the registered users could perform a cross-docking on a dataset comprising 4 binary protein complexes. The users explored almost all the surface of the proteins that were available in the dataset but favored certain regions that seemed more attractive as potential docking spots. These favored regions were located inside or nearby the experimental binding interface for 5 out of the 8 proteins in the dataset. For most of them, the best scores were obtained with the experimental partner. The alpha version of Udock is freely accessible at http://udock.fr. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014.},

Modeling and mining popularity dynamics of social activity has important implications for researchers, content creators and providers. We here investigate the effect of revisits (successive visits from a single user) on content popularity. Using four datasets of social activity, with up to tens of millions media objects (e.g., YouTube videos, Twitter hashtags or LastFM artists), we show the effect of revisits in the popularity evolution of such objects. Secondly, we propose the Phoenix-R model which captures the popularity dynamics of individual objects. Phoenix-R has the desired properties of being: (1) parsimonious, being based on the minimum description length principle, and achieving lower root mean squared error than state-of-the-art baselines; (2) applicable, the model is effective for predicting future popularity values of objects. © 2014 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Current mobile guides often suffer from the following problems: a long knowledge acquisition process of recommending relevant points of interest (POIs), the lack of social navigation support, and the challenge of making implicit user-generated content (e.g., trajectories) useful. Collaborative filtering (CF) is a promising solution for these problems. This article employs CF to mine GPS trajectories for providing Amazon-like POI recommendations. Three CF methods are designed: simple-CF, freq-CF (considering visit frequencies of POIs), and freq-seq-CF (considering both user's preferences and spatio-temporal behaviour). With these, services like "after visiting ..., people similar to you often went to ..." can be provided. The methods are evaluated with two GPS datasets. The results show that the CF methods can provide more accurate predictions than simple location-based methods. Also considering visit frequencies (popularity) of POIs and spatio-temporal motion behaviour (mainly the ways in which POIs are visited) in CF can improve the predictive performance.

Careful and timely analysis and processing of such channels may lead to early detection of emerging trends, critical issues, opportunities, topics of interests, contributors, experts, etc. Social network analytics have been successfully applied in general purpose, online social network platforms, like Facebook and Twitter. However, in order for such techniques to be useful in business context, it is mandatory to integrate them with underlying business systems, processes and practices. Such integration problem is increasingly recognized as Big Data problem.

It opens a space for using approaches originally devised for the Web. The core of our approach is based on our developed platform for independent code monitoring where we create a dataset of developers’ implicit and explicit feedback based on monitoring developers’ behavior. Employing this platform we acquire, generate and process descriptive metadata that indirectly refer source code artifacts, project documentations and developers activities via document models and user models.

We assume the overall ranking, which indicates users' final decision, is closely related to their given value in each criterion separately. We compare user models created using neural networks and linear regression and we show, as expected from the implicit nonlinear combination of criteria, that neural networks based models achieve better performance.

abstract={Recommender systems guide their users in decisions related to personal tastes and choices. The rough set theory can be considered as a useful tool for predicting recommendations in recommender systems. We examine two properties of recommendations with rough sets. The first property refers to accuracy or appropriateness of recommendations and the second property highlights the generality or coverage of recommendations. Making highly accurate recommendations for majority of the users is a major hindrance in achieving high quality performance for recommender systems. In the probabilistic rough set models, these two properties are controlled by thresholds (α,β). One of the research issues is to determine effective values of these thresholds based on the two considered properties. We apply the game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model to obtain suitable values of these thresholds by implementing a game for determining a trade-off and balanced solution between accuracy and generality. Experimental results on movielen dataset suggest that the GTRS improves the two properties of recommendations leading to better overall performance compared to the Pawlak rough set model. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents a game-theoretic approach for community detection in dynamic social networks in which each node is treated as a rational agent who periodically chooses from a set of predefined actions in order to maximize its utility function. The community structure of a snapshot emerges after the game reaches Nash equilibrium; the partitions and agent information are then transferred to the next snapshot. An evaluation of our method on two real world dynamic datasets (AS-Internet Routers Graph and AS-Oregon Graph) demonstrates that we are able to report more stable and accurate communities over time compared to the benchmark methods. © 2014 IEEE.},

We use a random forest method to combine pre-play variables to estimate Win Probability (WP) before any play of an NFL game. When a subset of NFL play-by-play data for the 12 seasons from 2001 to 2012 is used as a training dataset, our method provides WP estimates that resemble true win probability and accurately predict game outcomes, especially in the later stages of games. In addition to being intrinsically interesting in real time to observers of an NFL football game, our WP estimates can provide useful evaluations of plays and, in some cases, coaching decisions. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston.},

To efficiently analyze these evolutions, one needs to obtain information from multiple sources and correlate it in a meaningful way. Typically, this process involves manual labor and/or is left to specific community sites. In this paper, a semi-automated mechanism is presented that scrapes this information from community sites and 'tags' games depending on their properties, independent of the source of the information. By correlating the tags, one can easily create a large database of MMO games and extract historical trends from the data. Also in this paper, the analysis of such a dataset is presented, which sheds light on the historical evolution of MMOs based on several metrics such as genre, type, monetization, deployment technology and game-dependent characteristics.

abstract={18 months may seem a short time in absolute terms but in the corporate world and especially when referring to entrepreneurship 18 months is usually a figure associated to life expectancy, with 80% technology startups crashing and burning in their first 18 months. HAVAS has launched 18 Innovation Labs, a global initiative aiming to identify startups in the intersection of technology and media, in order to co-create new ways to revolutionize the media and entertainment industry. HAVAS seeks to interconnect startups, innovators, technology trends, other companies, and universities worldwide in a Knowledge Graph that supports analytics and strategic decision-making for the incorporation of such talent within their 18 months life span. In this talk we describe the 18 Labs initiative, challenges, and business expectations and how semantic technologies are key for realizing this vision by extracting startup information from online sources, structuring and enriching it into an actionable, self-sustainable semantic dataset, and providing media businesses with strategic knowledge about the most trending innovations.

abstract={This paper proposes a simple yet effective face sketch synthesis method. Similar to existing exemplar-based methods, a training dataset containing photo-sketch pairs is required, and a K-NN photo patch search is performed between a test photo and every training exemplar for sketch patch selection. Instead of using the Markov Random Field to optimize global sketch patch selection, this paper formulates face sketch synthesis as an image denoising problem which can be solved efficiently using the proposed method. Real-time performance can be obtained on a state-of-the-art GPU. Meanwhile quantitative evaluations on face sketch recognition and user study demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In addition, the proposed method can be directly extended to the temporal domain for consistent video sketch synthesis, which is of great importance in digital entertainment. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Event sequences, such as patients' medical histories or users' sequences of product reviews, trace how individuals progress over time. Identifying common patterns, or progression stages, in such event sequences is a challenging task because not every individual follows the same evolutionary pattern, stages may have very different lengths, and individuals may progress at different rates. In this paper, we develop a model-based method for discovering common progression stages in general event sequences. We develop a generative model in which each sequence belongs to a class, and sequences from a given class pass through a common set of stages, where each sequence evolves at its own rate. We then develop a scalable algorithm to infer classes of sequences, while also segmenting each sequence into a set of stages. We evaluate our method on event sequences, ranging from patients' medical histories to online news and navigational traces from the Web. The evaluation shows that our methodology can predict future events in a sequence, while also accurately inferring meaningful progression stages, and effectively grouping sequences based on common progression patterns. More generally, our methodology allows us to reason about how event sequences progress over time, by discovering patterns and categories of temporal evolution in large-scale datasets of events.

abstract={Social networks have become ubiquitous in our daily life, as such they have attracted great research interests recently. A key challenge is that it is of extremely large-scale with tremendous information flow, creating the phenomenon of 'Big Data.' Under such a circumstance, understanding information diffusion over social networks has become an important research issue. Most of the existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on either network structure modeling or empirical approach with dataset mining. However, the information diffusion is also heavily influenced by network users' decisions, actions and their socio-economic connections, which is generally ignored in existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks. Specifically, we analyze the framework in uniform degree and non-uniform degree networks and derive the closed-form expressions of the evolutionary stable network states. Moreover, the information diffusion over two special networks, Erdo{double acute}s-Rényi random network and the Barabási-Albert scale-free network, are also highlighted. To verify our theoretical analysis, we conduct experiments by using both synthetic networks and real-world Facebook network, as well as real-world information spreading dataset of Memetracker. Experiments shows that the proposed game theoretic framework is effective and practical in modeling the social network users' information forwarding behaviors. © 2007-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Recommender systems are emerging as an important business tool in E-commerce. The recommendations in these systems typically rely on some sort of intelligent mechanisms that analyze previous user trends and ratings to make personalized recommendations. In this article, we examine the application of game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) model as an alternative intelligent component for recommender systems. The role of GTRS is examined by considering two important properties of recommendations. The first property is the accuracy of recommendations and the second property is the generality or support of recommendations. It is argued that making highly accurate recommendations for majority of the users is a major hindrance and difficulty for improving the performance of recommender systems. The GTRS meets this challenge by examining a tradeoff solution between the properties of accuracy and generality. Experimental results on movielen dataset suggest that the GTRS improves the two properties of recommendations compared to the standard Pawlak rough set model. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

We observe a Markov chain in session search: user's judgment of retrieved documents in the previous search iteration affects user's actions in the next iteration. We thus propose to model session search as a dual-agent stochastic game: the user agent and the search engine agent work together to jointly maximize their long term rewards. The framework, which we term "win-win search", is based on Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We mathematically model dynamics in session search, including decision states, query changes, clicks, and rewards, as a cooperative game between the user and the search engine. The experiments on TREC 2012 and 2013 Session datasets show a statistically significant improvement over the state-of-the-art interactive search and session search algorithms. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

First, we construct the W8-RGBD dataset including RGB-D images of different people with ground truth weight. Second, the novel sideview shape feature and the feature fusion model are proposed to facilitate weight estimation. Additionally, we consider gender as another important factor for human weight estimation. Third, we conduct comprehensive experiments using various regression models and feature fusion models on the new weight dataset, and encouraging results are obtained based on the proposed features and models. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Molecular signatures for predicting breast cancer prognosis could greatly improve care through personalization of treatment. Computational analyses of genome-wide expression datasets have identified such signatures, but these signatures leave much to be desired in terms of accuracy, reproducibility, and biological interpretability. Methods that take advantage of structured prior knowledge (eg, protein interaction networks) show promise in helping to define better signatures, but most knowledge remains unstructured. Crowdsourcing via scientific discovery games is an emerging methodology that has the potential to tap into human intelligence at scales and in modes unheard of before. Objective: The main objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that knowledge linking expression patterns of specific genes to breast cancer outcomes could be captured from players of an open, Web-based game. We envisioned capturing knowledge both from the player's prior experience and from their ability to interpret text related to candidate genes presented to them in the context of the game. Methods: We developed and evaluated an online game called The Cure that captured information from players regarding genes for use as predictors of breast cancer survival. Information gathered from game play was aggregated using a voting approach, and used to create rankings of genes. The top genes from these rankings were evaluated using annotation enrichment analysis, comparison to prior predictor gene sets, and by using them to train and test machine learning systems for predicting 10 year survival. Results: Between its launch in September 2012 and September 2013, The Cure attracted more than 1000 registered players, who collectively played nearly 10,000 games. Gene sets assembled through aggregation of the collected data showed significant enrichment for genes known to be related to key concepts such as cancer, disease progression, and recurrence. In terms of the predictive accuracy of models trained using this information, these gene sets provided comparable performance to gene sets generated using other methods, including those used in commercial tests. The Cure is available on the Internet. Conclusions: The principal contribution of this work is to show that crowdsourcing games can be developed as a means to address problems involving domain knowledge. While most prior work on scientific discovery games and crowdsourcing in general takes as a premise that contributors have little or no expertise, here we demonstrated a crowdsourcing system that succeeded in capturing expert knowledge.},

abstract={Many phenomena in the real world can be represented as multinomial relations, which involve multiple and heterogeneous objects. For instance, in social media, users' various actions such as adding annotations to web resources or sharing news with their friends can be represented by multinomial relations which involve multiple and heterogeneous objects such as users, documents, keywords and locations. Predicting multinomial relations would improve many fundamental applications in various domains such as online marketing, social media analyses and drug development. However, the high-dimensional property of such multinomial relations poses one fundamental challenge, that is, predicting multinomial relations with only a limited amount of data. In this paper, we propose a new multinomial relation prediction method, which is robust to data sparsity. We transform each instance of a multinomial relation into a set of binomial relations between the objects and the multinomial relation of the involved objects. We then apply an extension of a low-dimensional embedding technique to these binomial relations, which results in a generalized eigenvalue problem guaranteeing global optimal solutions. We also incorporate attribute information as side information to address the "cold start"problem in multinomial relation prediction. Experiments with various real-world social web service datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust against data sparseness as compared to several existing methods, which can only find sub-optimal solutions. © The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence 2014.},

abstract={We present a semi-supervised approach to recognize faces or people while incorporating crowd-sourced and gamified feedback to iteratively improve recognition accuracy. Unlike traditional approaches which are often limited to explicit feedback, we model ambiguous feedback information that we implicitly gather through a crowd that plays a game. We devise a graph-based recognition approach that incorporates such ambiguous feedback to jointly recognize people across an entire dataset. Multiple experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our gamified feedback approach. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Exergaming is expanding as an option for sedentary behavior in childhood/adult obesity and for extra exercise for gamers. This paper presents the development process for a mobile active sports exergame with near-realistic motions through the usage of body-wearable sensors. The process begins by collecting a dataset specifically targeted to mapping real-world activities directly to the games, then, developing the recognition system in a fashion to produce an enjoyable game. The classification algorithm in this paper has precision and recall of 77% and 77% respectively, compared with 40% and 19% precision and recall on current activity monitoring algorithms intended for general daily living activities. Aside from classification, the user experience must be strong enough to be a successful system for adoption. Indeed, fast and intense activities as well as competitive, multiplayer environments make for a successful, enjoyable exergame. This enjoyment is evaluated through a 30 person user study. Multiple aspects of the exergaming user experience trials have been merged into a comprehensive survey, called ExerSurvey. All but one user thought the motions in the game were realistic and difficult to cheat. Ultimately, a game with near-realistic motions was shown to be an enjoyable, active video exergame for any environment. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We present a study on the application of data mining to extract design patterns from Unreal Tournament III levels used in the online gaming scene for Duel and Team Deathmatch games. The maps' topological structure and their morphology was extracted using ad hoc bots we developed and several statistics have been computed using typical graph algorithms. The process resulted in datasets containing information about all the relevant positions in the maps (the nodes in the game navigation mesh used in the Unreal game engine) and their role in the game (i.e., whether they are navigation points, ammo pickups, weapon pickups, or powerup pickups). We have applied four data mining algorithms to the data to characterize both (i) the maps' type (Duel and Team Deathmatch) based on the feature of the nodes they contain and (ii) the node types (ammo, weapon, powerup, or navigation) based on their features. Our results suggest that the maps' type can be characterized in terms of the nodes they contain but it is difficult to characterize the role of nodes based solely on their features. © 2014 IEEE.},

In this paper, we present an empirical study on using linguistic evidence to predict the expertise of a speaker in a task: playing chess. Instructional chess literature claims that the mindsets of amateur and expert players differ fundamentally (Silman, 1999); psychological science has empirically arrived at similar results (e.g., Pfau and Murphy (1988)). We conduct experiments on automatically predicting chess player skill based on their natural language game commentary. We make use of annotated chess games, in which players provide their own interpretation of game in prose. Based on a dataset collected from an online chess forum, we predict player strength through SVM classification and ranking. We show that using textual and chess-specific features achieves both high classification accuracy and significant correlation. Finally, we compare our findings to claims from the chess literature and results from psychology.},

Humans prefer to drive games into positions with fewer reasonable options and earlier resolutions, even when playing as human-computer freestyle tandems. The question of whether the phenomenon (1) owes more to human perception of relative value, akin to phenomena documented by Kahneman and Tversky, or to rational risk-taking in unbalanced situations, is also addressed.

abstract={Most existing software packages for sports video analysis require manual annotation of important events in the video. Despite being the most popular sport in the United States, most American football game analysis is still done manually. Line of scrimmage and offensive team formation recognition are two statistics that must be tagged by American Football coaches when watching and evaluating past play video clips, a process which takesmanyman hours per week. These two statistics are the building blocks for more high-level analysis such as play strategy inference and automatic statistic generation. In this chapter, we propose a novel framework where given an American football play clip, we automatically identify the video frame in which the offensive team lines in formation (formation frame), the line of scrimmage for that play, and the type of player formation the offensive team takes on. The proposed framework achieves 95% accuracy in detecting the formation frame, 98% accuracy in detecting the line of scrimmage, and up to 67%accuracy in classifying the offensive team’s formation. To validate our framework, we compiled a large dataset comprising more than 800 play-clips of standard and high definition resolution from real-world football games.

abstract={Purpose - To examine the potential for including forums in an online ethnography that draws on data from multiple online sites.
Methodology/approach - Taking a broadly post-structuralist approach to identity and embodiment online, the research drew on three sources of data: asynchronous email interviews, in-game participant observation and six months of forum observation.
Findings - The community in question was socially located around multiple field sites online and forums remain an integral part of the social lives of online gamers. The practice and ethics for examining forums from a qualitative perspective are outlined and how this can fit into an ethnographic account. Some of the data is then presented from this strand of the research to illustrate how researching a forum as a 'lurker' can complement theoretical trajectories and analyses from other parts of the dataset.
Originality - This research details a novel way of examining forums qualitatively as part of a larger dataset. Furthermore, the chapter posits how relatively unobtrusive methods of observation can bring to the fore the ways in which prejudice still structures online social interaction.

To answer the question, I present a large new dataset on the negotiation positions of the almost fifty largest WTO members. The dataset is based on a manual coding of the statements by the member states' ministers at the ministerial conferences in the years 1996-2011. After the aggregation and quantification of these data, a game-theoretical analysis is performed on them. On the basis of this analysis, I find a relatively large zone of agreement among the states and the Nash bargaining solution of their negotiations.},

To show the utility of this framework, we present an implementation in the domain of fractions and numberlines, using an online educational game as the source of players. Our system is able to automatically explore the parameter space and generate hypotheses about what types of numberlines lead to maximal short-term transfer; testing on a separate dataset shows the most promising hypotheses are valid. We briefly discuss our results in the context of the wider educational literature, showing that one of our results is not explained by current research on multiple fraction representations, thus proving our ability to generate potentially interesting hypotheses to test.

abstract={Several studies have used the fingerprint, a mathematical technique that generates a representation-independent functional signature of a game playing strategy, to conduct automated analyses of spaces of strategies. This study looks at an even larger state space, namely a grid over the probabilistic 2-state finite transducers, as a representation for playing Prisoner's Dilemma. Even using just a three-level {0, 0.5, 1} grid amounts to 100,000 representable strategies, with an immense 40,679 unique strategies within. All strategies are fingerprinted and all pairwise distances computed, then hierarchical clustering reduces this dataset to around size 10,000 for further analysis with multidimensional scaling. Results indicate that the 20-dimensional grid has no obvious cutoff scales of structure, that we can quantify several important dimensions, and a high level of similarity with past results on smaller state spaces. We also find an interesting difference between complete playing equivalence of deterministic versus probabilistic transducers. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, an algorithm to select feature subsets for hyper-spectral image classification using the principle of coalition game theory is presented. The feature selection algorithms associated with non-linear kernel based Support Vector Machines (SVM) are either NP-hard or greedy and hence, not very optimal. To deal with this problem, a metric based on the principles of coalition game theory called Shapely value and a sampling approximation is used to determine the contribution of a subset of features towards the classification task. Starting with a few subsets of features, we successively partition each of them into smaller parts if the smaller parts contribute more than a pre-determined threshold compared to the parent subset. The algorithm is terminated when the subsets of features do not change from one iteration to the next. The final subsets of features are then used in multiple kernels and sparse weights of these kernels are optimally learned to build a maximum margin classifier. The algorithm is applied on real hyperspectral datasets and the results are presented in the paper. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The SOFR model is modified for SOCs in consumer electronics applications such as game consoles for advanced logic technology nodes (∼2X nm). Using a representative voltage/temperature dataset from XBOX ONE SOC operation, a quantitative measure of 'degree of over-design coefficient (df)' is developed to better understand the impact of worst case reliability assumptions on thermal design. A simple analytical model is also developed to illustrate the relationship between silicon level failure rates and a system level thermal design parameter (h), or the heat transfer coefficient. The heat transfer coefficient (h) is also identified as a proxy for thermal design elements such as heat sink size, fan size and speed, which strongly influence user experience. It is thus emphasized that use of SOFR model minimizes thermal over-design, thereby improving user experience, without compromising reliability © 2014 IEEE.},

Face2Mus streams songs from online radio stations and classifies them into emotion classes based on audio features using an energy aware support vector machine (SVM) classifier. In parallel, the application captures images of the user's face using the smartphone or tablet's camera and classifying them into one of three emotions, using a multiclass SVM trained on facial geometric distances and wrinkles. The audio classification based on regular SVM achieved an overall testing accuracy of 99.83% when trained on the Million Song Dataset subset, whereas the energy aware SVM exhibited an average degradation of 1.93% when a 59% reduction in the number of support vectors (SV) is enforced. The image classification achieved an overall testing accuracy of 87.5% using leave one out validation on a home-made image database. The overall application requires 272KB of storage space, 12 to 24 MB of RAM and a startup time of approximately 2 minutes. Aside from its entertainment potentials, Face2Mus has possible usage in music therapy for improving people's well-being and emotional status. © 2014 IEEE.},

Thus, the ability to interact with non-expert users is becoming a key requirement. Even if user utterances can be efficiently recognized and transcribed by Automatic Speech Recognition systems, several issues arise in translating them into suitable robotic actions. In this paper, we will discuss both approaches providing two existing Natural Language Understanding workflows for Human Robot Interaction. First, we discuss a grammar based approach: it is based on grammars thus recognizing a restricted set of commands. Then, a data driven approach, based on a free-from speech recognizer and a statistical semantic parser, is discussed. The main advantages of both approaches are discussed, also from an engineering perspective, i.e. considering the effort of realizing HRI systems, as well as their reusability and robustness. An empirical evaluation of the proposed approaches is carried out on several datasets, in order to understand performances and identify possible improvements towards the design of NLP components in HRI. © 2014 The Authors and IOS Press.},

User Profile contains basic information such as interests, academic background, behavior, etc and personal information such as DOB, contact details, etc. Since the user profile contains confidential information, there are some privacy issues. In this Paper, we implement big data techniques to construct user profile from web log files and the associated privacy challenge has been discussed. The results are compared with non- Hadoop approach in a java environment and the proposed work produces better time efficiency and processing speed. © Research India Publications.},

abstract={Online social networks serves as an arena for its members to get in touch with each other, mutually share their information, ideas among themselves. In online social networks the members usually proclaim a profile, which consists of work and education, arts and entertainment and some basic information like gender, e-mail, etc., Such profile facilitates in spotting people, know about their interest, and interact with them in need. The intention of this research is to devise an algorithm to extract information such as name, email address, gender and interest of facebook users from a URL and to predict the gender if unspecified. The Dataset used in this work is a list of 100 million Facebook URLs. This research work paves a way to identify the email communities in Facebook. The outcome of this research reveals the fact that most of the email domains of the facebook user's fall into yahoo, hotmail, Gmail and msn. The other domains are with least number of users. The users with Yahoo id are higher when compared to other email domains. It also discloses that majority of the interest of facebook members is towards sports. It is followed by music, technology, travelling, God and Temple run, PC gaming. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={The reliability of long-term population estimates is crucial for conservation and management purposes. Most game species population monitoring programs assume that count indices are proportionally related to abundance. However, this assumption is untenable when detection varies spatially and temporally. We assessed whether N-mixture models, which allow detection modeling using spatially and temporally repeated count data, were relevant for monitoring the population of red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa). Unbiased estimates are needed for calculating hunting quotas for this game species. We used the simple aural playback point-count method and a dataset of 121 point-transects (n=16,288 counts) collected from 1992 to 2010. Covariates such as date, hour, wind, rain, and vegetation density influenced detection probability. Estimated abundance ranged from 0 to 15 males per point and exhibited variable coefficients of variation depending on sites (range: 0.14-1.31, mean: 0.44). We found a positive and linear relationship between the abundance estimated by the N-mixture model and the densities provided by 2 other counting methods, square sampling and kilometric abundance index, but not with blank beat. We established a maximum detection radius for the playback surveys, which enabled conversion of abundance at the points into density. The N-mixture modeling approach is more cost-effective for game species monitoring than capture-recapture methods or square sampling, and more reliable than indices of relative abundances. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={The Olympic Games are an important sporting event with notable consequences for the general economic landscape of the host city. Traditional economic assessments focus on the aggregated impact of the event on the national income, but fail to provide micro-scale insights on why local businesses will benefit from the increased activity during the Games. In this paper we provide a novel approach to modeling the impact of the Olympic Games on local retailers by analyzing a dataset mined from a large location-based social service, Foursquare. We hypothesize that the spatial positioning of businesses as well as the mobility trends of visitors are primary indicators of whether retailers will rise their popularity during the event. To confirm this we formulate a retail winners prediction task in the context of which we evaluate a set of geographic and mobility metrics. We find that the proximity to stadiums, the diversity of activity in the neighborhood, the nearby area sociability, as well as the probability of customer flows from and to event places such as stadiums and parks are all vital factors. Through supervised learning techniques we demonstrate that the success of businesses hinges on a combination of both geographic and mobility factors. Our results suggest that location-based social networks, where crowdsourced information about the dynamic interaction of users with urban spaces becomes publicly available, present an alternative medium to assess the economic impact of large scale events in a city..

abstract={Recognizing faces acquired in the thermal spectrum from a gallery of visible face images is a desired capability for the military and homeland security, especially for nighttime surveillance and intelligence gathering. However, thermal-tovisible face recognition is a highly challenging problem, due to the large modality gap between thermal and visible imaging. In this paper, we propose a thermal-to-visible face recognition approach based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) with support vector machines (SVMs). We first subdivide the face into non-overlapping spatial regions or blocks using a method based on coalitional game theory. For comparison purposes, we also investigate uniform spatial subdivisions. Following this subdivision, histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) features are extracted from each block and utilized to compute a kernel for each region. We apply sparse multiple kernel learning (SMKL), which is a MKLbased approach that learns a set of sparse kernel weights, as well as the decision function of a one-vs-all SVM classifier for each of the subjects in the gallery. We also apply equal kernel weights (non-sparse) and obtain one-vs-all SVM models for the same subjects in the gallery. Only visible images of each subject are used for MKL training, while thermal images are used as probe images during testing. With subdivision generated by game theory, we achieved Rank-1 identification rate of 50.7% for SMKL and 93.6% for equal kernel weighting using a multimodal dataset of 65 subjects. With uniform subdivisions, we achieved a Rank-1 identification rate of 88.3% for SMKL, but 92.7% for equal kernel weighting. © 2014 SPIE.},

abstract={Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT) studies problems at the interface between computer science and microeconomics. Research in this area typically attacks very general settings using theoretical tools. There are great advantages to such an approach: in particular, the field has amassed an impressive range of sweeping impossibility, optimality, and approximation results. However, sometimes it is very difficult to obtain a clean theoretical result that addresses a complex, real-world problem of interest. We can often say more about realistic problems if we're willing to be pragmatic. In particular, progress can often be made by leveraging one or both of the following forms of pragmatism: 1. Aiming to achieve good performance only on problems of interest, rather than in relatively unconstrained settings; and 2. Working with statistical rather than analytical tools, thereby defining problems of interest implicitly via a dataset and/or appealing to data-driven measures of performance. This talk will survey three broad problems that I have attacked using such pragmatic approaches in my own research. (There is, of course, a wide range of excellent work in this vein by others; however, surveying it is beyond the scope of this talk.) First, a central problem in AGT is reasoning about equilibrium behavior in games. A seminal result was that the identification of a sample Nash equilibrium is PPAD-complete even in two-player games, meaning that the problem is probably intractable in the worst case. However, it is nevertheless often still possible to reason about games of interest, because they often exhibit various structural regularities. I'll describe the Action Graph Game (AGG) formalism, and explain how restricting ourselves to games that are compact in this (general) language yields exponential performance improvements. AGGs are particularly interesting for AGT researchers because they can compactly model messy, realistic mechanisms like advertising auctions or voting systems. I'll discuss what can be gained by analyzing such mechanisms in this way, and introduce some general tools that researchers can use to easily leverage these techniques in their own work. A second problem at the core of AGT is market design. I'll focus here on the FCC's upcoming 'incentive auction', in which television broadcasters will be given the opportunity to sell their broadcast rights, remaining broadcasters will be repacked into a smaller block of spectrum, and the freed airwaves will be resold to telecom companies. The stakes for this auction are huge'projected tens of billions of dollars in revenue for the government'justifying the design of a special-purpose descending-price auction mechanism, which I'll describe. An inner-loop problem in this mechanism is determining whether a given set of broadcasters can be repacked into a smaller block of spectrum while respecting radio interference constraints. This is an instance of a (worst-case intractable) graph coloring problem; however, stations' broadcast locations and interference constraints are all known in advance. I'll explain how this information can be leveraged by machine learning methods to obtain a SAT-based algorithm that can very quickly solve nearly all repacking problems encountered in practice. Finally, I'll briefly discuss Kudu, a market for agricultural commodities that my collaborators and I have built to help smallhold farmers in Uganda. © 2014 Author.},

abstract={As recently seen in Google's Gmail, the messages in inbox are classified into primary, social and promotions, which makes it easy for the users to differentiate the messages which they are looking for from the bulk of messages. Similarly, a users wall in facebook is usually flooded with huge amount of data which makes it annoying for the users to view the important news feeds among the rest. Thus we aim to focuses on classification of facebook news feeds. In this paper, we attempt to classify the users news feeds into various categories using classifiers to provide a better representation of data on users wall. News feeds collected from facebook are dynamically classified into various classes such as friends posts and liked pages posts. Friends posts are further categorized into life events posts and entertainment posts. Posts or updates from pages which are liked by the users are grouped as liked pages posts. Posts from friends are tagged as friends posts and those regarding the events occurring in their lives are said to be life event posts and the rest are tagged as entertainment posts. This helps users to find 'important news feeds' from 'live news feeds'. Sentiments are important as they depict the opinions and expressions of the user. Hence, detecting the sentiments of users from the life event posts also becomes an essential task. We also propose a system for automatic detection of sentiments from the life event posts and categorize based on sentiments into happy, neutral and bad feelings posts. This paper looks towards applying the classification methods from the literature to our dataset with the objective of evaluating methods of automatic news feeds classification and sentiment analysis which in future can provide facebook page a well organized and more appealing look. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper presents a dataset of body-sensor traces and cor- responding videos from several professional soccer games captured in late 2013 at the Alfheim Stadium in Tromsø, Norway. Player data, including field position, heading, and speed are sampled at 20Hz using the highly accurate ZXY Sport Tracking system. Additional per-player statistics, like total distance covered and distance covered in different speed classes, are also included with a 1Hz sampling rate. The pro- vided videos are in high-definition and captured using two stationary camera arrays positioned at an elevated position above the tribune area close to the center of the field. The camera array is configured to cover the entire soccer field, and each camera can be used individually or as a stitched panorama video. This combination of body-sensor data and videos enables computer-vision algorithms for feature ex- traction, object tracking, background subtraction, and similar, to be tested against the ground truth contained in the sensor traces.},

abstract={Human action recognition using depth sensors is an emerging technology especially in game console industry. Depth information can provide robust features about 3D environments and increase accuracy of action recognition in short ranges. This paper presents an approach to recognize basic human actions using depth information obtained from the Kinect sensor. To recognize actions, features extracted from angle and displacement information of joints are used. Actions are classified using support vector machines and random forest (RF) algorithm. The model is tested on HUN-3D, MSRC-12, and MSR Action 3D datasets with various testing approaches and obtained promising results especially with the RF algorithm. The proposed approach produces robust results independent from the dataset with simple and computationally cheap features. © 2014 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Many learning situations involve learning the conditional distribution when the training instances are drawn from the training distribution ptr(x), even though it will later be used to predict for instances drawn from a different test distribution pte(x). Most current approaches fo-cus on learning how to reweigh the training examples, to make them resemble the test distribu-tion. However, reweighing does not always help, because (we show that) the test error also de-pends on the correctness of the underlying model class. This paper analyses this situation by view-ing the problem of learning under changing distributions as a game between a learner and an ad-versary. We characterize when such reweighing is needed, and also provide an algorithm, robust covariate shift adjustment (RCSA), that provides relevant weights. Our empirical studies, on UCI datasets and a real-world cancer prognostic prediction dataset, show that our analysis applies, and that our RCSA works effectively.

abstract={Extracting significant features from high-dimension and small sample size biological data is a challenging problem. Recently, Michał Draminski proposed the Monte Carlo feature selection (MC) algorithm, which was able to search over large feature spaces and achieved better classification accuracies. However in MC the information of feature rank variations is not utilized and the ranks of features are not dynamically updated. Here, we propose a novel feature selection algorithm which integrates the ideas of the professional tennis players ranking, such as seed players and dynamic ranking, into Monte Carlo simulation. Seed players make the feature selection game more competitive and selective. The strategy of dynamic ranking ensures that it is always the current best players to take part in each competition. The proposed algorithm is tested on 8 biological datasets. Results demonstrate that the proposed method is computationally efficient, stable and has favorable performance in classification. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Although what drives the abundance and habitat selection of ungulates is a long-standing question, coherent datasets investigating the influences of rainfall, competition and fire on ungulates are unusual. Over 4 y we carried out extensive monthly road transects in Ithala Game Reserve, South Africa, to determine the demographics and habitat occupancy of the region's prevalent grazer (wildebeest) and mixed-feeder (impala). Habitat occupancy was determined using a GIS-based approach. We obtained 8742 sighting records, encompassing 8400 wildebeest and 10071 impala. Annual rainfall did not significantly correlate with population sizes of either species. Fecundity of wildebeest, but not of impala, showed a significant positive relationship with rainfall specifically over the perinatal period (November-December), whilst no significant relationships were found for either species between fecundity and rainfall over the previous year, 2 y, rut (February-April) or height of the dry season (June-August). Impala unexpectedly favoured browse habitats to grassland year round, probably consequent on competition for grass with wildebeest. Dry-season grass flushes attracted both wildebeest and impala. The study emphasized how rainfall, competition and fire regimes may affect differently grazers compared with mixed-feeders. © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

abstract={Modern smartphones permit to run a large variety of applications, i.e. multimedia, games, social network applications, etc. However, this aspect considerably reduces the battery life of these devices. A possible solution to alleviate this problem is to offload part of the application or the whole computation to remote servers, i.e. Cloud Computing. The offloading cannot be performed without considering the issues derived from the nature of the application (i.e. multimedia, games, etc.), which can considerably change the resources necessary to the computation and the type, the frequency and the amount of data to be exchanged with the network. This work shows a framework for automatically building models for the offloading of mobile applications based on evolutionary algorithms and how it can be used to simulate different kinds of mobile applications and to analyze the rules generated. To this aim, a tool for generating mobile datasets, presenting different features, is designed and experiments are performed in different usage conditions in order to demonstrate the utility of the overall framework. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.},

abstract={Tourism is one of the major drivers of the Greek economy. The contribution of tourism to the Greek economy has proved especially relevant during the period of the credit and Euro crises with a high budgetary and balance of payment deficits. From that perspective, this study examines the impact of the socio-economic and geographical determinants of foreign tourism demand in Greece. For the empirical analysis, a panel dataset of 31 countries is used over the period 2001-2010. The panel data estimation indicates that distance and trade have more explanatory power than relative prices and other determinants such as transport infrastructure. Income is statistically significant in three out of the eight specifications. Also, political stability seems to play an important role in tourism demand. The results are mixed for the competitive prices between Greece and its main tourism competitors. An interesting finding is that the Olympic Games of 2004 seem to have had a negative impact on international tourist arrivals in Greece in that year. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={Stimuli obtained from highly dynamic 3D virtual environments and synchronous eye-tracking data are commonly used by algorithms that strive to correlate gaze to scene objects, a process referred to as gaze-to-object mapping (GTOM). We propose to address this problem with a probabilistic approach using Bayesian inference. The desired result of the inference is a predicted probability density function (PDF) specifying for each object in the scene a probability to be attended by the user. To evaluate the quality of a predicted attention PDF, we present a methodology to assess the information value (i.e., likelihood) in the predictions of different approaches that can be used to infer object attention. To this end, we propose an experiment based on a visual search task, which allows us to determine the object of attention at a certain point in time under controlled conditions. We perform this experiment with a wide range of static and dynamic visual scenes to obtain a ground-truth evaluation dataset, allowing us to assess GTOM techniques in a set of 30 particularly challenging cases. © 2014 ACM.},

Collaborative filtering is one of the most important methods in recommender systems which predicts ratings for active user based on opinions and interests of other users who are similar to the active user. Accuracy of ratings prediction can be considerably improved using trust statements between users in recommender systems. In this paper, a novel method is proposed to determine effectiveness coefficient of the users in trust network of the active user. For this purpose, the Pareto dominance concept is used to identify dominance users of the active user and the trust statements between users are calculated based on this concept. Experimental results on Epinions dataset show that the proposed method improve accuracy of ratings prediction while provide suitable coverage rather than several well-known state-of-the-art methods. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Using mobile phone records and information theory measures, our daily lives have been recently shown to follow strict statistical regularities, and our movement patterns are, to a large extent, predictable. Here, we apply entropy and predictability measures to two datasets of the behavioral actions and the mobility of a large number of players in the virtual universe of a massive multiplayer online game. We find that movements in virtual human lives follow the same high levels of predictability as offline mobility, where future movements can, to some extent, be predicted well if the temporal correlations of visited places are accounted for. Time series of behavioral actions show similar high levels of predictability, even when temporal correlations are neglected. Entropy conditional on specific behavioral actions reveals that in terms of predictability, negative behavior has a wider variety than positive actions. The actions that contain the information to best predict an individual's subsequent action are negative, such as attacks or enemy markings, while the positive actions of friendship marking, trade and communication contain the least amount of predictive information. These observations show that predicting behavioral actions requires less information than predicting the mobility patterns of humans for which the additional knowledge of past visited locations is crucial and that the type and sign of a social relation has an essential impact on the ability to determine future behavior. © 2014 by the authors.},

abstract={This paper introduces the voice emotion recognition part of our framework for improving learning through webcams and microphones (FILTWAM). This framework enables multimodal emotion recognition of learners during game-based learning. The main goal of this study is to validate the use of microphone data for a real-time and adequate interpretation of vocal expressions into emotional states were the software is calibrated with end users. FILTWAM already incorporates a valid face emotion recognition module and is extended with a voice emotion recognition module. This extension aims to provide relevant and timely feedback based upon learner’s vocal intonations. The feedback is expected to enhance learner’s awareness of his or her own behavior. Six test persons received the same computer-based tasks in which they were requested to mimic specific vocal expressions. Each test person mimicked 82 emotions, which led to a dataset of 492 emotions. All sessions were recorded on video. An overall accuracy of our software based on the requested emotions and the recognized emotions is a pretty good 74.6% for the emotions happy and neutral emotions; but will be improved for the lower values of an extended set of emotions. In contrast with existing software our solution allows to continuously and unobtrusively monitor learners’ intonations and convert these intonations into emotional states. This paves the way for enhancing the quality and efficacy of game-based learning by including the learner’s emotional states, and links these to pedagogical scaffolding. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={The authors present a simulation-based ultrasonographic (US) training tool that can help improve the understanding of spatial relationships in US. Use of a game controller to simulate a US probe allows examination of different virtual three-dimensional (3D) objects. These 3D objects are either completely artificial simple geometric objects (eg, spheres, tubes, and ellipsoids, or more complex combinations thereof) or derived from photographed gross anatomic data (eg, the Visible Human dataset [U.S. National Library of Medicine]) or clinical computed tomographic (CT) data. The virtual US probe allows infinitely variable real-time positioning of a “slice” that is displayed as a two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional image and as part of a 3D view. Combining the 2D and 3D views helps elucidate the spatial relationships between a 3D object and derived 2D images. This training tool provides reliable real-time interactivity and is widely available and easily affordable, since it utilizes standard personal computer technology and off-the-shelf gaming hardware. For instance, it can be used at home by medical students or residents as a complement to conventional US training. In the future, this system could be adapted to support training for US-guided needle biopsy, with use of a second game controller to control the biopsy needle. Furthermore, it could be used as a more general interactive visualization tool for the evaluation of clinical 3D CT and magnetic resonance imaging data, allowing efficient and intuitive real-time creation of oblique multiplanar reformatted images.

abstract={Background In sport injury epidemiology research, the injury incidence rate (IR) is defined as the number of injuries over a given length of participation time (exposure, eg, game hours). However, it is common that individual weekly exposure is missing due to requirements of personnel at every game to record exposure information. Ignoring this issue will lead to an inflated injury rate because the total exposure serves as the denominator of IR, where the number of injury cases were captured accurately. Purpose This paper used data collected from a large community cohort study in youth ice hockey as an example, and compared six methods to handle missing weekly exposure of individual players. Methods The six methods to handle missing weekly exposures include available case analysis, last observation carried forward, mean imputation, multiple imputation, bootstrapping and best/worst case analysis. To estimate injury rate ratios (IRRs) between Alberta and Quebec, as in the original study, three statistical models were applied to the imputed datasets: Poisson, zeroinflated Poisson and negative binomial regression models. Results The final sample for imputation included 2098 players for whom 12.5% of weekly game hours were missing. Estimated IRs and IRRs with CIs from different imputation methods were similar when the proportion of missing was small. Simulations showed that mean and multiple imputations provide the least biased estimates of IRR when the proportion of missing was large. Conclusions Complicated methods, like multiple imputation or bootstrap, are not superior over the mean imputation, a much simpler method, in handling missing weekly exposure of injury data where exposures were missing at random.},

abstract={As stereoscopic display devices become common, their image quality assessment evaluation becomes increasingly important. Most studies conducted on 3D displays are based on psychophysics experiments with humans rating their experience based on detection tasks. The physical measurements do not map to effects on signal detection performance. Additionally, human observer study results are often subjective and difficult to generalize. We designed a computational stereoscopic observer approach inspired by the mechanisms of stereopsis in human vision for task-based image assessment that makes binary decisions based on a set of image pairs. The stereo-observer is constrained to a left and a right image generated using a visualization operator to render voxel datasets. We analyze white noise and lumpy backgrounds using volume rendering techniques. Our simulation framework generalizes many different types of model observers including existing 2D and 3D observers as well as providing flexibility to formulate a stereo model observer approach following the principles of stereoscopic viewing. This methodology has the potential to replace human observer studies when exploring issues with stereo display devices to be used in medical imaging. We show results quantifying the changes in performance when varying stereo angle as measured by an ideal linear stereoscopic observer. Our findings indicate that there is an increase in performance of about 13-18% for white noise and 20-46% for lumpy backgrounds, where the stereo angle is varied from 0 to 30. The applicability of this observer extends to stereoscopic displays used for in the areas of medical and entertainment imaging applications. © 2014 Optical Society of America.},

abstract={Due to technical advances in mobile devices (e.g., smart- phones, tablets) and wireless communications, people now can easily capture user-generated videos (UGVs) anywhere, anytime and instantly share their real-life experiences via social web sites. Enjoying videos has become very popular entertainment. One challenge is that many mobile videos do not have very appealing audio that was captured with the video. In this demonstration, to overcome this issue we propose a music video generation/creation system (Android app and backend system) that aims to make UGVs more attractive by generating scene-adaptive and user-preference aware music tracks. In our system, we take geographic cat- egories, visual content and user listening history into ac- count. In particular, the sequences of geographic categories and visual features are integrated into a SVMhmm model to predict video scene moods. The music genre, as a user preference is also exploited to personalize the recommended songs. We believe this is the first work that predicts scene moods from a real-world video dataset collected by users' daily outdoor recordings to facilitate user-preference aware music video generation. Our experiments confirm that our system can effectively combine objective scene moods and individual music tastes to recommend appealing soundtracks for videos. Our Android app only sends recorded sensor data and a few keyframes of a UGV to a cloud service (backend system) to retrieve recommended music tracks, therefore it is bandwidth efficient since the transmission of video data is not required for analysis.

abstract={In this work, we propose a new method to find homogeneous object groups in a single vertex-labeled graph. The basic premise is that many prevalent datasets consist of multiple types of information: graph data to represent the relations between objects and attribute data to characterize the single objects. Analyzing both information types simultaneously can increase the expressiveness of the resulting patterns. Our patterns of interest are sets of objects that are densely connected within the associated graph and as well show high similarity regarding their attributes. As for attribute data it is known that full-space clustering often is futile, we have to analyze the similarity of objects regarding subsets of their attributes. In order to take full advantage of all present information, we combine the paradigms of dense subgraph mining and subspace clustering. For our approach, we face several challenges to achieve a sound combination of the two paradigms. We maximize our twofold clusters according to their density, size, and number of relevant dimensions. The optimization of these three objectives usually is conflicting; thus, we realize a trade-off between these characteristics to obtain meaningful patterns. We develop a redundancy model to confine the clustering to a manageable size by selecting only the most interesting clusters for the result set. We prove the complexity of our clustering model and we particularly focus on the exploration of various pruning strategies to design the efficient algorithm GAMer (Graph & Attribute Miner). In thorough experiments on synthetic and real world data we show that GAMer achieves low runtimes and high clustering qualities. We provide all datasets, measures, executables, and parameter settings on our website http://dme.rwth-aachen.de/gamer. © 2013 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={While coups drive a majority of regime changes and are responsible for the overthrow of many democratic governments, there has been very little empirical work on the subject. Seizing Power develops a new theory of coup dynamics and outcomes, drawing upon 300 hours of interviews with coup participants and an original dataset of 471 coup attempts worldwide from 1950 to 2000. Naunihal Singh delivers a concise and empirical evaluation, arguing that understanding the dynamics of military factions is essential to predicting the success or failure of coups. Singh draws on an aspect of game theory known as a coordination game to explain coup dynamics. He finds a strong correlation between successful coups and the ability of military actors to project control and the inevitability of success. Using Ghana’s multiple coups as well as the 1991 coup attempt in the USSR, Singh shows how military actors project an image of impending victory that is often more powerful than the reality on the ground. Singh tests his coordination theory by analyzing ten coups in Ghana from 1967 to 1981. In the process he identifies three distinct points of origination: coups from top military offices, coups from the middle ranks, and mutinous coups from low-level soldiers. Singh’s theory will provide scholars with insight into the dynamics of authoritarian regimes, democratic transitions, and political instability. Seizing Power will appeal to scholars and students of civil-military relations, democracy transition studies, and the politics of Africa. © 2014 Johns Hopkins University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The explosive use of social media also makes it a popular platform for malicious users, known as social spammers, to overwhelm normal users with unwanted content. One effective way for social spammer detection is to build a classifier based on content and social network information. However, social spammers are sophisticated and adaptable to game the system with fast evolving content and network patterns. First, social spammers continually change their spamming content patterns to avoid being detected. Second, reflexive reciprocity makes it easier for social spammers to establish social influence and pretend to be normal users by quickly accumulating a large number of "human" friends. It is challenging for existing anti-spamming systems based on batch-mode learning to quickly respond to newly emerging patterns for effective social spammer detection. In this paper, we present a general optimization framework to collectively use content and network information for social spammer detection, and provide the solution for efficient online processing. Experimental results on Twitter datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. Copyright © 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.},

abstract={We introduce an example-based rigging approach to automatically generate linear blend skinning models with skeletal structure. Based on a set of example poses, our approach can output its skeleton, joint positions, linear blend skinning weights, and corresponding bone transformations. The output can be directly used to set up skeleton-based animation in various 3D modeling and animation software as well as game engines. Specifically, we formulate the solving of a linear blend skinning model with a skeleton as an optimization with joint constraints and weight smoothness regularization, and solve it using an iterative rigging algorithm that (i) alternatively updates skinning weights, joint locations, and bone transformations, and (ii) automatically prunes redundant bones that can be generated by an over-estimated bone initialization. Due to the automatic redundant bone pruning, our approach is more robust than existing example-based rigging approaches. Furthermore, in terms of rigging accuracy, even with a single set of parameters, our approach can soundly outperform state of the art methods on various types of experimental datasets including humans, quadrupled animals, and highly deformable models.

abstract={This paper examines the role of social learning in household enrollment decisions for the New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) in rural China by estimating a static game with incomplete information. Using a rich dataset from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we find that a 10-percentage-point increase in the enrollment rate in a village increases one's take-up probability by 5 percentage points. Using multiple model specifications, we show that the estimated social effects are not driven by simultaneity or common unobserved factors but are consistent with the hypothesis of social learning. We also find that the importance of social effects decreases significantly with households' familiarity with the NCMS as well as with the development of alternative information channels, which further ascertains that the primary mechanism for the social effects is social learning. The evidence suggests that healthier, wealthier, relatively well-educated, older Han male household heads tend to be opinion leaders. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

One primary basis for this came from a painstaking code comparison, using the source code of Fruit and the object code of Rybka, which found the selection of evaluation features in the programs to be almost the same, much more than expected by chance. In his brief defense, Rajlich indicated his opinion that move similarity testing was a superior method of detecting misappropriated entries. Later commentary by both Rajlich and his defenders reiterated the same, and indeed the ICGA Rules themselves specify move similarity as an example reason for why the tournament director would have warrant to request a source code examination.We report on data obtained from move-similarity testing. The principal dataset here consists of over 8000 positions and nearly 100 independent engines. We comment on such issues as: the robustness of the methods (upon modifying the experimental conditions), whether strong engines tend to play more similarly than weak ones, and the observed Fruit/Rybka move-similarity data. © 2013 International Federation for Information Processing.},

This information can be sensitive and allow for identifying a user profile, thus causing potential threats to a user's privacy. Our work shows that diagnostic information that is not considered sensitive, could be used to identify a user after just three consecutive days of monitoring. We have used the Device Analyzer dataset to determine what features of a mobile device are important in identifying a user. Many mobile games and applications collect diagnostic data as a means of identifying or resolving issues. Diagnostic data is commonly accepted as less sensitive information. Our experimental results demonstrate that using only diagnostic features like hardware statistics and system settings, a user's device can be identified at an accuracy of 94% with a Naive Bayes classifier.

abstract={Mapping the motion of an actor's face to a virtual model is a difficult but important problem, especially as fully animated characters are becoming more common in games and movies. Many methods have been proposed but most require the source and target to be structurally similar. Optical motion capture markers and blend-shape weights are an example of topologically incongruous source and target examples that do not have a simple mapping between one another. In this paper, we created a system capable of determining this mapping through supervised learning of a small training dataset. Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs) have been used for retargeting markers to blendshape weights before but to our knowledge Multi-Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks (referred to as ANNs) have not been employed in this way. We hypothesized that ANNs would result in a superior retargeting solution compared to the RBFN, due to their theoretically greater representational power. We implemented a retargeting system using ANNs and RBFNs for comparison. Our results found that both systems produced similar results (figure 1) and in some cases the ANN proved to be more expressive although the ANN was more difficult to work with. Copyright © ACM.},

We conducted a meta-analysis of human immunity to polio infections using multiple non-linear regression, and built a database from a broad (but not systematic) set of polio vaccine studies (46 studies, >10. 000 subjects). Results: The outcome was an immunological model representative of many different datasets. Parameters measured immunogenicity to both humoral and mucosal immune compartments for Salk and Sabin vaccines. The immunity model was more highly correlated with the data than a simpler per-dose efficacy model. Conclusions: The model offers new insights for immunization policy. We measured the mucosal immunogenicity of IPV to a precision that is useful in decision-making for end-game polio immunization policies. © 2013 The Authors.},

Effective and efficient identification of these facts assists journalists in reporting, one of the main goals of computational journalism. Technically, we consider an ever-growing table of objects with dimension and measure attributes. A situational fact is a 'contextual' skyline tuple that stands out against historical tuples in a context, specified by a conjunctive constraint involving dimension attributes, when a set of measure attributes are compared. New tuples are constantly added to the table, reflecting events happening in the real world. Our goal is to discover constraint-measure pairs that qualify a new tuple as a contextual skyline tuple, and discover them quickly before the event becomes yesterday's news. A brute-force approach requires exhaustive comparison with every tuple, under every constraint, and in every measure subspace. We design algorithms in response to these challenges using three corresponding ideas - tuple reduction, constraint pruning, and sharing computation across measure subspaces. We also adopt a simple prominence measure to rank the discovered facts when they are numerous. Experiments over two real datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our techniques. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Clustering is an important unsupervised learning approach and widely used in pattern recognition, data mining and image processing, etc. Different from existing clustering algorithms based on partitioning within data, dominant sets clustering extracts clusters in a sequential fashion. Based on graph-theoretic concept of a cluster, dominant sets clustering can be accomplished with a game dynamics efficiently while being able to determine the number of clusters automatically. However, we have observed that the definition of dominant set over weights the importance of high intra-cluster similarity. Consequently, dominant sets clustering is found to be sensitive to similarity parameters and show the tendency to generate over-segmented clustering results. In order to solve these problems, in this paper we present a cluster extension algorithm by making use of the relationship of intra-cluster and inter-cluster similarity. In experiments on eight datasets, our algorithm performs evidently better than the original dominant sets algorithm, and comparably to other state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. © 2014 IEEE.},

A support vector machine (SVM) is used as the discriminative model and a Discrete Multiple Bernoulli Relevance Model (DMBRM) is used as the generative model. The idea of combining both the models is to take advantage of the distinct capabilities of each model. The SVM tries to address the problem of poor annotation (images are not annotated with all relevant keywords), while the DMBRM model tries to address the problem of data imbalance (large variations in number of positive samples). Since DMBRM does not work well with high-dimensional data, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model is used to reduce the dimensionality of vector quantized features before using it. The hybrid model's results are comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art results on three standard datasets: Corel-5k, ESP-Game and IAPRTC-12. Copyright 2014 ACM.},

abstract={The need to encourage future generations of students in the pursuit of scientific research has been viewed as a cornerstone of US R&D efforts. However, few indicators of student intellectual activity at the graduate level are tracked on an ongoing basis. The aim of this paper is to examine graduate student publishing as an indicator of pre-doctoral research activity and future scholarly success. This study addresses the gap in knowledge about student publishing through a distinctive dataset that merges bibliometric publication data with survey data from a study of academic scientists. These data are from a nationally representative sample (n=1598) of scientists employed in Research I institutions. For each survey respondent, we have compiled a lifetime publication record from the Web of Science, Science Citation Index. The results indicate that the share of students with at least one publication is substantial and growing over time. Co-publication with advisors is found to be an important driving factor in publication activity, along with certain demographic and field characteristics. Our analysis also suggests that graduate student publication and collaboration are predictors of later career success and productivity, and as such an important tool in evaluating graduate programs. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The broad deployment of wearable camera technology in the foreseeable future offers new opportunities for augmented reality applications ranging from consumer (e.g. games) to professional (e.g. assistance). In order to span this wide scope of use cases, a markerless object detection and disambiguation technology is needed that is robust and can be easily adapted to new scenarios. Further, standardized benchmarking data and performance metrics are needed to establish the relative success rates of different detection and disambiguation methods designed for augmented reality applications. Here, we propose a novel object recognition system that fuses state-of-the-art 2D detection with 3D context. We focus on assisting a maintenance worker by providing an augmented reality overlay that identifies and disambiguates potentially repetitive machine parts. In addition, we provide an annotated dataset that can be used to quantify the success rate of a variety of 2D and 3D systems for object detection and disambiguation. Finally, we evaluate several performance metrics for object disambiguation relative to the baseline success rate of a human. © 2014. The copyright of this document resides with its authors.},

Within these domains, in this paper we focus on the problem of predicting traffic congestion in urban environments caused by attendees leaving a Planned Special Events (PSE), such as a soccer game or a concert. The proposed approach consists of two steps. In the first one, we use the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm to predict congestions within the vicinity of the venue (e.g. a Stadion) based on the knowledge from past observed events. In the second step, we identify the road segments that are likely to show congestion due to PSEs and map our prediction to these road segments. To visualize the traffic trends and congestion behavior we learned and to allow Domain Experts to evaluate the situation we also provide a Google Earthbased GUI. The proposed solution has been experimentally proven to outperform current state of the art solutions by about 35% and thus it can successfully serve to reliably predict congestions due to PSEs. © 2014 by Knowledge Systems Institute Graduate School.},

A large dataset of Greek firms from various sectors is used, including economic and non-economic indices, to examine the role of several indicators and firm characteristics in economic performance. The period between 2002 and 2009 is covered, including both, years of economic boost (Olympic Games of 2004) and of severe decrease (current economic crisis), to highlight possible differentiations in firms' growth rates. Drawing on literature, a growth model relying on sales volume is developed, and statistically tested for its ability to interpret firm performance. Findings indicate financial 'health' (leverage and liquidity) as a critical interpreter of sales' growth. Apart from financial indicators, non-economic data such as firm size also seem to be a significant determinant of firm dynamics. Finally, by examining firm's orientation, we find that clearly export-oriented firms appear higher rates of growth. Copyright © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Our approach is data-driven, taking as input a set of user-defined metrics and reference training data, either synthetic or from video footage of real crowds. Given a simulation, we formulate the crowd analysis problem as an anomaly detection problem and exploit state-of-the-art outlier detection algorithms to address it. To that end, we introduce a new framework for the visual analysis of crowd simulations. Our framework allows us to capture potentially erroneous behaviors on a per-agent basis either by automatically detecting outliers based on individual evaluation metrics or by accounting for multiple evaluation criteria in a principled fashion using Principle Component Analysis and the notion of Pareto Optimality. We discuss optimizations necessary to allow real-time performance on large datasets and demonstrate the applicability of our framework through the analysis of simulations created by several widely-used methods, including a simulation from a commercial game. © 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2014 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

abstract={Animal body size is driven by habitat quality, food availability, and nutrition. Adult size can relate to birth weight, to length of the ontogenetic growth period, and/or to the rate of growth. Data requirements are high for studying these growth mechanisms, but large datasets exist for some game species. In North America, large harvest datasets exist for white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), but such data are collected under a variety of conditions and are generally dismissed for ecological research beyond local population and habitat management. We contend that such data are useful for studying the ecology of white-tailed deer growth and body size when analyzed at ordinal scale. In this paper, we test the response of growth rate to food availability by fitting a logarithmic equation that estimates growth rate only to harvest data from Fort Hood, Texas, and track changes in growth rate over time. Results of this ordinal scale model are compared to previously published models that include additional parameters, such as birth weight and adult weight. It is shown that body size responds to food availability by variation in growth rate. Models that estimate multiple parameters may not work with harvest data because they are prone to error, which renders estimates from complex models too variable to detect interannual changes in growth rate that this ordinal scale model captures. This model can be applied to harvest data, from which inferences about factors that influence animal growth and body size (e.g., habitat quality and nutritional availability) can be drawn. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={This paper improves on the Spinning Network (SPN) method, a novel forecasting technique, inspired by human memory which was recently developed by Huang and Sadek (2009). The improvement centers on the use of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm to assess the similarity between two given time series, instead of using the Euclidean Distance as was the case with the original SPN. Following this, the enhanced method (i.e., hereafter referred to as the DTW-SPN) is used to predict hourly traffic volumes at the Peace Bridge, an international border crossing connecting Western New York State in the U.S. and Southern Ontario in Canada. The performance of the DTW-SPN is then compared to that of three other forecasting methods, namely: (1) the original SPN (referred to as the Euclidean-SPN); (2) the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) method; and (3) Support Vector Regression (SVR). Both classified as well as non-classified datasets are utilized, with the classification made on the basis of the type of the day to which the data items belong (i.e. Mondays through Thursdays, Fridays, weekends, holidays, and game days). The results indicate that, in terms of the Mean Absolute Percent Error, the DTW-SPN performed the best for all data groups with the exception of the "game day" group, where SVR performed slightly better. From a computational efficiency standpoint, the SPN-type algorithms require runtime significantly lower than that for either SARIMA or SVR. The performance of the DTW-SPN was also quite acceptable even when the data was not classified, indicating the robustness of the proposed forecasting method in dealing with heterogeneous data. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The aim of this research is to investigate the effectiveness of increased personalization of search engine advertising in order to improve the consumer's online experience. We segregate keyphrases from a dataset covering thirty-three consecutive months from a major US retailer consisting of 7 million daily records of a real time keyword advertising campaign into three gender categories (male, female and neutral) each with two groups (branded and unbranded) term usage. Using ANOVA, we analyze the effect of gender and brand keyphrases on critical sponsored search performance metrics of impressions, clicks, cost-per-clicks, sales revenue, orders, items purchased and return on advertising. Research findings show that the combination of brand focus with the gender-orientation of keyphrases is a significant factor in predicting sponsored search performance and behavior. There are statistically significant variations in consumer behavior as measured by sponsored search metrics among the gender categories. Specifically, females are more attracted to the use of branded terms than males, perhaps due to the trust and customer loyalty generated by brand image. Our results establishes that positive brand reputation creates dramatic influence on consumer's loyalty over the brand and hence strongly affects their interests, activities and purchasing behavior in e-commerce environment. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Digital commodities are delivered worldwide through a Global Supply Chain Network of providers. These are usually interconnected via Local Supply Chain Networks, based around Internet Exchange Points, the physical places where most digital exchanges take place. Providers compete both for business and final customers, while cooperating the exchanges of information flows composing the digital commodities, to provide a complete, end to end, service to final users. A myriad of interconnection decisions form the connectivity's architecture of this Global Supply Chain Network, designing the rules of the business game played by the operators. This paper, using a dataset of interconnection protocols over 195 Internet Exchange Points across the World, focuses on the relationship between a provider's connectivity and clustering: the mutual connectivity among the operators this provider is connected to. The strategic relevance of this relationship between connectivity and clustering is clear: the better connected a provider is, the easier it is to deliver the digital commodities with high quality and low costs and, when the neighbours of a provider are less interconnected among themselves, it is easier, for the provider, to exert its bargaining power over them. We estimate an econometric model finding that the continental location of an Internet Exchange Point has a significant effect on the sign of the elasticity between clustering and connectivity. This indicates that Local Supply Chain Networks display significant differences in their clusters of integration, hierarchical organization and complexity, depending on whether they are based in Europe, North America or Rest of the World. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Several visual attention models have been proposed for describing eye movements over simple stimuli and tasks such as free viewing or visual search. Yet, to date, there exists no computational framework that can reliably mimic human gaze behavior in more complex environments and tasks such as urban driving. In addition, benchmark datasets, scoring techniques, and top-down model architectures are not yet well understood. In this paper, we describe new task-dependent approaches for modeling top-down overt visual attention based on graphical models for probabilistic inference and reasoning. We describe a dynamic Bayesian network that infers probability distributions over attended objects and spatial locations directly from observed data. Probabilistic inference in our model is performed over object-related functions that are fed from manual annotations of objects in video scenes or by state-of-the-art object detection/recognition algorithms. Evaluating over approximately 3 h (approximately 315 000 eye fixations and 12 000 saccades) of observers playing three video games (time-scheduling, driving, and flight combat), we show that our approach is significantly more predictive of eye fixations compared to: 1) simpler classifier-based models also developed here that map a signature of a scene (multimodal information from gist, bottom-up saliency, physical actions, and events) to eye positions; 2) 14 state-of-the-art bottom-up saliency models; and 3) brute-force algorithms such as mean eye position. Our results show that the proposed model is more effective in employing and reasoning over spatio-temporal visual data compared with the state-of-the-art. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The upcoming device-to-device (D2D) communication paradigm will be game-changing for content distribution among wireless users. In this work we ask the following question: Assuming that mobile device owners are connected with social ties in a social network graph and that such information can be extracted by a wireless operator, how can the operator leverage the social network ties for efficient data transport? We consider a set of content sessions, each with a source and a destination. For each session, the operator needs to find the path from source to destination that minimizes total communication cost. The communication cost between each pair of nodes is the transmission delay (time delay per transmitted bit) between nodes, thus reflecting bandwidth consumption for the operator per unit of transmitted bit. The D2D forwarding paradigm grants the freedom to each node across to the path to accept the incoming traffic and forward it further or not. We model the probability that a node accepts incoming traffic as a function of its social ties with other nodes and we require that the solution results in a minimum probability of content delivery to destination. The problem is formulated as a constrained minimum-cost one and it is solved by an algorithm based on a Lagrangian relaxation. The performance of the algorithm is tested with real datasets that are used to create the communication and social graphs. © VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach, Germany.},

abstract={Does transport accessibility influence how many elite sportspersons regions produce? Accessibility and remoteness research has proliferated in the era of geographic information systems (GIS), but seldom within sports research. Studies in Australia and the US reveal that sports talent is more likely to come from communities of less than 500,000, but more than 10,000 people, suggesting spatial accessibility effects. The Talent Tracker project has identified the junior region of origin for the 1,290 players who were drafted and played at least one game of senior Australian Football (AFL) in the period 1997-2010. Junior AFL participation data (13-18 year old males) for the same period is used to determine spatial measures of annual average 'talent yield' (draftees produced per junior participant). The results are matched with Accessibility/Remoteness Index of Australia (ARIA) data, which provides a measure of spatial accessibility via the road network, for all Statistical Local Areas in Australia. Limitations of the methods include possible areal errors through aggregation in both datasets. Statistical correlation results suggest an association between accessibility/remoteness and talent yield across the SLAs. Mapping outputs highlight particular problems for extremely remote locations. At a finer grain, the results produce a more intriguing picture of where the places are in Australia that have been over- and underproducing AFL players, raising further questions as to how transport may be an influential factor. The findings may help sports bodies better understand the necessary spatial conditions influencing both elite competition recruitment structures and access to elite coaching.},

abstract={We analyze the determinants of expansions and contractions of shopping centers using a unique dataset of property level data for shopping centers in eleven metropolitan areas over the period from 1995 through 2005. We find that shopping centers with large operating costs are less likely to expand and are more likely to contract. Higher expected revenue per square foot increases the likelihood of expansion and decreases the likelihood of contraction. For small shopping centers the decision to change gross leasable area (GLA) is largely driven by potential revenue, while the decision to change the number of stores is largely a function of cost. We find some support for Grenadier's theory that a larger number of competitors reduces the value of option to wait and increases the likelihood of both expansion and contraction. The market share of competitors reduces the likelihood of increasing the number of stores as suggested by the theory of strategic positioning. Our hypotheses best explain contraction decisions of large shopping centers and expansion decisions of small shopping centers. We find that both expansions and contractions of GLA are less likely for large shopping centers in MSAs with greater uncertainty about real estate prices, indicating that the option to delay has value. Moreover, small centers are significantly less sensitive to cost and revenue; since small centers are likely to have greater idiosyncratic risk than large; this provides indirect evidence for a significant delay option. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Nowadays, social networks are becoming tremendously popular and many people share their information in the networks with various goals. Generally, the information is published as pages. Whereas many pages are created in social networks, users can not find their favorite pages easily. In this paper, we introduce a new five-dimensional hybrid recommender system which combines collaborative, content-based and demographic filtering techniques and our proposed personalized PageRank. The five dimensions of our proposed system include social relation among users, user's profile, liked pages, events and groups which demonstrate users' attitudes. Hence, we recommend pages to a user in social networks by considering user's attitudes. We consider interests, activities, sex, age, education, work, favourite books, movies, music, sports, TV, athletes, teams, and games which are considered as user knowledge; moreover, social relation among users, liked pages, events and groups are taken into account as domain knowledge to model recommendations. The model attempts to alight influence of cold start problem and synonymy. Finally, the proposed model is applied on three real dataset of Facebook to evaluate and validate the accuracy of recommendations. The results reveal that the accuracy of pages recommendation is obtained as 91% by our proposed model. Copyright © 2014 IADIS Press All rights reserved.},

abstract={Context. Dust and stars play a complex game of interactions in the interstellar medium and around young stars. The imprints of these processes are visible in scaling relations between stellar characteristics, star formation parameters, and dust properties. Aims. In the present work, we aim to examine dust scaling relations on a sub-kpc resolution in the Andromeda galaxy (M31). The goal is to investigate the properties of M31 on both a global and local scale and compare them to other galaxies of the local universe. Methods. New Herschel observations are combined with available data from GALEX, SDSS, WISE, and Spitzer to construct a dataset covering UV to submm wavelengths. All images were brought to the beam size and pixel grid of the SPIRE 500 μm frame. This divides M31 in 22 437 pixels of 36 arcseconds in size on the sky, corresponding to physical regions of 137 × 608 pc in the galaxy's disk. A panchromatic spectral energy distribution was modelled for each pixel and maps of the physical quantities were constructed. Several scaling relations were investigated, focussing on the interactions of dust with starlight. Results. We find, on a sub-kpc scale, strong correlations between Mdust/M * and NUV-r, and between Mdust/M* and μ* (the stellar mass surface density). Striking similarities with corresponding relations based on integrated galaxies are found. We decompose M31 in four macro-regions based on their far-infrared morphology; the bulge, inner disk, star forming ring, and the outer disk region. In the scaling relations, all regions closely follow the galaxy-scale average trends and behave like galaxies of different morphological types. The specific star formation characteristics we derive for these macro-regions give strong hints of an inside-out formation of the bulge-disk geometry, as well as an internal downsizing process. Within each macro-region, however, a great diversity in individual micro-regions is found, regardless of the properties of the macro-regions. Furthermore, we confirm that dust in the bulge of M31 is heated only by the old stellar populations. Conclusions. In general, the local dust scaling relations indicate that the dust content in M31 is maintained by a subtle interplay of past and present star formation. The similarity with galaxy-based relations strongly suggests that they are in situ correlations, with underlying processes that must be local in nature. © ESO, 2014.},

abstract={Bioinformatics research relies heavily on the ability to discover and correlate data from various sources. The specialization of life sciences over the past decade, coupled with an increasing number of biomedical datasets available through standardized interfaces, has created opportunities towards new methods in biomedical discovery. Despite the popularity of semantic web technologies in tackling the integrative bioinformatics challenge, there are many obstacles towards its usage by non-technical research audiences. In particular, the ability to fully exploit integrated information needs using improved interactive methods intuitive to the biomedical experts. In this report we present ReVeaLD (a Real-time Visual Explorer and Aggregator of Linked Data), a user-centered visual analytics platform devised to increase intuitive interaction with data from distributed sources. ReVeaLD facilitates query formulation using a domain-specific language (DSL) identified by biomedical experts and mapped to a self-updated catalogue of elements from external sources. ReVeaLD was implemented in a cancer research setting; queries included retrieving data from in silico experiments, protein modeling and gene expression. ReVeaLD was developed using Scalable Vector Graphics and JavaScript and a demo with explanatory video is available at http://www.srvgal78.deri.ie:8080/explorer. A set of user-defined graphic rules controls the display of information through media-rich user interfaces. Evaluation of ReVeaLD was carried out as a game: biomedical researchers were asked to assemble a set of 5 challenge questions and time and interactions with the platform were recorded. Preliminary results indicate that complex queries could be formulated under less than two minutes by unskilled researchers. The results also indicate that supporting the identification of the elements of a DSL significantly increased intuitiveness of the platform and usability of semantic web technologies by domain users. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={This article studies the problem of prominent streak discovery in sequence data. Given a sequence of values, a prominent streak is a long consecutive subsequence consisting of only large (small) values, such as consecutive games of outstanding performance in sports, consecutive hours of heavy network traffic, and consecutive days of frequent mentioning of a person in social media. Prominent streak discovery provides insightful data patterns for data analysis in many real-world applications and is an enabling technique for computational journalism. Given its real-world usefulness and complexity, the research on prominent streaks in sequence data opens a spectrum of challenging problems. A baseline approach to finding prominent streaks is a quadratic algorithm that exhaustively enumerates all possible streaks and performs pairwise streak dominance comparison. For more efficient methods, we make the observation that prominent streaks are in fact skyline points in two dimensions-streak interval length and minimum value in the interval. Our solution thus hinges on the idea to separate the two steps in prominent streak discovery: candidate streak generation and skyline operation over candidate streaks. For candidate generation, we propose the concept of local prominent streak (LPS). We prove that prominent streaks are a subset of LPSs and the number of LPSs is less than the length of a data sequence, in comparison with the quadratic number of candidates produced by the brute-force baseline method. We develop efficient algorithms based on the concept of LPS. The nonlinear local prominent streak (NLPS)-based method considers a superset of LPSs as candidates, and the linear local prominent streak (LLPS)-based method further guarantees to consider only LPSs. The proposed properties and algorithms are also extended for discovering general top-k, multisequence, and multidimensional prominent streaks. The results of experiments using multiple real datasets verified the effectiveness of the proposed methods and showed orders of magnitude performance improvement against the baseline method. © 2014 ACM.},

abstract={Social networks have developed to maturity up to now. And Weibo submitted its initial public offerings (IPO) to U.S. securities and exchange commission (SEC) on March 15th 2014. However, spamming has been a long existing problem on the Internet, it has existed at the time of Web 1.0. With fast development of social networks, spamming problem emerged and became more complex in social network service. Spammers post feeds containing typical phrases of a trending topic and URLs that usually are uncorrelated with feeds content. These URLs will lead users to certain websites that usually are Taobao shop sites, so spammers can earn money. It is an urgent task to construct mechanisms to automaticly detect and stop spammers. Researches about this have been done. But because of the game between spammers and antispam systems, behavior parttens of spammers changes constantly. In this paper we present an adaptive framwork to detecting spammers dynamiclly by using incremental learning of machine learning algorithm. To access to the identification of spammers we analyze Weibo user behaviors systematically, and find different behavior parttens between spammers and legitimate users. To collect a large set of Weibo user samples, we apply for a high privilege developer account and devise an effective method using Weibo open platform. We collected a large dataset of Sina Weibo which includes 30 million users and 46 million feeds and 980 million links. By checking users' tweeting behaviors, we gathered training user samples including spammers and legitimate users manually. And then we compared characteristics of user social behaviors of spammers with legitimate users. These characteristics were used in our framwork to devide spammers from legitimate users. Through tests with real data it is proved that this approach can effectively identify the spammers in Weibo. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={The visual simulation of fluids has become an important element in many applications, such as movies and computer games. In these applications, large-scale fluid scenes, such as fire in a village, are often simulated by repeatedly rendering multiple small-scale fluid flows. In these cases, animators are requested to generate many variations of a small-scale fluid flow. This paper presents a method to help animators meet such requirements. Our method enables the user to generate flow field variations from a single simulated dataset obtained by fluid simulation. The variations are generated in both the frequency and spatial domains. Fluid velocity fields are represented using Laplacian eigenfunctions which ensure that the flow field is always incompressible. In generating the variations in the frequency domain, we modulate the coefficients (amplitudes) of the basis functions. To generate variations in the spatial domain, our system expands or contracts the simulation space, then the flow is calculated by solving a minimization problem subject to the resized velocity field. Using our method, the user can easily create various animations from a single dataset calculated by fluid simulation. 2013 Copyright held by the Owner/Author.},

abstract={The emergence of cooperation among unrelated human subjects is a long-standing conundrum that has been amply studied both theoretically and experimentally. Within the question, a less explored issue relates to the gender dependence of cooperation, which can be traced back to Darwin, who stated that "women are less selfish but men are more competitive". Indeed, gender has been shown to be relevant in several game theoretical paradigms of social cooperativeness, including prisoner's dilemma, snowdrift and ultimatum/dictator games, but there is no consensus as to which gender is more cooperative. We here contribute to this literature by analyzing the role of gender in a repeated Prisoners' Dilemma played by Spanish high-school students in both a square lattice and a heterogeneous network. While the experiment was conducted to shed light on the influence of networks on the emergence of cooperation, we benefit from the availability of a large dataset of more 1200 participants. We applied different standard econometric techniques to this dataset, including Ordinary Least Squares and Linear Probability models including random effects. All our analyses indicate that being male is negatively associated with the level of cooperation, this association being statistically significant at standard levels. We also obtain a gender difference in the level of cooperation when we control for the unobserved heterogeneity of individuals, which indicates that the gender gap in cooperation favoring female students is present after netting out this effect from other sociodemographics factors not controlled for in the experiment, and from gender differences in risk, social and competitive preferences. © 2013 Molina et al.},

abstract={Finding an optimal meeting point (OMP) for a group of people (or a set of objects) at different locations is an important problem in spatial query processing. There are many real-life applications related to this problem, such as determining the location of a conference venue, deciding the pick-up location of a tourist bus, and planing tactics of artificial intelligence in real-time strategy games. Formally, given a set {Mathematical expression} of query points in a spatial setting {Mathematical expression}, an OMP query fetches the point {Mathematical expression} that minimizes a cost function defined over the distances from {Mathematical expression} to all points in {Mathematical expression}. Since there are infinitely many locations in a given space setting, it is infeasible to examine all of them to find the OMP, and thus, the problem is challenging. In this paper, we study OMP queries in the following two spatial settings which are common in real-life applications: Euclidean space and road networks. In the setting of Euclidean space, we propose a general framework for answering all OMP query variants and also identify the best algorithms for particular types of OMP queries in the literature. In the setting of road networks, we study how to access only part of the road network and examine part of the candidates.

abstract={Increasingly, diverse online social networks are locally and globally interconnected by sharing information in the Web ecosystem. Accordingly, emergent macro-level phenomena have been observed, such as global spread of news across different types of social media. Such real-world diffusion is hard to define with a single social platform alone since dynamic influences between heterogeneous social networks are not negligible. Also, the underlying structural property of networks is important, as it drives the diffusion process in a stochastic way. In this paper, we propose a macro-level diffusion model with a probabilistic approach by combining both heterogeneity and structural connectivity of social networks. As real-world phenomena, we take cases from news diffusion across News, social networking sites (SNS), and Blog media using the ICWSM'11 Spinn3r dataset which contains over 386 million Web documents covering a one-month period in early 2011. We find that influence between different media types is varied by context of information. News media are the most influential in the Arts and Economy categories, while SNS and Blog media are in the Politics and Culture categories, respectively. Also, controversial topics such as political protests and multiculturalism failure tend to spread concurrently across social media, while entertainment topics such as film releases and celebrities are likely driven by internal interactions within single social platforms. We expect that the proposed model applies to a wider class of diffusion phenomena in diverse fields including the social sciences, marketing, and neuroscience, and that it provides a way of interpreting dynamics of meta-populations in terms of strength and directionality of influences among them.

abstract={Behavioral datasets from major commercial game titles of the 'AAA' grade generally feature high dimensionality and large sample sizes, from tens of thousands to millions, covering time scales stretching into several years of real-time, and evolving user populations. This makes dimensionality-reduction methods such as clustering and classification useful for discovering and defining patterns in player behavior. The goal from the perspective of game development is the formation of behavioral profiles that provide actionable insights into how a game is being played, and enables the detection of e.g. problems hindering player progression. Due to its unsupervised nature, clustering is notably useful in cases where no prior-defined classes exist. Previous research in this area has successfully applied clustering algorithms to behavioral datasets from different games. In this paper, the focus is on examining the behavior of 62,000 players from the major commercial game Tomb Raider: Underworld, as it unfolds from the beginning of the game and throughout the seven main levels of the game. Where previous research has focused on aggregated behavioral datasets spanning an entire game, or conversely a limited slice or snapshot viewed in isolation, this is to the best knowledge of the authors the first study to examine the application of clustering methods to player behavior as it evolves throughout an entire game. © 2013 IEEE.},

In this paper, we present a novel approach to human action recognition from 3D skeleton sequences extracted from depth data. We use the covariance matrix for skeleton joint locations over time as a discriminative descriptor for a sequence. To encode the relationship between joint movement and time, we deploy multiple covariance matrices over sub-sequences in a hierarchical fashion. The descriptor has a fixed length that is independent from the length of the described sequence. Our experiments show that using the covariance descriptor with an off-the-shelf classification algorithm outperforms the state of the art in action recognition on multiple datasets, captured either via a Kinect-type sensor or a sophisticated motion capture system. We also include an evaluation on a novel large dataset using our own annotation.},

abstract={Recommending products to consumers means not only understanding their tastes, but also understanding their level of experience. For example, it would be a mistake to recommend the iconic film Seven Samurai simply because a user enjoys other action movies; rather, we might conclude that they will eventually enjoy it-once they are ready. The same is true for beers, wines, gourmet foods-or any products where users have acquired tastes: the 'best' products may not be the most 'accessible'. Thus our goal in this paper is to recommend products that a user will enjoy now, while acknowledging that their tastes may have changed over time, and may change again in the future. We model how tastes change due to the very act of consuming more products-in other words, as users become more experienced. We develop a latent factor recommendation system that explicitly accounts for each user's level of experience. We find that such a model not only leads to better recommendations, but also allows us to study the role of user experience and expertise on a novel dataset of fifteen million beer, wine, food, and movie reviews.

This paper presents an approach based on the theory of noncooperative games to solve this problem. While group members can be seen as game players, the items for potential recommendation for the group comprise the set of possible actions. Achieving group satisfaction as a whole becomes, then, a problem of finding the Nash equilibrium. Experiments with a MovieLens dataset and a function of arithmetic mean to compute the prediction of group satisfaction for the generated recommendation have shown statistically significant results when compared to state-of-the-art aggregation strategies, in particular, when evaluation among group members are more heterogeneous. The feasibility of this unique approach is shown by the development of an application for Facebook, which recommends movies to groups of friends.},

We use HOD to describe the 3D trajectories of body joints to recognize human actions, which is a challenging machine vision task, with applications in human-robot/machine interaction, interactive entertainment, multimedia information retrieval, and surveillance.

abstract={Structuring is one of the fundamental activities needed to understand data. Human structuring activity lies behind many of the datasets found on the internet that contain grouped instances, such as file or email folders, tags and bookmarks, ontologies and linked data. Understanding the dynamics of large-scale structuring activities is a key prerequisite for theories of individual behaviour in collaborative settings as well as for applications such as recommender systems. One central question is to what extent the "structurer" - be it human or machine - is driven by his/its own prior structures, and to what extent by the structures created by others such as one's communities. In this paper, we propose a method for identifying these dynamics. The method relies on dynamic conceptual clustering, and it simulates an intellectual structuring process operating over an extended period of time. The development of a grouping of dynamically changing items follows a dynamically changing and collectively determined "guiding grouping". The analysis of a real-life dataset of a platform for literature management suggests that even in such a typical "Web 2.0" environment, users are guided somewhat more by their own previous behaviour than by their peers. Furthermore, we also illustrate how the presented method can be used to recommend structure to the user. © Springer-Verlag 2013.},

abstract={Group recommender systems usually provide recommendations to a fixed and predetermined set of members. In some situations, however, there is a set of people (N) that should be organized into smaller and cohesive groups, so it is possible to provide more efiective recommendations to each of them. This is not a trivial task. In this paper we propose an innovative approach for grouping people within the recommendation problem context. The problem is modeled as a coalitional game from Game Theory. The goal is to group people into exhaustive and disjoint coalitions so as to maximize the social welfare function of the group. The optimal coalition structure is that with highest summation over all social welfare values. Similarities between recommendation system users are used to define the social welfare function. We compare our approach with K-Means clustering for a dataset from Movielens. Results have shown that the proposed approach performs better than K-Means for both av-erage group satisfaction and Davies-Bouldin index metrics when the number of coalitions found is not greater than 4 (K < 4) for a population size of 12 (N = 12).},

We present different models relating to theories of human behavior and compare them to actual data collected during experiments on irrigation games with 80 individuals divided in 16 different groups. We run a total of 7 different models: from very simple ones involving 0 parameters (i.e., pure random, pure selfish and pure altruistic), to increasingly complex ones that include different type of agents, learning and other-regarding preferences. By comparing the different models we find that the most comprehensive model of human behavior behaves not far from an ad hoc model built on our dataset; remarkably we also find that a very simple model presenting a mix of random selfish and altruistic agents performs only slightly below the best performing models. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Aspect-based opinion mining from online reviews has attracted a lot of attention recently. The main goal of all of the proposed methods is extracting aspects and/or estimating aspect ratings. Recent works, which are often based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), consider both tasks simultaneously. These models are normally trained at the item level, i.e., a model is learned for each item separately. Learning a model per item is fine when the item has been reviewed extensively and has enough training data. However, in reallife datasets such as those from Epinions.com and Amazon.com more than 90% of items have less than 10 reviews, so-called cold start items. State-of-the-art LDA models for aspect-based opinion mining are trained at the item level and therefore perform poorly for cold start items due to the lack of sufficient training data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model based on LDA, called Factorized LDA (FLDA), to address the cold start problem. The underlying assumption of FLDA is that aspects and ratings of a review are influenced not only by the item but also by the reviewer. It further assumes that both items and reviewers can be modeled by a set of latent factors which represent their aspect and rating distributions. Different from state-of-the-art LDA models, FLDA is trained at the category level and learns the latent factors using the reviews of all the items of a category, in particular the non cold start items, and uses them as prior for cold start items. Our experiments on three real-life datasets demonstrate the improved effectiveness of the FLDA model in terms of likelihood of the held-out test set. We also evaluate the accuracy of FLDA based on two application-oriented measures. Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

abstract={Modeling realistic skin deformations due to underneath muscle bulging has a wide range of applications in medicine, entertainment and art. Current acquisition systems based on dense markers and multiple synchronized cameras are able to record and reproduce fine-scale skin deformations with sufficient quality. However, the complexity and the high cost of these systems severely limit their applicability. In this paper, we propose a method for reconstructing fine-scale arm muscle deformations using the Kinect depth camera. The captured data from the depth camera has no temporal contiguity and suffers from noise and sensory artifacts, and thus unsuitable by itself for potential applications in visual media production or biomechanics. We process noisy depth input to obtain spatio-temporally consistent 3D mesh reconstructions showing fine-scale muscle bulges over time. Our main contribution is the incorporation of statistical deformation priors into the spatiotemporal mesh registration progress. We obtain these priors from a previous dataset of a limited number of physiologically different actors captured using a high fidelity acquisition setup, and these priors help provide a better initialization for the ultimate non-rigid surface refinement that models deformations beyond the range of the previous dataset. Thus, our method is an easily scalable framework for bootstrapping the statistical muscle deformation model, by extending the set of subjects through a Kinect based acquisition process. We validate our spatio-temporal surface registration method on several arm movements performed by people of different body shapes. © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Privacy-preserving set intersection protocol is desirable for many practical applications. Malicious and semi-honest adversarial models in cryptographic settings have been considered mostly to design such protocols for privacy-preserving set intersection. In a semi-honest or malicious model an adversary is assumed to follow or arbitrarily deviate from the protocol, respectively. Protocols in semi-honest model can utilize cheaper cryptographic primitives, but that comes with a cost of weaker security. On the other hand, strong security is guaranteed by the malicious model whereby expensive cyptographic primitives are required. However, achieving a desired level of privacy with efficient computation is what we need for practical implementations. In this paper, we address the multiparty private set intersection problem using simple cryptographic primitives, in which each of the N parties learns no elements other than the intersection of their N private datasets. The private set intersection is constructed in game-theoretic model, where instead of being semi-honest or malicious the parties are viewed as rational and are assumed (only) to act in their own self-interest. We consider both single player deviation and coalitions, and show that our protocol satisfies computational strict Nash equilibrium. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={We consider an industrial strength application of recommendation systems for video-game matchmaking in which off-policy policy evaluation is important but where standard approaches can hardly be applied. The objective of the policy is to sequentially form teams of players from those waiting to be matched, in such a way as to produce well-balanced matches. Unfortunately, the available training data comes from a policy that is not known perfectly and that is not stochastic, making it impossible to use methods based on importance weights. Furthermore, we observe that when the estimated reward function and the policy are obtained by training from the same off-policy dataset, the policy evaluation using the estimated reward function is biased. We present a simple calibration procedure that is similar to stacked regression and that removes most of the bias, in the experiments we performed. Data collected during beta tests of Ghost Recon Online, a first person shooter from Ubisoft, were used for the experiments. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Machine based human action recognition has become very popular in the last decade. Automatic unattended surveillance systems, interactive video games, machine learning and robotics are only few of the areas that involve human action recognition. This paper examines the capability of a known transform, the so-called Trace, for human action recognition and proposes two new feature extraction methods based on the specific transform. The first method extracts Trace transforms from binarized silhouettes, representing different stages of a single action period. A final history template composed from the above transforms, represents the whole sequence containing much of the valuable spatio-temporal information contained in a human action. The second, involves Trace for the construction of a set of invariant features that represent the action sequence and can cope with variations usually appeared in video capturing. The specific method takes advantage of the natural specifications of the Trace transform, to produce noise robust features that are invariant to translation, rotation, scaling and are effective, simple and fast to create. Classification experiments performed on two well known and challenging action datasets (KTH and Weizmann) using Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel SVM provided very competitive results indicating the potentials of the proposed techniques. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Locating the transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), motif discovery, are crucial for understanding the gene regulatory relationship. This paper proposes a novel fixed-position projection refinement algorithm (FPPR) to identify the TFBS of DNA sequences. FPPR clusters DNA data into different subsets through a projection based on the corresponding probabilistic frequency matrix, and filters the subsets with certain information score and complexity which are used as the initial condition for expectation maximum refinement. FPPR achieves the different motif instances distribution in the model OOPS, ZOOPS and TCM by setting the threshold in the fixed-position projection. Meanwhile, FPPR can be extended to a multiple motifs discovery version by using the similarity function WIC. Experiments on the real datasets demonstrate our algorithm finds real motifs accurately in a proper time. Comparing with MEME, GAME, Motif Sampler and GALP-F, FPPR has the better performance, and it can solve the multiple motifs discovery effectively.},

abstract={We present a prop-based, tangible interface for 3D interactive visualization of thin fiber structures. These data are commonly found in current bioimaging datasets, for example second-harmonic generation microscopy of collagen fibers in tissue. Our approach uses commodity visualization technologies such as a depth sensing camera and low-cost 3D display. Unlike most current uses of these emerging technologies in the games and graphics communities, we employ the depth sensing camera to create a fish-tank stereoscopic virtual reality system at the scientist's desk that supports tracking of small-scale gestures with objects already found in the work space. We apply the new interface to the problem of interactive exploratory visualization of three-dimensional thin fiber data. A critical task for the visual analysis of these data is understanding patterns in fiber orientation throughout a volume. The interface enables a new, fluid style of data exploration and fiber orientation analysis by using props to provide needed passive-haptic feedback, making 3D interactions with these fiber structures more controlled. We also contribute a low-level algorithm for extracting fiber centerlines from volumetric imaging. The system was designed and evaluated with two biophotonic experts who currently use it in their lab. As compared to typical practice within their field, the new visualization system provides a more effective way to examine and understand the 3D bioimaging datasets they collect. © 1995-2012 IEEE.},

NovaEmötions is a multiplayer game where players score by acting an emotion through a facial expression. We designed an algorithm to offer an engaging interaction experience using the facial expression. Despite the novelty of the interaction method, our game scoring algorithm kept players engaged and competitive. A user study done with 46 users showed the success and potential for the usage of affective-based interaction in videogames, i.e., the facial expression as the sole controller in videogames. Moreover, we released a novel facial expression dataset with over 41,000 images. These face images were captured in a novel and realistic setting: users playing games where a player's facial expression has an impact on the game score. Copyright © 2013 ACM.},

abstract={Urban models are key to navigation, architecture and entertainment. Apart from visualizing facades, a number of tedious tasks remain largely manual (e.g. compression, generating new facade designs and structurally comparing facades for classification, retrieval and clustering). We propose a novel procedural modelling method to automatically learn a grammar from a set of facades, generate new facade instances and compare facades. To deal with the difficulty of grammatical inference, we reformulate the problem. Instead of inferring a compromising, one-size-fits-all, single grammar for all tasks, we infer a model whose successive refinements are production rules tailored for each task. We demonstrate our automatic rule inference on datasets of two different architectural styles. Our method supercedes manual expert work and cuts the time required to build a procedural model of a facade from several days to a few milliseconds. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Mining for cliques in networks provides an essential tool for the discovery of strong associations among entities. Applications vary, from extracting core subgroups in team performance data arising in sports, entertainment, research and business; to the discovery of functional complexes in high-throughput gene interaction data. A challenge in all of these scenarios is the large size of real-world networks and the computational complexity associated with clique enumeration. Furthermore, when mining for multiple cliques within the same network, the results need to be diversified in order to extract meaningful information that is both comprehensive and representative of the whole dataset. We formalize the problem of weighted diverse clique mining (mDKC) in large networks, incorporating both individual clique strength (measured by its weakest link) and diversity of the cliques in the result set. We show that the problem is NP-hard due to the diversity requirement. However, our formulation is sub-modular, and hence can be approximated within a constant factor from the optimal. We propose algorithms for mDKC that exploit the edge weight distribution in the input network and produce performance gains of more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to an exhaustive solution. One of our algorithms, Diverse Cliques (DiCliQ), guarantees a constant factor approximation while the other, Bottom Up Diverse Cliques (BUDiC), scales to large and dense networks without compromising the solution quality. We evaluate both algorithms on 5 real-world networks of different genres and demonstrate their utility for discovery of gene complexes and effective collaboration subgroups in sports and entertainment. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Many real-world social interactions involve multiple people, for e.g., authors collaborating on a paper, email exchanges made in a company and task-oriented teams in workforce. Simple graph representation of these activities destroys the group structure present in them. Hypergraphs have recently emerged as a better tool for modeling group interactions. However, methods in social hypernetwork analysis haven't kept pace. In this work, we extend the concept of node degree centrality to hypergraphs. We validate our proposed measures using alternate measures of influence available to us using two datasets namely, the DBLP dataset of scientific collaborations and the group network in a popular Chinese multi-player online game called CR3. We discuss several schemes for assigning weights to hyperedges and compare them empirically. Finally, we define separate weak and strong tie node degree centralities which improves performance of our models. Weak tie degree centrality is found to be a better predictor of influence in hypergraphs than strong tie degree centrality. © 2013 IEEE.},

On the basis of the literature, five enjoyment factors in SNGs, namely, emotion, control, immersion, social interaction and usability have been identified. The dataset comprised 100 randomly selected SNGs from a recommended list in Facebook. Enjoyment factors for each SNG were evaluated by a team of three coders while the popularity of each SNG was measured in terms of the number of Monthly Active Users reported in Facebook as of April 2012. The results from the regression analysis indicate that the five enjoyment factors collectively account for 54.80 % of variability in the popularity of SNGs. Furthermore, emotion, control and social interaction were significant antecedents of popularity. The paper concludes with a few limitations and offers some directions for future research. © 2013 IADIS.},

abstract={Feature selection plays an important role in text categorization. Term frequency and document frequency are commonly used measures in feature selection methods for text categorization. The term frequency provides document level information for a word while document frequency highlights dataset level information for a word. We introduced a Game-theoretic rough set based method for combining these measures in an effective and meaningful way. The method incorporates the measures as players in a game where each player employs a three-way decision in selecting features. The three-way decisions for features received inspiration from three-way decisions for classification of objects in rough sets. The selected decisions with respective measures are utilized in finding a corporative solution as in game-theoretic rough sets. A demonstrative example suggests that this method may be more efficient for feature selection in text categorization. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Compared to security surveillance and military applications, where automated action analysis is prevalent, the sports domain is extremely under-served. Most existing software packages for sports video analysis require manual annotation of important events in the video. American football is the most popular sport in the United States, however most game analysis is still done manually. Line of scrimmage and offensive team formation recognition are two statistics that must be tagged by American Football coaches when watching and evaluating past play video clips, a process which takes many man hours per week. These two statistics are also the building blocks for more high-level analysis such as play strategy inference and automatic statistic generation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework where given an American football play clip, we automatically identify the video frame in which the offensive team lines in formation (formation frame), the line of scrimmage for that play, and the type of player formation the offensive team takes on. The proposed framework achieves 95% accuracy in detecting the formation frame, 98% accuracy in detecting the line of scrimmage, and up to 67% accuracy in classifying the offensive team's formation. To validate our framework, we compiled a large dataset comprising more than 800 play-clips of standard and high definition resolution from real-world football games. This dataset will be made publicly available for future comparison. © 2013 IEEE.},

This theoretical game is important in understanding why a seemingly selfish strategy does persist and spread throughout a population that is mixing homogeneously at random. For a population with structure determined by social interactions, Prisoner's Dilemma brings to light certain requirements for the altruistic strategy to become established. Monte Carlo simulations of Prisoner's Dilemma are carried out using both simulated social networks and a dataset of a real social network.

abstract={Sign language recognition is a growing research area in the field of computer vision. A challenge within it is to model various signs, varying with time resolution, visual manual appearance, and so on. In this paper, we propose a discriminative exemplar coding (DEC) approach, as well as utilizing Kinect sensor, to model various signs. The proposed DEC method can be summarized as three steps. First, a quantity of class-specific candidate exemplars are learned from sign language videos in each sign category by considering their discrimination. Then, every video of all signs is described as a set of similarities between frames within it and the candidate exemplars. Instead of simply using a heuristic distance measure, the similarities are decided by a set of exemplar-based classifiers through the multiple instance learning, in which a positive (or negative) video is treated as a positive (or negative) bag and those frames similar to the given exemplar in Euclidean space as instances. Finally, we formulate the selection of the most discriminative exemplars into a framework and simultaneously produce a sign video classifier to recognize sign. To evaluate our method, we collect an American sign language dataset, which includes approximately 2000 phrases, while each phrase is captured by Kinect sensor with color, depth, and skeleton information. Experimental results on our dataset demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for sign language recognition. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Accurate estimation of human body orientation can significantly enhance the analysis of human behavior, which is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision. However, existing orientation estimation methods cannot handle the various body poses and appearances. In this paper, we propose an innovative RGB-D-based orientation estimation method to address these challenges. By utilizing the RGB-D information, which can be real time acquired by RGB-D sensors, our method is robust to cluttered environment, illumination change and partial occlusions. Specifically, efficient static and motion cue extraction methods are proposed based on the RGB-D superpixels to reduce the noise of depth data. Since it is hard to discriminate all the 360° orientation using static cues or motion cues independently, we propose to utilize a dynamic Bayesian network system (DBNS) to effectively employ the complementary nature of both static and motion cues. In order to verify our proposed method, we build a RGB-D-based human body orientation dataset that covers a wide diversity of poses and appearances. Our intensive experimental evaluations on this dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={With the rapid development of the RGB-D sensors and the promptly growing population of the low-cost Microsoft Kinect sensor, scene classification, which is a hard, yet important, problem in computer vision, has gained a resurgence of interest recently. That is because the depth of information provided by the Kinect sensor opens an effective and innovative way for scene classification. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for scene classification, which applies locality-constrained linear coding (LLC) to local SIFT features for representing the RGB-D samples and classifies scenes through the cooperation between a new rank preserving sparse learning (RPSL) based dimension reduction and a simple classification method. RPSL considers four aspects: 1) it preserves the rank order information of the within-class samples in a local patch; 2) it maximizes the margin between the between-class samples on the local patch; 3) the L1- norm penalty is introduced to obtain the parsimony property; and 4) it models the classification error minimization by utilizing the least-squares error minimization. Experiments are conducted on the NYU Depth V1 dataset and demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of RPSL for scene classification. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The analysis of game situations in sports games is essential for development of successful game tactics and planning of training. Carling (2008) suggested analyzing action sequences because the study of single actions only gives restricted insight into team's behavior. The aim of the present study is to analyze action sequences in team handball to identify offensive behaviors. For the study 6 games from the EURO-Men-18 in Austria were recorded. Special categories for annotation were defined to assess single actions which then have been merged into action sequences. Shots and up to 5 passes prior the shot were annotated with custom-made software. Out of 3212 actions, each containing information about video time stamp and ground position, the software generated 612 action sequences. To identify different behaviours, similar action sequences were determined using artificial neuronal network software (Perl, 2002). To optimize network performance the dataset was enlarged with noise of 15% to a quantity of 3060 action sequences. Subsequently, the network with a dimension of 400 neurons was trained. Each neuron represents an action sequence pattern. Similar neurons are grouped to clusters representing similar behaviour. The artificial network recognized 32 clusters. Additional, 10 single neurons could not be classified to a cluster. Therefore, 42 different offensive team behaviours were identified whereby 8 clusters represented 49% of the actions sequences. The study revealed the potential to identify playing patterns by analyzing action sequences with artificial neuronal networks. Expert review of the recognized patterns showed a promising accordance with actual playing patterns. Future steps will be the detection of preferred tactics in single teams, the integration of goal success and the identification of successful offensive tactics. © Faculty of Education.

abstract={Cognitive science has long shown interest in expertise, in part because prediction and control of expert development would have immense practical value. Most studies in this area investigate expertise by comparing experts with novices. The reliance on contrastive samples in studies of human expertise only yields deep insight into development where differences are important throughout skill acquisition. This reliance may be pernicious where the predictive importance of variables is not constant across levels of expertise. Before the development of sophisticated machine learning tools for data mining larger samples, and indeed, before such samples were available, it was difficult to test the implicit assumption of static variable importance in expertise development. To investigate if this reliance may have imposed critical restrictions on the understanding of complex skill development, we adopted an alternative method, the online acquisition of telemetry data from a common daily activity for many: video gaming. Using measures of cognitive-motor, attentional, and perceptual processing extracted from game data from 3360 Real-Time Strategy players at 7 different levels of expertise, we identified 12 variables relevant to expertise. We show that the static variable importance assumption is false - the predictive importance of these variables shifted as the levels of expertise increased - and, at least in our dataset, that a contrastive approach would have been misleading. The finding that variable importance is not static across levels of expertise suggests that large, diverse datasets of sustained cognitive-motor performance are crucial for an understanding of expertise in real-world contexts. We also identify plausible cognitive markers of expertise. © 2013 Thompson et al.},

In order to enable the learning of quantitative models directly on data, we developed the Contrails game, an aircraft landing game released to the public on Android phones. Having players perform an abstracted aircraft routing task in the game has allowed us to gather datasets several orders of magnitude larger than typical experiments in the field. Using this data, we have been able to learn a probabilistic model of human control action when presented with an airspace, and to derive quantitative results supporting qualitative observations made in the literature. These results are useful for understanding the simplifications that humans make when presented with complex scenarios involving many moving objects.},

abstract={Inferring the type of activities in neighborhoods of urban centers may be helpful in a number of contexts including urban planning, content delivery and activity recommendations for mobile web users or may even yield to a deeper understanding of the geographical evolution of social life in the city. During the past few years, the analysis of mobile phone usage patterns, or of social media with longitudinal attributes, have aided the automatic characterization of the dynamics of the urban environment. In this work, we combine a dataset sourced from a telecommunication provider in Spain with a database of millions of geo-tagged venues from Foursquare and we formulate the problem of urban activity inference in a supervised learning framework. In particular, we exploit user communication patterns observed at the base station level in order to predict the activity of Foursquare users who checkin-in at nearby venues. First, we mine a set of machine learning features that allow us to encode the input telecommunication signal of a tower. Subsequently, we evaluate a diverse set of supervised learning algorithms using labels extracted from Foursquare place categories and we consider two application scenarios. Initially, we assess how hard it is to predict specific urban activity of an area, showing that Nightlife and Entertainment spots are those easier to infer, whereas College and Shopping areas are those featuring the lowest accuracy rates. Then, considering a candidate set of activity types in a geographic area, we aim to elect the most prominent one. We demonstrate how the difficulty of the problem increases with the number of classes incorporated in the prediction task, yet the classifiers achieve a considerably better performance compared to a random guess even when the set of candidate classes increases. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In a variety of settings ranging from recommendation systems to information filtering, approaches which take into account feedback have been introduced to improve services and user experience. However, as also indicated in the machine learning literature, there exist several settings where the requirements and target concept of a learning system changes over time, which consists a case of "concept drift". In several systems, a sliding window over the training instances has been used to follow drifting concepts. However, no general analytic study has been performed on the relation between the size of the sliding window and the average performance of a learning system, since previous works have focused on instantaneous performance and specific underlying learners and data characteristics. This work proposes an analytic model that describes the effect of memory window size on the prediction performance of a learning system that is based on iterative feedback. The analysis considers target concepts changing over time, either periodically or randomly, using a formulation termed "the problem of the demanding lord". Using a signal-to-noise approach to sketch learning ability of underlying machine learning algorithms, we estimate the average performance of a learning system regardless of its underlying algorithm and, as a corollary, propose a stepping stone toward finding the memory window that maximizes the average performance for a given drift setting and a specific modeling system. We experimentally support the proposed methodology with very promising results on three synthetic and four real datasets, using a variety of learning algorithms including Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor and Decision Trees on classification and regression tasks. The results validate the analysis and indicate very good estimation performance in different settings. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London.},

abstract={How to allocate initial emission permits is vital for the cap-and-trade system in controlling the total emission level and improving the operation efficiency of the trade mechanism. And data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been proved to be more suitable to fairly resolve the problem as a performance-based allocation is involved here. In this paper, we present a novel DEA approach for fair reduction and reallocation of emission permits for areas under administration. The presented DEA models are based on the ideas, where, according to their eco-efficiency and current emission levels, all decision making units (DMUs) compete with each other for the least reduction amount by introducing a bargaining game, on the other hand, the central authority can improve the overall efficiency by reallocating the remaining emission permits. The approach is applied on the dataset of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions from 15 European Union members (EU15). The results of the application show that the reduction and reallocation mechanism is fair, which benefits the countries that work at the optimal scale operation while punishes those that fail to operate on the optimal scale. Furthermore, it is effective in improving the overall efficiency of the system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI), a screening tool used to measure the severity of gambling problems in general population research, was subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and Rasch modelling to (a) confirm the one-factor structure; (b) assess how well the items measure the continuum of problem gambling severity; (c) identify sources of differential item functioning among relevant subpopulations of gamblers. Analyses were conducted on a nationally representative sample of over 25,000 gamblers compiled by merging data from the Canadian Community Health Survey and Canadian Problem Gambling Index (CPGI) integrated datasets. Results provided support for a one-factor model that was invariant across gender, age, income level, and gambler type. Rasch modelling revealed a well-fitting, unidimensional model with no miss-fitting items. The average severity assessed by the PGSI is consistent with moderately severe problem gambling. The PGSI is therefore weak in assessing low to moderate problem severity, a notable limitation of most brief gambling screens. Evidence of clinically significant differential item functioning was found with only one item, borrowing money to gamble, which behaved differently in gamblers who play electronic gaming machines or casino games compared to gamblers who avoid these games. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract={Marketing literature has recently witnessed major debates about the critical drivers of success - namely, the quality versus network effect, in high-tech markets as well as the efficiency of such markets. Extant research suggests that both quality and network effects are significant factors determining market share in these markets, but that quality effect is more important. Based on surveys of several retail managers and a new dataset on the US video game industry from 1995 to 2007, we replicate and extend this research in several directions: (1) we replicate and confirm prior results that both quality and network effects are critical drivers of market share; (2) network and quality effects vary over the product generation life cycle, and hence, quality does not always win; and (3) in the Growth and Maturity phases of the product generation life cycle, network effects can trump quality effects.

abstract={Recent publications in the domains of interactive evolution- ary computation and data visualisation consider an emerg- ing topic coined Evolutionary Visual Exploration (EVE). EVE systems combine visual analytics with stochastic opti- misation to aid the exploration of complex, multidimensional datasets. In this work we present an experimental analysis of the behaviour of an EVE system that is dedicated to the vi- sualisation of multidimensional datasets, which are generally characterised by a large number of possible views or projec- tions. EvoGraphDice is an interactive evolutionary system that progressively evolves a small set of new dimensions, to provide new viewpoints on the dataset, in the form of lin- ear and non-linear combinations of the original dimensions. The criteria for evolving new dimensions are not known a priori and are partially specified by the user via an interac- tive interface: (i) The user selects views with meaningful or interesting visual patterns and provides a satisfaction score. (ii) The system calibrates a fitness function to take into ac- count the user input, and then calculates new views, with the help of an evolutionary engine. In previous work (an ob- servational study), we showed that EvoGraphDice was able to facilitate "exploration" tasks, helping users to discover new interesting views and relationships in their data. Here, we focus on the system's "convergence" behaviour, conduct- ing an experiment with users who have a precise task to perform. The experimental task is set up as a geometrical game, and collected data show that EvoGraphDice is able to "learn" user preferences in a way that helps users fulfill their task (i.e. converge to desired solutions).},

abstract={In recent years, connectivity of systems has meant that online worlds with huge streaming data sets have become common and widely available. From applications such as map rendering and virtual globes to online gaming, users expect online content to be presented in a timely and seamless manner, and expect the volume and variety of offline content to match that which is available online. Generating, retrieving and displaying this content to users presents a number of considerable challenges. This course addresses some real-world solutions to the problems presented in the rendering of massive virtual worlds. Massive worlds present many daunting challenges. In our first talk, we introduce the two most prominent challenges: data management and rendering artifacts. We look at handling massive datasets like real-world terrain with out-of-core rendering, including parallelism, cache hierarchies on the client and in the cloud, and level-of-detail. Then we explore handling jittering artifacts due to performing vertex transform on large world coordinates with 32-bit precision on commodity GPUs, and handling z-fighting artifacts due to lack of depth buffer precision with large near-to-far distances. This serves as an introduction to the following talk, World-Scale Terrain Rendering. Rendering small and medium scale terrain is fairly straightforward these days, but rendering terrain for a detailed world the size of Earth is much more challenging. In our second talk, we discuss the design and implementation of a terrain engine that can render a zoomedout view of the entire globe all the way down to a zoomed-in view where sub-meter details are visible. We discuss processing "off the shelf" terrain data for efficient streaming and rendering, an asynchronous load pipeline for bringing chunks of terrain through a cache hierarchy, efficiently culling chunks of terrain that are below the horizon, driving terrain level-of-detail selection based on an estimate of pixel error, and more. With these techniques, we are able to achieve excellent performance even in the constrained environment of WebGL and JavaScript running inside a web browser. Once we have dealt with the topic of storing and streaming huge amounts of content, we must next contend with production and generation of that content. The next talk will go through the production pipeline at Avalanche Studios and the issues encountered when filling Just Cause 2 with interesting content. It is mix of horror stories, good practices, and lessons learned and applied to titles currently in production. Issues discussed will include the reliability problems for the content tool-chain, the long turn-around times we had, undocumented and poorly understood data dependencies, and all the problems that followed with these. Then we will cover how we have solved these problems for our current content pipeline. We will also talk about our approach to authoring the landscape, vegetation and locations for our large game worlds, and how we maintain productivity without sacrificing variation. Many of the concepts discussed to this point address efficient generation, storage, retrieval and transmission of content. Recent advances in graphics hardware allow GPUs to assist in functions such as streaming texture data, managing sparse data sets and providing reasonable visual results in cases where not all of the data is available to render a scene. In the next talk, we take a deep-dive into AMD's partially resident texture hardware, briefly cover sparse texture extensions for OpenGL and then explore some use cases for the hardware and software features, including some live demos. In our final presentation, we discuss the practical challenges of integrating support for hardware virtual texturing into a real-world game engine, idTech5, which powers RAGE and a number of other titles. We will describe cases where hardware virtual texturing 'just worked', and cases where more effort was required to integrate the technology into an existing engine, whilst maintaining support for software virtual texturing without loss of performance or features. We assume that course participants are familiar with modern graphics rendering techniques, data compression, cache hierarchies and graphics hardware acceleration. We will discuss in some detail virtual memory systems, culling techniques, level-of-detail selection and other related techniques.},

abstract={In machine learning, concept drift can cause the optimal solution to a given problem to change as time passes, leading to less accurate predictions. Concept drift can be sudden, gradual or reoccuring. Understanding the consequences of concept drift is particularly important in human-centric applications where changes in the underlying data and environment are common and unexpected. In order to gain a better understanding of the adverse effects of different types of concept drift on learners, we propose a novel simulation tool that is able to incrementally generate datasets with customisable concept drift by interacting with a human in a game-like setting. We illustrate our approach by generating and analysing concept drift simulations inspired by body-sensor based long-term activity recognition. Our initial results show that current unsupervised adaptation techniques can be caught in cyclic mislabelling and that a hybrid solution that is self-calibrating and semi-supervised is more robust than any of the two taken separately for this example. © 2013 IEEE.},

The preferred model suggests that the probability of a member making a full repayment would be 12 percentage points higher if all the fellow members were to make full repayment compared with a scenario in which none of the other members repay in full.

abstract={Recent initiatives in geosciences education have focused on interactive and inquiry-based learning experiences both inside and outside of the classroom. While the concept is sound, examples and datasets seldom focus on opportunities to which the students can immediately relate. Herein we show how a university tradition has been transformed into an interactive geosciences learning opportunity for the university community. Each year during the third week of November, thousands of university students jump into an artificial pond on campus in support of the annual football rivalry game. An undergraduate student research initiative documenting the water quality of the pond before, during, and after the event clearly documents how humans can affect their environment. Use of the resulting dataset in the classroom for an entry-level geoscience laboratory exercise on water contamination has sparked student interest in the effects of anthropogenic activities on water quality and has mobilized subsequent studies to test additional hypotheses. Changes in students' attitudes on water quality were documented by significant differences in administered pre- and postexercise surveys with five-point Likert-type items, while subsequent interest in the dataset from both the university and the surrounding communities has provided additional audiences for engagement on local water contamination issues. Inclusion of the dataset into laboratory exercises is intended to lead to future research questions and promote independent research initiatives. © 2013 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.},

abstract={Solid understanding of species' range and local population densities is important for successful wildlife management and research. Specific behavioral and ecological characteristics make brown bear Ursus arctos a difficult species to study. We present a map of range and local population densities of brown bears in Slovenia, made with the use of a new approach similar to voting classifications based on a combination of four datasets: Global Positioning System telemetry data, records of bear removals, systematic and opportunistic direct observations and signs of bear presence, and noninvasive genetic samples. Results indicate that the majority of bears in Slovenia live in Dinaric Mountains in the southern part of the country where local bear population densities exceed 40 bears/100 km2. This is one of the highest population densities reported so far for this species worldwide. Population densities decrease towards the north (Alpine region) and are very low along the border with Italy and Austria where almost no females are present. This explains slow past and present expansion of this transboundary bear population into the Alps and should be considered in future bear re-colonization management strategies. Results also showed that data from observations and removals overestimate bear population densities at low values, while mortality and genetic data overestimate population densities in areas with more people. Nevertheless, all data types appeared useful for describing the general bear distribution patterns. Similar approach could be applied to studies of other charismatic or game species, for which several types of data are often available. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Effective acquisition of descriptive semantics for images is still an open issue today. Crowd-based human computation represents a family of approaches able to provide large scale metadata with decent quality. Within this field, games with a purpose (GWAP) have become increasingly important, as they have the potential to motivate contributors to the process through entertainment. However, the existing solutions are weak, when specific metadata are needed. In this work, we present a game with a purpose called PexAce, which utilizes manpower to collect tags characterizing a set of given images. Using novel game mechanics, the game is a single-player, less prone to cold-start problems and suitable for deployment in the domain of personal imagery. As our experiments show, the game delivers tags that characterize images with high precision (using a posteriori expert evaluation and evaluation against the gold standard: the extended Corel 5k dataset). We also employ the game in the domain of personal images, where very specific metadata are needed for their proper organization (person names, places, events) and show, that the game is able to collect even these kinds of metadata. We show that the key to higher quality metadata lies in combining the fun factor of the game with motivation for personal gain. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Microblog users share their life status and opinions via microposts, which usually reflect their interests. Measuring interest similarity between microblog users has thus received increasing attention from both academia and industry. In this paper, we design a novel framework for measuring and visualizing user interest similarity. The framework consists of four components: (1) Interest representation. We extract keywords from microposts to represent user interests. (2) Interest similarity computation. Based on the interest keywords, we design a ranking framework for measuring the interest similarity. (3) Interest similarity visualization. We propose a integrated word cloud scenario to provide a novel visual representation of user interest similarity. (4) Annotation data collection. We design an interactive game for microblog users to collect user annotations, which are used as training dataset for our similarity measuring method. We carry out experiments on Sina Weibo, the largest microblogging service in China, and get encouraging results. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={As social media sites grow in popularity, tagging has naturally emerged as a method of searching, categorizing and filtering online information, especially multimedia content. The unrestricted vocabulary users choose from to annotate content however, has often lead to an explosion of the size of space in which search is performed. This paper is concerned with investigating generative models of social annotations, and testing their efficiency with respect to two information consumption oriented tasks. One task considers recommending new tags (similarly new resources) for new, previously unknown users. We use perplexity as a standard measure for estimating the generalization performance of a probabilistic model. The second task is aimed at recommending new users to connect with. In this task, we examine which users' activity is most discriminative in predicting social ties: annotation (i.e. tags), resource usage (i.e. artists), or collective annotation of resources altogether. For the second task, we propose a framework to integrate the modeling of social annotations with network proximity. The proposed approach consists of two steps: (1) discovering salient topics that characterize users, resources and annotations; and (2) enhancing the recommendation power of such models by incorporating social clues from the immediate neighborhood of users. In particular, we propose four classification schemes for social link recommendation, which we evaluate on a real-world dataset from Last.fm. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over traditional approaches. Copyright 2013 ACM.},

abstract={A majority of the video game literature focuses on the negative effects of violent gaming. In addition, research tends not to analyze in-game practices of varying game genres; instead, researchers treat games as largely uniform interactive media. This study addresses gaming from multiple perspectives, including in-game prosocial actions, learning about civics, and witnessing or practicing antisocial behaviors while gaming. Using the uses and gratifications perspective and social-cognitive theories of gaming as the theoretical backbones, this study analyzed a nationally representative and convenience sample dataset using multiple regression analyses. Several genres revealed positive associations with in-game prosocial actions, learning about civics, and witnessing and/or practicing antisocial behaviors while gaming. Specifically, the role-playing genre was related to prosocial behaviors, learning about civics, and the antisocial behaviors. Similarly, the first-person shooter genre correlated significantly with each of the five dependent variables. Thus, several genres necessitate that gamers behave prosocially, antisocially, and educationally. This lends credence to the argument that games do not simply have negative effects on individuals but can simultaneously have positive effects. These results are discussed in terms of reimagining the social-cognitive theories of gaming, given that the stimulus inherent in each genre is more complicated than traditional games studies assume. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={We describe an ontological model for representation and integration of electroencephalographic (EEG) data and apply it to detect human emotional states. The model (BIO_EMOTION) is an ontology-based context model for emotion recognition and acts as a basis for: (1) the modeling of users' contexts, including user profiles, EEG data, the situation and environment factors, and (2) supporting reasoning on the users' emotional states. Because certain ontological concepts in the EEG domain are ill-defined, we formally represent and store these concepts, their taxonomies and high-level representation (i.e., rules) in the model. To evaluate the effectiveness for inferring emotional states, DEAP dataset is used for model reasoning. Result shows that our model reaches an average recognition ratio of 75.19 % on Valence and 81.74 % on Arousal for eight participants. As mentioned above, the BIO-EMOTION model acts like a bridge between users' emotional states and low-level bio-signal features. It can be integrated in user modeling techniques, and be used to model web users' emotional states in human-centric web aiming to provide active, transparent, safe and reliable services to users. This work aims at, in other words, creating an ontology-based context model for emotion recognition using EEG. Particularly, this model completely implements the loop body of the W2T data cycle once: from low-level EEG feature acquisition to emotion recognition. A long-term goal for the study is to complete this model to implement the whole W2T data cycle. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={This article is based on an investigation of printed South African advertisements in which sexual controversy is deliberately used as a strategy to draw attention. The dataset is a collection of Afrikaans-and English-medium advertisements selected from popular South African magazines published between 2000 and 2010. The purpose of the research is to offer an insight into the nature of controversy as a mechanism in the South African media and to categorise the dataset primarily by means of a pragmatic analysis to identify the implied marketing message. Controversy in the advertisements was associated with themes related to sex, such as nudity, sexism, health and safety issues, and indecent language usage. The research investigated the exploitation of pragmatic instruments, in order to evoke controversy in advertisements, such as the transgression of the conditions governing conversation according to Grice's (1989) Co-operative Principle and the maxims of conversation. A study of controversial advertising may offer a deeper understanding of modern society. As expected, the results indicate that sex still sells and that sexual controversy is by no means fixed or age and culturally bound. Moreover, the character of the advertisements is nowadays very often an intellectual game which requires the target market's cognitive involvement and inter-textual knowledge. © 2013 Copyright University of South Africa Press.},

abstract={Apple iPad is a portable tablet computer that offers users a generic platform for consumer media including games, books, and movies. Though iPad is gaining popularity very quickly, its application in content-based image retrieval and annotation is still in its infancy. This paper aims to develop an interactive system to efficiently retrieve and annotate image objects on iPad, which mainly consists of two components of the front-end GUI (graphical user interface) and the back-end retrieval model. In the first component, an iPad-based GUI is implemented, which can provide users with an efficient way to select query objects and facilitate annotations. In the second component, we propose an object-based image retrieval algorithm that combines a novel feature descriptor based on context-preserving bags-of-words (BoW) and a two-stage re-ranking technique to measure the similarity between the query image and each image in the database. The retrieval results are returned and visualized on the iPad-based GUI, and annotations offered by users can be propagated among them. The communication between the front-end GUI and the back-end module is through the use of wireless networks. Comprehensive experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

The key idea is to use Putinar's Positivstellensatz, a representation result for positive polynomials, to replace each agent's problem by a convex optimization problem. The Nash equilibria are then feasible solutions to a system of polynomial equations and inequalities.

We have performed measurements of network traffic for each of the previously defined action categories for MMORPGs (Trading, Questing, Dungeons, Raiding, Player versus Player Combat, and Uncategorized), as well as measurements of application level player behavior in terms of listed action categories. Based on the obtained datasets we have created network traffic models for each action category and player behavior models with focus on hourly and daily trends. Network traffic models are implemented in Distributed Internet Traffic Generator and verified through comparison with the real traffic. Player behavior models explore number of active players, session duration, as well as lengths and probability of session segments (i.e.; parts of the session consisting of only one category of player actions). We propose an architecture which enables scalable, behavior-driven traffic generation and implement it in a laboratory testbed. In order to achieve scalability of the system, we use Linux Containers as a virtualization technique. The resulting implementation can generate hundreds of MMORPG streams on a single PC. As a case study we used Activision Blizzard's World of Warcraft. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

The network has a dynamic composition in the sense that it has to be trained afresh for determining the loss allocation of every transaction scenario instead of a network which is trained only once for all possible scenarios. The training dataset required is only a few in numbers and is filtered out from a large pool of data. The data pool includes the transactions values and their corresponding allocation of losses computed according to some established allocation method. Performance of the NN following game theoretic and proportional allocation of losses has been reported.

abstract={The evolution of medical imaging technologies and computer graphics is leading to dramatic improvements for medical training, diagnosis and treatment, and patient understanding. This paper discusses how volumetric visualization and 3D scanning can be integrated with cadaveric dissection to deliver benefits in the key areas of clinician-patient communication and medical education. The specific area of medical application is a prevalent musculoskeletal disorder - iliotibial (IT) band syndrome. By combining knowledge from cadaveric dissection and volumetric visualization, a virtual laboratory was created using the Unity 3D game engine, as an interactive education tool for use in various settings. The system is designed to improve the experience of clinicians who had commented that their earlier training would have been enhanced by key features of the system, including accurate three-dimensional models generated from computed tomography, high resolution cryosection images of the Visible Human dataset, and surface anatomy generated from a white light scan of an athlete. The finding from the virtual laboratory concept is that knowledge gained through dissection helps enhance the value of the model by incorporating more detail of the distal attachments of the IT band. Experienced clinicians who regularly treat IT band syndrome were excited by the potential of the model and keen to make suggestions for future enhancement. © 2013 IEEE.},

Participants were 87,735 fifteen-year-old students (49.8% girls) across 15 regions in the PISA 2009 dataset. We divided online reading activities into social entertainment and information-seeking activities and controlled for gender, socioeconomic status, and the availability of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) at home and at school. The indirect effects of knowledge of metacognitive strategies helped to explain why social entertainment and information-seeking activities would predict reading literacy differently. More frequent information-seeking activities predicted better knowledge of metacognitive strategies, which in turn predicted better reading literacy, while more frequent social entertainment activities predicted poorer knowledge of metacognitive strategies, which in turn led to poorer reading literacy. Suggestions were made to guide students in engaging in more online information-seeking reading activities, and incorporate instruction of metacognitive strategies for both online and offline reading, thereby improving students' reading literacy in both printed and digital formats. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Online entertainment communities have exploded in popularity and drawn attention from researchers. However, few studies have investigated what leads people to remain active in such communities at the postadoption stage. We proposed and tested a dual model of entertainment-based and community-based mechanisms to examine the factors that affect individuals' continued participation in online entertainment communities. Survival analysis was employed on a longitudinal dataset of 2,302 users collected over 2 years from an online game community. Our results were highly consistent with the theoretical model. Specifically, under the entertainment-based mechanism, our findings showed that the intensities of initial use and frequent use were positive predictors of players' activity lifespan. Under the community-based mechanism, the results demonstrated that the number of guilds a player was affiliated with and the average number of days of being a guild member positively predict players' lifespan in the game. Overall, our study suggests that the entertainment-based mechanism and community-based mechanism are two key drivers that determinate individuals' continued participation in online entertainment communities. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2013.},

abstract={3D caricatures are important attractive elements of the interface in virtual environment such as online game. However, very limited 3D caricatures exist in the real world. Meanwhile, creating 3D caricatures manually is rather costly, and even professional skills are needed. This paper proposes a novel and effective manifold transfer algorithm to reconstruct 3D caricatures according to their original 2D caricatures. We first manually create a small dataset with only 100 3D caricature models and use them to initialize the whole 3D dataset. After that, manifold transfer algorithm is carried out to refine the dataset. The algorithm comprises of two steps. The first is to perform manifold alignment between 2D and 3D caricatures to get a "standard" manifold map; the second is to reconstruct all the 3D caricatures based on the manifold map. The proposed approach utilizes and transfers knowledge of 2D caricatures to the target 3D caricatures well. Comparative experiments show that the approach reconstructs 3D caricatures more effectively and the results conform more to the styles of the original 2D caricatures than the Principal Components Analysis (PCA) based method. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York & Science Press, China.},

abstract={Visualization of very large digital elevation models plays an important role in many applications ranging from computer games to professional Geographic Information System (GIS). However, the size of terrain datasets is much larger than the capacity of main memory, which brings up serious challenges for the interactive visualization of massive terrain. In this paper, an effective visualization method for large-scale terrain is proposed. In preprecessing stage, the full resolution terrain dataset is divided into several uniform blocks. For each block, a LOD hierarchy, which contains different resolution of elevation data, is constructed based on quadtree-split. In order to save the external memory, a non-redundant storage method is put forward. Different from the traditional pyramid model, we stored only the newly added vertices in each level. The data quantity during real-time rendering decreased effectively due to the sight-line-dependent screen error computation, view frustum culling and detailed culling scheme. To ensure the continuity of navigation, a pre-loading scheme, which based on the view frustum extension, is presented and implemented. Experiments show that compared with traditional methods, our method has reduced the external memory cost by 60% and achieved good visual effect with high rendering speed.},

abstract={Games with a purpose (GWAPs) are increasingly used in audio-visual collections as a mechanism for annotating videos through tagging. This trend is driven by the assumption that user tags will improve video search. In this paper we study whether this is indeed the case. To this end, we create an evaluation dataset that consists of: (i) a set of videos tagged by users via video labelling game, (ii) a set of queries derived from real-life query logs, and (iii) relevance judgements. Besides user tags from the labelling game, we exploit the existing metadata associated with the videos (textual descriptions and curated in-house tags) and closed captions. Our findings show that search based on user tags alone outperforms search based on all other metadata types. Combining user tags with the other types of metadata yields an increase in search performance of 33%. We also find that the search performance of user tags steadily increases as more tags are collected. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={In order to adapt functionality to their individual users, systems need information about these users. The Social Web provides opportunities to gather user data from outside the system itself. Aggregated user data may be useful to address cold-start problems as well as sparse user profiles, but this depends on the nature of individual user profiles distributed on the Social Web. For example, does it make sense to re-use Flickr profiles to recommend bookmarks in Delicious? In this article, we study distributed form-based and tag-based user profiles, based on a large dataset aggregated from the Social Web. We analyze the completeness, consistency and replication of form-based profiles, which users explicitly create by filling out forms at Social Web systems such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. We also investigate tag-based profiles, which result from social tagging activities in systems such as Flickr, Delicious and StumbleUpon: to what extent do tag-based profiles overlap between different systems, what are the benefits of aggregating tag-based profiles. Based on these insights, we developed and evaluated the performance of several cross-system user modeling strategies in the context of recommender systems. The evaluation results show that the proposed methods solve the cold-start problem and improve recommendation quality significantly, even beyond the cold-start. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Information on subcellular localization of proteins plays a vitally important role in molecular cell biology, proteomics and drug discovery. In this field, finding the most suitable representation for protein sample is one of the most crucial procedures. Inspired by the modes of pseudo amino acid composition (PAA), cellular automaton image (CAI) for protein and the chaos game representation (CGR) for DNA sequence, a 20-dimension CGR-walk mode for representation of protein sample is proposed. In the proposed model, the sequence order effect is discussed and manifested with a point of the 20-dimension space. And then, the track of protein sample is projected to all of the twenty amino acids, in another word, a protein sample is expressed by a 20-dimension vector. Followed with the preparation work, the proposed mode is applied into four protein datasets. The comparison results indicate that the present method may at least serve as an alternative to the existing predictors in this field. © 2013 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.},

abstract={Episodic memory modeling enjoys increasing interest in virtual agents, autonomous companions or computer games research communities. To evaluate memory models, it is often necessary to "fill" them with appropriate data - streams of activities corresponding to what would happen to a real human during a particular time period. However, such activity corpora, freely available, are, to our best knowledge, lacking. This paper has two goals. First, it shows two already implemented complementary approaches to generating activity corpora. While the first one uses HTN planning to create a corpus with relatively abstract activities, the second one utilizes a 3D simulation to generate a stream of more fine-grained actions. The key question is evaluation of the resulting corpora in terms of their resemblance to streams of activities of real humans. Thus, the second goal of this paper is to compare the generated corpora to several known datasets of human activity, based on their entropy, compressibility and statistics of transitions between actions. This can be conceived as a first step towards creating general complexity measures of streams of human actions and we see it as the main contribution of this paper. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.},

Our formalism covers notions such as game participation, adversarial relationships, match outcomes, and allows to filter out 'weak' links based on one or more threshold values. Using two novel large-scale OSG datasets, we investigate a range of threshold values and their influence on the resulting OSG graph properties.

abstract={The activity of Social-TV viewers has grown considerably in the last few years - viewers are no longer passive elements. The Web has socially empowered the viewers in many new different ways, for example, viewers can now rate TV programs, comment them, and suggest TV shows to friends through Web sites. Some innovations have been exploring these new activities of viewers but we are still far from realizing the full potential of this new setting. For example, social interactions on the Web, such as comments and ratings in online forums, create valuable feedback about the targeted TV entertainment shows. In this paper, we address this last setting: a media recommendation algorithm that suggests recommendations based on users' ratings and unrated comments. In contrast to similar approaches that are only ratings-based, we propose the inclusion of sentiment knowledge in recommendations. This approach computes new media recommendations by merging media ratings and comments written by users about specific entertainment shows. This contrasts with existing recommendation methods that explore ratings and metadata but do not analyze what users have to say about particular media programs. In this paper, we argue that text comments are excellent indicators of user satisfaction. Sentiment analysis algorithms offer an analysis of the users' preferences in which the comments may not be associated with an explicit rating. Thus, this analysis will also have an impact on the popularity of a given media show. Thus, the recommendation algorithm - based on matrix factorization by Singular Value Decomposition - will consider both explicit ratings and the output of sentiment analysis algorithms to compute new recommendations. The implemented recommendation framework can be integrated on a Web TV system where users can view and comment entertainment media from a video-on-demand service. The recommendation framework was evaluated on two datasets from IMDb with 53,112 reviews (50 % unrated) and Amazon entertainment media with 698,210 reviews (26 % unrated). Recommendation results with ratings and the inferred preferences - based on the sentiment analysis algorithms - exhibited an improvement over the ratings only based recommendations. This result illustrates the potential of sentiment analysis of user comments in recommendation systems. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Experiments using economic games are becoming a major source for the study of human social behavior. These experiments are usually conducted with university students who voluntarily choose to participate. Across the natural and social sciences, there is some concern about how this "particular" subject pool may systematically produce biased results. Focusing on social preferences, this study employs data from a survey-experiment conducted with a representative sample of a city's population (N = 765). We report behavioral data from five experimental decisions in three canonical games: dictator, ultimatum and trust games. The dataset includes students and non-students as well as volunteers and non-volunteers. We separately examine the effects of being a student and being a volunteer on behavior, which allows a ceteris paribus comparison between self-selected students (students*volunteers) and the representative population. Our results suggest that self-selected students are an appropriate subject pool for the study of social behavior.},

abstract={Knowing where sports talent is produced is fundamental to identifying spatial factors in talent production and to assist with talent identification. This research develops spatial analysis methods-the 'Talent Tracker'-to harness geographical information systems and identify regions that are over- and under-producing sports talent. The approach focuses on the professional Australian Football League (AFL), using data sourced from the AFL itself and other sources, to identify differences in regional 'talent yield' based on junior participation. Data from AFL draft records, informants and secondary sources identified the place of junior talent development for the 1290 players who were drafted and played at least one game of senior AFL football in the period 1997-2010. AFL national census data identified junior participation for 94 specified regions for the period 2002-09. AFL talent was assigned to these regions by using ArcGIS procedures, and the datasets synthesised to produce tables and maps of talent yield by participation for each of the 94 AFL regions. The results demonstrate the power of contemporary spatial analysis to open up new research methods for studies into sports talent production and identification. Clear spatial patterns emerge in talent yield at both the national and metropolitan scales. The results provide numerous avenues for further research to explore determining factors for the spatial patterns identified. © 2013 Copyright Geographical Society of New South Wales Inc.},

abstract={The framework of multi-objective clustering can serve as a competent technique in nowadays human issues ranging from decision making process to machine learning and pattern recognition problems. Multi-objective clustering basically aims at placing similar objects into the same groups based on some conflicting objectives, which substantially supports the use of game theory to come to a resolution. Based on these understandings, this paper suggests Enriched Game Theory K-means, called EGTKMeans, as a novel multi-objective clustering technique based on the notion of game theory. EGTKMeans is specially designed to optimize two intrinsically conflicting objectives, named, compaction and equi-partitioning. The key contributions of the proposed approach are three folds. First, it formulates an elegant and novel payoff definition which considers both objectives with equal priority. The presented payoff function incorporates a desirable fairness into the final clustering results. Second, EGTKMeans performs better off by utilizing the advantages of mixed strategies as well as those of pure ones, considering the existence of mixed Nash Equilibrium in every game. The last but not the least is that EGTKMeans approaches the optimal solution in a very promising manner by optimizing both objectives simultaneously. The experimental results suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperforms other rival methods across real world and synthetic data sets with reasonable time complexity. © 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Novel datasets now allow quantification and exploration of multiplex networks. Here we study gender-specific differences of a multiplex network from a complete behavioral dataset of an online-game society of about 300,000 players. On the individual level females perform better economically and are less risk-taking than males. Males reciprocate friendship requests from females faster than vice versa and hesitate to reciprocate hostile actions of females. On the network level females have more communication partners, who are less connected than partners of males. We find a strong homophily effect for females and higher clustering coefficients of females in trade and attack networks. Cooperative links between males are under-represented, reflecting competition for resources among males. These results confirm quantitatively that females and males manage their social networks in substantially different ways.},

abstract={In appearance-based localization and mapping, loop-closure detection is the process used to determinate if the current observation comes from a previously visited location or a new one. As the size of the internal map increases, so does the time required to compare new observations with all stored locations, eventually limiting online processing. This paper presents an online loop-closure detection approach for large-scale and long-term operation. The approach is based on a memory management method, which limits the number of locations used for loop-closure detection so that the computation time remains under real-time constraints. The idea consists of keeping the most recent and frequently observed locations in a working memory (WM) that is used for loop-closure detection, and transferring the others into a long-term memory (LTM). When a match is found between the current location and one stored in WM, associated locations that are stored in LTM can be updated and remembered for additional loop-closure detections. Results demonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using ten standard datasets from other appearance-based loop-closure approaches, one custom dataset using real images taken over a 2-km loop of our university campus, and one custom dataset (7 h) using virtual images from the racing video game 'Need for Speed: Most Wanted.' © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Quantitative study of collective dynamics in online social networks is a new challenge based on the abundance of empirical data. Conclusions, however, may depend on factors such as user's psychology profiles and their reasons to use the online contacts. In this study, we have compiled and analysed two datasets from MySpace. The data contain networked dialogues occurring within a specified time depth, high temporal resolution and texts of messages, in which the emotion valence is assessed by using the SentiStrength classifier. Performing a comprehensive analysis, we obtain three groups of results: dynamic topology of the dialogues-based networks have a characteristic structure with Zipf's distribution of communities, low link reciprocity and disassortative correlations. Overlaps supporting 'weak-ties' hypothesis are found to follow the laws recently conjectured for online games. Long-range temporal correlations and persistent fluctuations occur in the time series of messages carrying positive (negative) emotion; patterns of user communications have dominant positive emotion (attractiveness) and strong impact of circadian cycles and interactivity times longer than 1 day. Taken together, these results give a new insight into the functioning of online social networks and unveil the importance of the amount of information and emotion that is communicated along the social links. All data used in this study are fully anonymized. © 2012 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={A building energy use dataset from over 100 performing arts buildings was created by Julie's Bicycle and Oxford University's Environmental Change Institute. The dataset was used to test the robustness of CIBSE's TM46 entertainment hall benchmark, the closest building type category for performing arts buildings. Based on the analysis it is found that 110 kWh/m2/yr electricity and 140 kWh/m2/yr gas are more robust benchmarks than TM46 180 kWh/m2/yr electricity and 420 kWh/m2/yr gas and that seating capacity is a more useful relative measure than floor area. Therefore, after consultation with CIBSE, Julie's Bicycle and Theatres Trust will adopt the new benchmarks for co-display with Display Energy Certificates and voluntary energy reporting. The energy analysis will be extended to other arts buildings.Practical application: Performing arts venues provide a challenge to the modern professional in the building industry. Running on the tightest budget and rarely employing staff with formal building management training, these buildings face significant technical and financial trials in order to operate in a cost- and carbon-efficient manner. Energy benchmarks can be applied in new and existing buildings, to test designs, motivate owner and occupant action and unlock funds for building energy performance improvement. © 2012 The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers.},

abstract={We identify robust features of trust in social networks; these are features which are discriminating yet uncorrelated and can potentially be used to predict trust formation between agents in other social networks. The features we investigate are based on an agent’s individual properties as well as those based on the agent’s location within the network. In addition, we analyze features which take into account the agent’s participation in other social interactions within the same network. Three datasets were used in our study—Sony Online Entertainment’s EverQuest II game dataset, a large email network with sentiments and the publicly available Epinions dataset. The first dataset captures activities from a complex persistent game environment characterized by several types of in-game social interactions, whereas the second dataset has anonymized information about people’s email and instant messaging communication. We formulate the problem as one of the link predictions, intranetwork and internetwork, in social networks. We first build machine learning models and then perform an ablation study to identify robust features of trust. Results indicate that shared skills and interests between two agents, their level of activity and level of expertise are the top three predictors of trust in a social network. Furthermore, if only network topology information were available, then an agent’s propensity to connect or communicate, the cosine similarity between two agents and shortest distance between them are found to be the top three predictors of trust. In our study, we have identified the generic characteristics of the networks used as well as the features investigated so that they can be used as guidelines for studying the problem of predicting trust formation in other social networks. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

abstract={People are often overwhelmed by the large amount of information provided in museum spaces, which makes it difficult for them to select exhibits of potential interest. As a first step in recommending exhibits where a visitor may wish to spend some time, this article investigates predictive user models for personalised prediction of museum visitors’ viewing times at exhibits. We consider two content-based models and a nearest-neighbour collaborative filter, and develop a collaborative model based on the theory of spatial processes which relies on a notion of distance between exhibits. We discuss models of exhibit distance derived from viewing-time similarity, semantic similarity and walking distance. The results from our evaluation with a real-world dataset of visitor pathways collected at Melbourne Museum (Melbourne, Australia) suggest that utilising walking and semantic distances between exhibits enables more accurate predictions of a visitor’s viewing times of unseen exhibits than using distances derived from observed exhibit viewing times. Our results also show that all models outperform a non-personalised baseline, that content-based viewing time prediction yields better results than nearest-neighbour collaborative prediction, and that our collaborative model based on spatial processes attains the highest predictive accuracy overall. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={This paper describes a series of experiments using the offline trained artificial neural networks (ANN). The ANN acts as an embedded game agent in a shooting game to control the nonplayer character (NPC). The training datasets of ANN are constructed by three different levels of players (expert, medium and beginner players). And then the three different levels training datasets are used to train three different level's ANN, respectively. Meanwhile, the optimal neurons of the hidden layer and the suitable period of training time is obtained by the method of three fold cross validation. In addition, a comparison between ANN and two traditional game AI - finite state machine (FSM) and computer random controlled method, is also implemented in this study. The simulated results show that ANN can get better winning rate than FSM and random method. Meanwhile, ANN obtains a pretty good human-like simulation results. Finally, a fuzzy rules-based approach is utilized to do the dynamic game difficulty adjustment. The experimental results show that the adaptive mechanism developed in this study could dynamic balance the equilibrium of game difficulty. All these, enhance the replayability of the game. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In this chapter, we have presented consideration of sports games as selforganizing systems on the basis of coupled oscillator dynamics. Relative phase was introduced as a metric for investigating the behavioural dynamics of both net games (e.g. tennis and squash) and invasive games different (e.g. basketball and football), with in-phase and anti-phase in some instances representing attractor states for game behaviours at the expense of other possible phase relations. The notion of behavioural perturbations serving to destabilize the system from these phase attractions was introduced and considered important for game description. Moreover, the presence of behavioural perturbations in game sports has been validated from visual inspection although their predicted corresponding associations with relative phase variability await future demonstration for the most part. Beyond considerations of perturbations, relative phase and transitions between phase attractors, artificial neural networks were introduced as a means of identifying game structure from large datasets using football data as example. As with earlier demonstrations using relative phase, various unique phase structures (playing configurations) were identified by the neural networks, together with time-dependent phase changes indicating the underlying game dynamics. In closing, the approaches outlined in this article go some way to describing and explaining the behavioural structure of sports games and their underpinning dynamics. © 2014 Keith Davids, Robert Hristovski, Duarte Araújo, Natàlia Balagué Serre, Chris Button and Pedro Passos.},

abstract={As mobile devices, intelligent displays, and home entertainment systems permeate digital markets, the desire for users to interact through spoken and visual modalities similarly grows. Previous interactive systems limit voice activity detection (VAD) to the acoustic domain alone, but the incorporation of visual features has shown great improvement in performance accuracy. When employing both acoustic and visual (AV) information the central recurring question becomes "how does one efficiently fuse modalities". This work investigates the effects of different features (from multiple modalities), different classifiers, and different fusion techniques for the task of AV-VAD on data with varying acoustic noise. Furthermore we present a novel multitier classifier that combines traditional approaches, feature fusion and decision fusion, with independent modality classifiers and combined intermediary decisions with raw features as inputs to a second stage classifier. Our augmented multi-tier classification system concatenates the output of a set of base classifiers with the original fused features for a final classifier. Experiments over various noise conditions show average relative improvements of 5.0% and 4.1% on the CUAVE [1] dataset and 2.6% and 11.1% on the MOBIO [2] dataset over majority voters and LDA respectively.

abstract={Three dimensional (3D) laser scanning is an important documentation technique for cultural heritage. This technology has been adopted from the engineering and aeronautical industry and is an invaluable tool for the documentation of objects within museum collections (La Pensée, 2008). The datasets created via close range laser scanning are extremely accurate and the created 3D dataset allows for a more detailed analysis in comparison to other documentation technologies such as photography. The dataset can be used for a range of different applications including: documentation; archiving; surface monitoring; replication; gallery interactives; educational sessions; conservation and visualization. However, the novel nature of a 3D dataset is presenting a rather unique challenge with respect to its sharing and dissemination. This is in part due to the need for specialised 3D software and a supported graphics card to display high resolution 3D models. This can be detrimental to one of the main goals of cultural institutions, which is to share knowledge and enable activities such as research, education and entertainment. This has limited the presentation of 3D models of cultural heritage objects to mainly either images or videos. Yet with recent developments in computer graphics, increased internet speed and emerging technologies such as Adobe's Stage 3D (Adobe, 2013) and WebGL (Khronos, 2013), it is now possible to share a dataset directly within a webpage. This allows website visitors to interact with the 3D dataset allowing them to explore every angle of the object, gaining an insight into its shape and nature. This can be very important considering that it is difficult to offer the same level of understanding of the object through the use of traditional mediums such as photographs and videos. Yet this presents a range of problems: this is a very novel experience and very few people have engaged with 3D objects outside of 3D software packages or games. This paper presents results of research that aims to provide a methodology for museums and cultural institutions for prototyping a 3D viewer within a webpage, thereby not only allowing institutions to promote their collections via the internet but also providing a tool for users to engage in a meaningful way with cultural heritage datasets. The design process encompasses evaluation as the central part of the design methodology; focusing on how slight changes to navigation, object engagement and aesthetic appearance can influence the user's experience. The prototype used in this paper, was created using WebGL with the Three. Js (Three. JS, 2013) library and datasets were loaded as the OpenCTM (Geelnard, 2010) file format. The overall design is centred on creating an easy-to-learn interface allowing non-skilled users to interact with the datasets, and also providing tools allowing skilled users to discover more about the cultural heritage object. User testing was carried out, allowing users to interact with 3D datasets within the interactive viewer. The results are analysed and the insights learned are discussed in relation to an interface designed to interact with 3D content. The results will lead to the design of interfaces for interacting with 3D objects, which allow for both skilled and non skilled users to engage with 3D cultural heritage objects in a meaningful way.},

abstract={In this paper, we want to introduce experimental economics to the field of data mining and vice versa. It continues related work on mining deterministic behavior rules of human subjects in data gathered from experiments. Game-theoretic predictions partially fail to work with this data. Equilibria also known as game-theoretic predictions solely succeed with experienced subjects in specific games - conditions, which are rarely given. Contemporary experimental economics offers a number of alternative models apart from game theory. In relevant literature, these models are always biased by philosophical plausibility considerations and are claimed to fit the data. An agnostic data mining approach to the problem is introduced in this paper - the philosophical plausibility considerations follow after the correlations are found. No other biases are regarded apart from determinism. The dataset of the paper ''Social Learning in Networks' by Choi et al 2012 is taken for evaluation. As a result, we come up with new findings. As future work, the design of a new infrastructure is discussed. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In several domains contextual information plays a key role in the recommendation task, since factors such as user location, time of the day, user mood, weather, etc., clearly affect user perception for a particular item. However, traditional recommendation approaches do not take into account contextual information, and this can limit the goodness of the suggestions. In this paper we extend the enhanced Vector Space Model (eVSM) framework in order to model contextual information as well. Specifically, we propose two different context-aware approaches: in the first one we adapt the microprofiling technique, already evaluated in collaborative filtering, to content-based recommendations. Next, we define a contextual modeling technique based on distributional semantics: it builds a context-aware user profile that merges user preferences with a semantic vector space representation of the context itself. In the experimental evaluation we carried out an extensive series of tests in order to determine the best-performing configuration among the proposed ones. We also evaluated Contextual eVSM against a state of the art dataset, and it emerged that our framework overcomes all the baselines in most of the experimental settings. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.},

abstract={Despite the fact that firms spend heavily in marketing their brands across social media platforms, very little is understood about what media content, in a predictive manner, can generate high interaction rates among their prospects and customers. However, such understanding can significantly help brand marketers generate desired engagements with their target audience in marketing campaigns. In this paper, we study the problem of predicting a brand's user interactions on social media using the example of Pinterest, an emerging platform that has provided a large volume of brand as well as user data in the form of images. Specifically, we treat the prediction of a brand's user interactions, captured through "repinnings" on Pinterest, as the retrieval of relevant user-pinned images given a brand image. The prototype system that we build incorporates this basic principle, and is tested on a large-scale Pinterest dataset of more than one million images. We demonstrate that our system achieves significant lifts in recalling ground truth repinners of brand images for a variety of brands across several major industry categories. © Copyright 2013 ACM.},

The purpose of this study is to answer two research questions: is there a difference in emotion induction when users are alone as opposed to when they are with company during watching the movie, and do different personality profiles inuence the emotion induction when users are alone as opposed to when they are with company during watching the movie? We have used the (LDOS-CoMoDa) dataset which contains ratings and associated contextual information for the consumed movies, as well as Big Five personality profiles of the users. The results showed that there is an inuence of social context on emotion induction, and that personality factors have to be taken into consideration since for the different groups of users, based on the personality factors, the emotion induction was inuenced differently.},

As a first study, we take an operations viewpoint of "how well the work is done" and explore multiple quality dimensions of the service supply chain at both international and regional level. In particular, we study the service quality of supplier (ground) services, inflight products, in-flight entertainment systems, and flight attendants' efficiencies. We use a global airlines dataset and quality assessments provided by a renowned quality-audit organization to test our hypotheses. We find that when an airline serves international market segment in addition to its regional operations, the quality of the service supply chain also gets better in the regional market. When managers design and manage service quality expectations in multiple market segments, service quality expectations in higher market segment influences the service quality in lower market segment. © ExcelingTech Pub.

abstract={Context-aware recommender system (CARS) is a highly researched and implemented way of providing a personalized service that helps users to find their desired content. One of the remaining issues is how to decide which contextual information to acquire and how to incorporate it into CARS. While the relevant contextual information will improve the recommendations, the irrelevant contextual information could have a negative impact on the recommendation accuracy. By testing the independence between the contextual variable on the users' ratings for items, we can detect its relevance and impact on the feedback for the item consumed in that specific context. In this article, we propose several new theoretical concepts that should help deciding which information to use, as well as a methodology for detecting which contextual information contributes to explaining the variance in the ratings, based on statistical testing. The experiment was conducted on the real movie dataset that contains 12 different pieces of contextual information. We used two statistical tests with power analysis for the detection, and three contextualized matrix-factorization algorithms with slightly different reasoning for the prediction of ratings. The results showed a significant difference in the prediction of ratings in the context that was detected as relevant by our method, and the one that was detected as irrelevant, pointing to the importance of the power analysis and the benefits of the proposed method in the case of a small dataset. © 2013 The Author.},

Automatic play classification will allow coaches to infer patterns and tendencies of opponents more efficiently, resulting in better strategy planning in a game. We define a football play as a unique combination of player trajectories. We develop a framework that uses player trajectories as inputs to MedLDA, a supervised topic model. The joint maximization of both likelihood and inter-class margins of MedLDA in learning the topics allows us to learn semantically meaningful play type templates, as well as, classify different play types with 70% average accuracy. Furthermore, this method is extended to analyze individual player roles in classifying each play type. We validate our method on a large dataset comprising 271 play clips from real-world football games, which will be made publicly available for future comparisons.},

abstract={Recent research has illustrated privacy breaches that can be effected on an anonymized dataset by an attacker who has access to auxiliary information about the users. Most of these attack strategies rely on the uniqueness of specific aspects of the users' data - e.g., observing a mobile user at just a few points on the time-location space are sufficient to uniquely identify him/her from an anonymized set of users. In this work, we consider de-anonymization attacks on anonymized summary statistics in the form of histograms. Such summary statistics are useful for many applications that do not need knowledge about exact user behavior. We consider an attacker who has access to an anonymized set of histograms of K users' data and an independent set of data belonging to the same users. Modeling the users' data as i.i.d., we study the composite hypothesis testing problem of identifying the correct matching between the anonymized histograms from the first set and the user data from the second. We propose a Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test as a solution to this problem and show that the solution can be identified using a minimum weight matching algorithm on an K × K complete bipartite weighted graph. We show that a variant of this solution is asymptotically optimal as the data lengths are increased.We apply the algorithm on mobility traces of over 1000 users on EPFL campus collected during two weeks and show that up to 70% of the users can be correctly matched. These results show that anonymized summary statistics of mobility traces themselves contain a significant amount of information that can be used to uniquely identify users by an attacker who has access to auxiliary information about the statistics. © 2013 IEEE.},

We collected data in an experiment where users were interacting via speech in a small game, designed as a Wizard-of-Oz experiment, with a computer. Following misunderstandings of one single word of the system, users were instructed to correct this word using prosodic cues only. Hence we obtain a dataset which contains the same word with normal and with high prominence. We extract an extensive range of features from the acoustic and visual channel. Thereby we also introduce fundamental frequency curvature as a measure. The analysis shows that there is a large variation from speaker to speaker in respect to the discrimination accuracy between prominent and non-prominent words as well to which features yield the best results. In particular we show that the visual channel is very informative for many of the speakers and that overall the feature capturing the mouth shape is the best individual feature. Furthermore, we show that a combination of the acoustic and visual features improves the performance for many of the speakers. Copyright © 2013 ISCA.},

abstract={Estimation of discrete games of complete information, which have been applied to a variety of contexts such as market entry, technology adoption and peer effects, is challenging due to the presence of multiple equilibria. In this paper, we take a Bayesian MCMC approach to this problem, specifying a prior over multiple equilibrium selection mechanisms reflecting the analysts uncertainty over them. We develop a sampler, using the reversible jump algorithm to generate draws from the posterior distribution of parameters across these equilibrium selection rules. The algorithm is flexible in that it can be used both in situations where the equilibrium selection rule is identified and when it is not, and accommodates heterogeneity in equilibrium selection. We explore the methodology using both simulated data and two empirical applications, one in the context of joint consumption, using a dataset of casino visit decisions by married couples, and the second in the context of market entry by competing chains in the retail stationery market. We demonstrate the importance of accounting for multiple equilibrium selection rules in these applications and show that taking an empirical approach to the issue, such as the one we have demonstrated, can be useful. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

It tests several hypotheses based on the formal model using a new dataset that contains information about the strength and policy positions of factions inside Italian parties, from 1946 to 2011, measured through quantitative content analysis of motions presented during party congresses. The results show that office, policy and electoral motives influence factions' decisions to break away. Other elements - such as intra-party democracy, the electoral system and party system competitiveness - also affect leaders' attitudes toward compromising and alter the likelihood of a split. © Cambridge University Press 2013.},

abstract={Despite significant progress, tracking is still considered to be a very challenging task. Recently, the increasing popularity of depth sensors has made it possible to obtain reliable depth easily. This may be a game changer for tracking, since depth can be used to prevent model drift and handle occlusion. We also observe that current tracking algorithms are mostly evaluated on a very small number of videos collected and annotated by different groups. The lack of a reasonable size and consistently constructed benchmark has prevented a persuasive comparison among different algorithms. In this paper, we construct a unified benchmark dataset of 100 RGBD videos with high diversity, propose different kinds of RGBD tracking algorithms using 2D or 3D model, and present a quantitative comparison of various algorithms with RGB or RGBD input. We aim to lay the foundation for further research in both RGB and RGBD tracking, and our benchmark is available at http://tracking.cs.princeton.edu. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Researchers have capitalized on microblogging services, such as Twitter, for detecting and monitoring real world events. Existing approaches have based their conclusions on data collected by monitoring a set of pre-defined keywords. In this paper, we show that this manner of data collection risks losing a significant amount of relevant information. We then propose an adaptive crawling model that detects emerging popular hashtags, and monitors them to retrieve greater amounts of highly associated data for events of interest. The proposed model analyzes the traffic patterns of the hashtags collected from the live stream to update subsequent collection queries. To evaluate this adaptive crawling model, we apply it to a dataset collected during the 2012 London Olympic Games. Our analysis shows that adaptive crawling based on the proposed Refined Keyword Adaptation algorithm collects a more comprehensive dataset than pre-defined keyword crawling, while only introducing a minimum amount of noise.

abstract={A new human's operating model using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is proposed to predict man-machine communication. In the proposed method, human's next operation is predicted by the current human operation and the timeline data of the environmental change. The prediction of operation requires two functions: the correctness of predicted change and timing. In conventional study, since the HMM consists of a dataset which data length are not constant, the predicted operation timing is inarticulate even if the estimated change is correct. To solve this problem, we propose to divide the data by a constant length. In this method, the self returning operation change is also modeled and the operation change timing is guaranteed within the divided data length. The data length is defined for the operational characteristic by preliminary check of human operational data. In this paper, the length is set to the frequently-appearing minimum length. By using the data handling and modeling, the operating model can predict precisely the change and the timing. The soccer game is made on PC to evaluate if the proposed method leads to the precise prediction. Finally, we compared the conventional method and the proposed method. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The sustainability trend in the automotive market has been analyzed. A dataset of cars was elicited from select companies that have increased their market share in the United States automotive market over the past decade. In the first part, a linear regression model is developed to evaluate how the market share is influenced by key vehicle characteristics, and in particular, to evaluate the role of sustainability in that analysis. For the second part, game theory has been applied to see how market dynamics change in relation to sustainability moves of two competitors. The third part uses technology forecasting techniques to suggest which technology to invest. The results of the paper show that, in the long term, sustainability will be a significant factor in determining a company’s market share. Investing in manufacturing processes that reduce the cost of battery systems can support the competitiveness of hybrid vehicles but so too can investing in research and development to reduce the energy density gap between gasoline and batteries. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.},

abstract={Diverse online social networks are becoming increasingly interconnected by sharing information. Accordingly, emergent macro-level phenomena have been observed, such as the synchronous spread of information across different types of social media. Attempting to analyze the emergent global behavior is impossible from the examination of a single social platform, and dynamic influences between different social networks are not negligible. Furthermore, the underlying structural property of networks is important, as it drives the diffusion process in a stochastic way. In this paper, we propose a macro-level diffusion model with a probabilistic approach by combining both the heterogeneity and structural connectivity of social networks. As real-world phenomena, we explore instances of news diffusion across different social media platforms from a dataset that contains over 386 million web documents covering a one-month period in early 2011. We find that influence between different media types is varied by the context of information. News media are the most influential in the arts and economy categories, while social networking sites (SNS) and blog media are in the politics and culture categories, respectively. Furthermore, controversial topics, such as political protests and multiculturalism failure, tend to spread concurrently across social media, while entertainment topics, such as film releases and celebrities, are more likely driven by interactions within single social platforms. We expect that the proposed model applies to a wider class of diffusion phenomena in diverse fields and that it provides a way of interpreting the dynamics of diffusion in terms of the strength and directionality of influences among populations. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Background: The Internet's potential impact on suicide is of major public health interest as easy online access to pro-suicide information or specific suicide methods may increase suicide risk among vulnerable Internet users. Little is known, however, about users' actual searching and browsing behaviors of online suicide-related information. Objective: To investigate what webpages people actually clicked on after searching with suicide-related queries on a search engine and to examine what queries people used to get access to pro-suicide websites. Methods: A retrospective observational study was done. We used a web search dataset released by America Online (AOL). The dataset was randomly sampled from all AOL subscribers' web queries between March and May 2006 and generated by 657,000 service subscribers. Results: We found 5526 search queries (0.026%, 5526/21,000,000) that included the keyword 'suicide'. The 5526 search queries included 1586 different search terms and were generated by 1625 unique subscribers (0.25%, 1625/657,000). Of these queries, 61.38% (3392/5526) were followed by users clicking on a search result. Of these 3392 queries, 1344 (39.62%) webpages were clicked on by 930 unique users but only 1314 of those webpages were accessible during the study period. Each clicked-through webpage was classified into 11 categories. The categories of the most visited webpages were: entertainment (30.13%; 396/1314), scientific information (18.31%; 240/1314), and community resources (14.53%; 191/1314). Among the 1314 accessed webpages, we could identify only two pro-suicide websites. We found that the search terms used to access these sites included 'commiting suicide with a gas oven', 'hairless goat', 'pictures of murder by strangulation', and 'photo of a severe burn'. A limitation of our study is that the database may be dated and confined to mainly English webpages. Conclusions: Searching or browsing suicide-related or pro-suicide webpages was uncommon, although a small group of users did access websites that contain detailed suicide method information. © Filippo Castiglione.},

abstract={The past two decades have seen rapid advances in sensors, database technologies, search engines, data mining, machine learning, statistics, distributed computing, visualization, and modeling and simulation. These technologies, which collectively underpin ‘big data’, are allowing organizations to acquire, transmit, store, and analyze all manner of data in greater volume, with greater velocity, and of greater variety. Cisco, the multinational manufacturer of networking equipment, estimates that by 2017 there will be three networked devices for every person on the globe. The ‘instrumenting of society’ that is taking place as these technologies are widely deployed is producing data streams of unprecedented granularity, coverage, and timeliness. The tsunami of data is increasingly impacting the commercial and academic spheres. A decade ago, it was news that Walmart was using predictive analytics to anticipate inventory needs in the face of upcoming severe weather events. Today, retail (inventory management), advertising (online recommendation engines), insurance (improved stratification of risk), finance (investment strategy, fraud detection), real estate, entertainment, and political campaigns routinely acquire, integrate, and analyze large amounts of societal data to improve their performance. Scientific research is also seeing the rise of big data technologies. Large federated databases are now an important asset in physics, astronomy, the earth sciences, and biology. The social sciences are beginning to grapple with the implications of this transformation. The traditional data paradigm of social science relies upon surveys and experiments, both qualitative and quantitative, as well as exploitation of administrative records created for non-research purposes. Well-designed surveys generate representative data from comparatively small samples, and the best administrative datasets provide high-quality data covering a total population of interest. The opportunity now presents to understand how these traditional tools can be complemented by large volumes of ‘organic’ data that are being generated as a natural part of a modern, technologically advanced society. Depending upon how sampling errors, coverage errors, and biases are accounted for, we believe the combination can yield new insights into human behavior and social norms. © Cambridge University Press 2014.},

abstract={Search engines parse diverse, natural language datasets in search of answers to a user query. Not only are they expected to find good answers, they must find them quickly. For public search engines, like Bing and Google, answers that are returned slowly cost more and produce less revenue than answers returned within a second [3]. For private search engines like IBM's Watson [2], slow answers bound the number of queries that can be processed over the lifetime of the hardware. To meet these response time demands, search engines scale out, i.e., they divide datasets across large server clusters and execute user queries in parallel across the cluster. An open research challenge is to reduce the number of scale-out servers needed to ensure fast response times. Recent research reduces scale out by partially executing queries, checking intermediate results, and completing the query as soon as the results exceed a quality threshold [1]. Such partial query execution exploits redundancy within datasets; Often good answers can be found without parsing the entire dataset. IBM's Watson used partial query execution. It buzzed in during Jeopardy games only when intermediate answers exceeded a quality threshold [2]. As another example, Bing used fewer servers by executing queries only until intermediate results reached diminishing returns [1]. Along with measuring the quality of intermediate results, partial query execution requires a mechanism to explore the search dataset iteratively. This poster paper describes a new approach to iteratively explore search datasets. © 2012 Authors.},

abstract={In this era of information explosion, automating the annotation process of digital images is a crucial step towards efficient and effective management of this increasingly high volume of content. However, this still is a highly challenging task for the research community. One of the main bottlenecks is the lack of integrity and diversity of features. We propose to solve this problem by utilizing 43 image features that cover the holistic content of the image from global to subject, background and scene. In our approach, salient regions and the background are separated without prior knowledge. Each of them together with the whole image are treated independently for feature extraction. Extensive experiments were designed to show the efficiency and the effectiveness of our approach. We chose two publicly available datasets manually annotated with diverse nature of images for our experiments, namely, the Corel5K and ESP Game datasets. We confirm the superior performance of our approach over the use of a single whole image using sign test with p-value < 0.05. Furthermore, our combined feature set gives satisfactory performance compared to recently proposed approaches especially in terms of generalization even with just a simple combination. We also obtain a better performance with the same feature set versus the grid-based approach. More importantly, when using our features with the state-of-the-art technique, our results show higher performance in a variety of standard metrics. © 2012 Information Processing Society of Japan.},

abstract={In this paper, we are interested in discovering semantically meaningful communities from a single user's perspective. We define a multi-layer analysis problem to derive a user's activity profile. Such an activity profile would include what activity areas a user is involved with, how important each activity is to the user, and who else is involved with the user on each activity as well as each participant's participation level. We believe a semantically meaningful community (corresponding to an activity area) must also consider the topics of the social messages rather than only the social links. While it is possible to use a hybrid approach based on traditional topic modeling, in this paper we propose a unified user modeling approach based on direct clustering over the social messages taking into considerations of both social connections and topics of social messages. Our clustering algorithm can be performed in a unified way in a unsupervised fashion as well as semi-supervised fashion when the user wants to give our algorithm some seeding inputs on his viewpoints. Moreover, when the new data comes, our algorithm can perform incremental updates on the new data without re-clustering the old data. Our experiments on social media datasets available from both within an enterprise and public social network demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. © 2012 ACM.},

Cross-domain recommenders address the sparsity problem by using Machine Learning (ML) techniques to transfer knowledge from a dense domain into a sparse target domain. In this paper we propose a transfer learning technique that extracts knowledge from multiple domains containing rich data (e.g., movies and music) and generates recommendations for a sparse target domain (e.g., games). Our method learns the relatedness between the different source domains and the target domain, without requiring overlapping users between domains. The model integrates the appropriate amount of knowledge from each domain in order to enrich the target domain data. Experiments with several datasets reveal that, using multiple sources and the relatedness between domains improves accuracy of results. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={The separation of the informative part from an observed dataset is a significant step for dimension reduction and features extraction.

We provide a method to separate the EEG into informative and noised parts, select informative one and rank its dimensions. The proposed approach is based on the theoretical relation between classification accuracy, mutual information and normalized graph cut (NC) value. The presented algorithm requires a priori known class labeled EEG dataset that are utilized for a calibration phase of the brain-computer interface (BCI). Experimental results on datasets from BCI competitions show its applicability for cognitive games. Copyright 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Behavioral data from computer games can be exceptionally high-dimensional, of massive scale and cover a temporal segment reaching years of real-time and a varying population of users. Clustering of user behavior provides a way to discover behavioral patterns that are actionable for game developers. Interpretability and reliability of clustering results is vital, as decisions based on them affect game design and thus ultimately revenue. Here case studies are presented focusing on clustering analysis applied to high-dimensionality player behavior telemetry, covering a combined total of 260,000 characters from two major commercial game titles: the Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game Tera and the multi-player strategy war game Battlefield 2: Bad Company 2. K-means and Simplex Volume Maximization clustering were applied to the two datasets, combined with considerations of the design of the games, resulting in actionable behavioral profiles. Depending on the algorithm different insights into the underlying behavior of the population of the two games are provided. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This work lies in the fusion of experimental economics and data mining. It continues author's previous work on mining behavior rules of human subjects from experimental data, where game-theoretic predictions partially fail to work. Game-theoretic predictions aka equilibria only tend to success with experienced subjects on specific games, what is rarely given. Apart from game theory, contemporary experimental economics offers a number of alternative models. In relevant literature, these models are always biased by psychological and near-psychological theories and are claimed to be proven by the data. This work introduces a data mining approach to the problem without using vast psychological background. Apart from determinism, no other biases are regarded. Two datasets from different human subject experiments are taken for evaluation. The first one is a repeated mixed strategy zero sum game and the second - repeated ultimatum game. As result, the way of mining deterministic regularities in human strategic behavior is described and evaluated. As future work, the design of a new representation formalism is discussed.},

abstract={Online match-based games, such as the online versions of the board game of chess, have already captured a global audience of tens of millions of players. Through a unique combination of characteristics, a relatively short duration - often "coffee-break" minutes instead of hours of continuous gameplay-, weak correlation between matches, and clear emphasis on winning, match-based games may serve a unique segment of the global player population. Although this segment of the gaming population may later become consumers of more sophisticated Massively Multiuser Virtual Environment (MMVE) systems, few previous studies have focused on the characteristics of online match-based games. Complementing them, in this work we collect and analyze information corresponding to 5 online match-based game datasets, totaling over 170 million matches played by a population of 1.3 million unique gamers over 14 years. Our analysis focuses on workload characteristics, win ratio, and player evolution. Studies such as ours may guide the multi-disciplinary field of MMVE design by providing new understanding of player lifetime and behavior. For example, we find a correlation between the interactivity of match-based games and the retention of players over both long and short term, that friendship does not always help to perform better in games, and that in match-based games each player explores tens of different play strategies over time. © 2012 IEEE.},

Via the mutual promotion between the author topics and the author community structure introduced in the ATC model, the robustness of the model towards cases with spare citation information can be enhanced. Variational inference is adopted to estimate the model parameters of ATC. We performed evaluation using both synthetic data as well as a real dataset which contains SIGKDD and SIGMOD papers published in 10 years. By constrasting the performance of ATC with some state-of-the-art methods which model authors' interests and their community structure separately, our experimental results show that 1) the ATC model with the inference of the authors' interests and the community structure integrated can improve the accuracy of author topic modeling and that of author community discovery; and 2) more in-depth analysis of the authors' influence can be readily supported. © Springer-Verlag 2012.},

The ability to reason about the possible a history is critical to the performance of game-playing agents. ISG represents a class of combinatorial search problems which is computationally intensive but challenging to efficiently parallelize. In this paper, we address the parallelization of information set generation in the context of Kriegspiel (partially observable chess). We implement the algorithm on top of a general purpose combinatorial search engine and discuss its performance using datasets from real game instances in addition to benchmarks. Further, we demonstrate the effect of load balancing strategies, problem sizes and computational granularity (grain size parameters) on performance. We achieve speedups of over 500 on 1,024 processors, far exceeding previous scalability results for game tree search applications. © 2012 IEEE.},

We claim that learning, being it supervised or through reinforcement, adapts to skewed data sources. We evaluated our approach on StarCraft: the parameters are learned on a new (freely available) dataset of game states, deterministically re-created from replays, and the whole model is evaluated for prediction in realistic conditions.

Applications like video surveillance, highlight extraction and video summarization require the recognition of the activities occurring in the video. The analysis of human activities in video is an area with increasingly important consequences from security and surveillance to entertainment and personal archiving. We propose an action recognition scheme based on accumulated motion and gradient of motion, in which the former is motion based and the latter is appearance based. Firstly, we define an Accumulated Motion Image (AMI) with which energy histograms are built and normalized for extracting features. Then we compute DFT from the energy histograms so that features like mean and variance are obtained. Secondly, we try finding out gradient direction and magnitude by taking a key frame from the video. Again, we extract mean and variance from histogram giving out few more feature vectors. Finally with all the extracted features, we train the system using Dynamic Time Warping(DTW) to recognize the various actions.Public dataset is used for Evaluation. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={It is often essential for people to consult with others and ask them about their past experience and thoughts when making choices. Exchanging ideas among people has become more meaningful since the extensive growth of information on the World Wide Web (WWW). People have access to tremendous amount of information, but choosing the most relevant information is of high effort. It was when recommender systems came into existence in 1992 in order to assist users in the process of finding the most appropriate information on WWW, and identify sets of items which are likely to be interesting for the users. Recommender systems have used different sources of data in order to identify users' interests. In addition, by growth of social resource sharing like social bookmarking sites, tagging activities can be considered as explicit knowledge for user and item modeling. Existing recommender systems lack use of external source of information for recommending the most appropriate item. They mainly use the information of their own website, while there is valuable information on the web which could improve the performance of the predictions. In this paper, we use Open Directory Project (ODP) data as external knowledge about web pages in addition to tagging activities of users in a social bookmarking site. We have designed a content based recommender system which can recommend the most relevant web pages for each user based on the user's profile and gathered information about web pages from ODP as implicit data. We empirically evaluate effect of ODP data on the predictions using Delicious dataset in order to analyze the performance of the proposed method. The results show that our recommender system outperforms when it uses ODP information as external source of data. © 2012 IEEE.},

In light of this finding, we review the body of research surrounding children's engagement in Screen Time activities and the associated positive and negative effects. Based on existing evidence, we define two categories of Screen Time-Active Screen Time and Passive Screen Time. It is proposed that this distinction provides a more accurate classification of Screen Time and a more informative lens through which to consider the associated benefits and detrimental effects for young children.},

Statistical analysis suggests influence of fingertip size on the results, but no influence of fine motor activity (i.e. playing musical instruments, handicraft, computer games) could be asserted with the given dataset. Results can be used to facilitate task-specific design of sensors and actuators in near-threshold contact situations. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={There are substantial potential benefits to considering predictability when designing defenses against adaptive adversaries, including increasing the ability of defense systems to predict new attacker behavior and reducing the capacity of adversaries to anticipate defensive actions. This paper adopts such a perspective, leveraging the coevolutionary relationship between attackers and defenders to derive methods for predicting and countering attacks and for limiting the extent to which adversaries can learn about defense strategies. The proposed approach combines game theory with machine learning to model adversary adaptation in the learner's feature space, thereby producing classes of predictive and "moving target" defenses which are scientifically- grounded and applicable to problems of real-world scale and complexity. Case studies with large cyber security datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform gold-standard techniques, offering effective and robust defense against evolving adversaries. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a novel physics-based model for analysing team players' positions and movements on a sports playing field. The goal is to detect for each frame the region with the highest population of a given team's players and the region towards which the team is moving as they press for territorial advancement, termed the region of intent. Given the positions of team players from a plan view of the playing field at any given time, we solve a particular Poisson equation to generate a smooth distribution. The proposed distribution provides the likelihood of a point to be occupied by players so that more highly populated regions can be detected by appropriate thresholding. Computing the proposed distribution for each frame provides a sequence of distributions, which we process to detect the region of intent at any time during the game. Our model is evaluated on a field hockey dataset, and results show that the proposed approach can provide effective features that could be used to generate team statistics useful for performance evaluation or broadcasting purposes. © 2012 IEEE.},

In this line, biosignal features based on the theory of orthogonal Krawtchouk and Legendre moments are assessed in the present work over their ability to enhance accuracy in automatic detection of frustration, which is induced through HCI, during video-game playing. Experimental evaluation, conducted over a multi-subject dataset over frustration detection showed that conventional features, typically extracted from Galvanic Skin Response and Electrocardiogram in the past, achieved correct classification rate (CCR) of 83.59%. Fusing these conventional features with moment-based ones extracted from the same modalities resulted to significantly higher accuracy, at the level of 93%. Furthermore, moment-based features lead also to over 10% increase in CCR when the aim was to identify both bored and frustrated cases, within a 3-classs affect detection problem.

abstract={We investigate the problem of influence limitation in the presence of competing campaigns in a social network. Given a negative campaign which starts propagating from a specified source and a positive/counter campaign that is initiated, after a certain time delay, to limit the the influence or spread of misinformation by the negative campaign, we are interested in finding the top k influential nodes at which the positive campaign may be triggered. This problem has numerous applications in situations such as limiting the propagation of rumor, arresting the spread of virus through inoculation, initiating a counter-campaign against malicious propaganda, etc. The influence function for the generic influence limitation problem is non-submodular. Restricted versions of the influence limitation problem, reported in the literature, assume submodularity of the influence function and do not capture the problem in a realistic setting. In this paper, we propose a novel computational approach for the influence limitation problem based on Shapley value, a solution concept in cooperative game theory. Our approach works equally effectively for both submodular and non-submodular influence functions. Experiments on standard real world social network datasets reveal that the proposed approach outperforms existing heuristics in the literature. As a non-trivial extension, we also address the problem of influence limitation in the presence of multiple competing campaigns. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We asked how team dynamics can be captured in relation to function by considering games in the first round of the NBA 2010 play-offs as networks. Defining players as nodes and ball movements as links, we analyzed the network properties of degree centrality, clustering, entropy and flow centrality across teams and positions, to characterize the game from a network perspective and to determine whether we can assess differences in team offensive strategy by their network properties. The compiled network structure across teams reflected a fundamental attribute of basketball strategy. They primarily showed a centralized ball distribution pattern with the point guard in a leadership role. However, individual play-off teams showed variation in their relative involvement of other players/positions in ball distribution, reflected quantitatively by differences in clustering and degree centrality. We also characterized two potential alternate offensive strategies by associated variation in network structure: (1) whether teams consistently moved the ball towards their shooting specialists, measured as "uphill/downhill" flux, and (2) whether they distributed the ball in a way that reduced predictability, measured as team entropy. These network metrics quantified different aspects of team strategy, with no single metric wholly predictive of success. However, in the context of the 2010 play-offs, the values of clustering (connectedness across players) and network entropy (unpredictability of ball movement) had the most consistent association with team advancement. Our analyses demonstrate the utility of network approaches in quantifying team strategy and show that testable hypotheses can be evaluated using this approach. These analyses also highlight the richness of basketball networks as a dataset for exploring the relationships between network structure and dynamics with team organization and effectiveness.},

abstract={Navigation in 3D terrain is considered to be a challenging task and requires virtual camera control skills such as zooming, panning and tilting. Novice users can easily get distracted and disorientated which may result in being lost in space. Solutions for the virtual environment exploration problems are still being researched in order to assist users during their journey inside virtual environments. Among these solutions, assisted camera control techniques require viewpoint computation and path planning. This paper introduces a novel approach to navigate over a 3D terrain using best viewpoints. We exploit the concept of Viewpoint Entropy for best view determination and use Greedy N-Best View Selection for visibility calculations. We integrate road network data to extract regions for detailed visibility analysis in subsections of the terrain. In order to connect the calculated viewpoints, we use an evolutionary programming approach for the Traveling Salesman problem. We present the generated tour using a Google Earth framework. The computed and planned viewpoints in our solution reduce human effort when used as starting points for scene exploration or to generate the representative images of the terrain dataset. The proposed framework can be integrated into 3D game engines or urban visualization systems. This integration gives quickly a glimpse or tour of the environment for novice users without the help of prior planning. Furthermore, terrain visibility used together with road network data and an optimization method for final path construction allows the computed path to be used for large urban area reconnaissance and surveillance tasks with aerial vehicles. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={3D models have become an essential part of many applications ranging from computer games to architectural design, virtual heritage, and visual impact studies. Traditionally, 3D model creation is done using modelling systems such as Maya or Blender. However, these systems have a steep learning curve and require a considerable amount of training to use. Thus, there is a critical need for tools which allow non-expert users to easily and efficiently create complex 3D scenes. To answer to that demand, a number of commercial image-based modelling packages have been introduced recently. Such software offers a very intuitive means to create 3D models from a sequence of images. However, the algorithms employed by these systems are usually kept secret, which makes it difficult to compare them algorithmically and identify common underlying concepts. This paper evaluates the most promising 3D reconstruction software packages with regard to efficiency, accuracy, limitations, constraints and compares them with a system developed by us in order to give an insight into their performance. To achieve that, we first describe our own 3D reconstruction system as a reference in order to make deductions about common concepts and differences. Then, we use a set of benchmark datasets to evaluate all considered systems, and gage their limitations with regard to the number of input images they need and the image resolution. Our evaluation shows that as the number of input images decreases, the geometry of models created using correspondence-based approaches contains more holes. However, the structure and geometry still reflect the original model. In contrast, silhouette-based methods produce coarse and distorted geometry as the number of input images decreases. Models obtained using silhouette-based methods from few input images are often unrecognizable.},

abstract={A fundamental change brought forth by the advent of the mobile internet has been the widespread adoption of mobile phone based applications (apps). Mobile apps are now being used worldwide to perform a variety of tasks - access social networks, read ebooks, play games, listen to music, watch videos and so on. As consumers increasingly use mobile apps, it is important to understand the drivers of demand for these apps. We build a builds a structural model of user demand for mobile apps and jointly estimate it with supply-side equations. We estimate the change in consumer surplus from the usage of mobile apps. We use a panel dataset consisting of apps' sales, prices, and characteristics data from the two leading app stores - Apple App Store and Google Play for 4 months in the South Korean market. Our results show that demand increases with the file size, app age (time since release), app description length, and number of screenshots. In terms of age-restriction, compared to "everyone" (or 4+) apps, "low maturity" (or 9+) and "medium maturity" (or 12+) apps lower demand. Compared to lifestyle apps, gaming apps have a positive impact on app demand while multimedia and education apps have a negative impact on demand. Notably, we find consumer preferences show strong correlation across apps from the same group (i.e., either within free apps or paid apps). We incorporate consumer heterogeneity in the model and find that older and male consumers tend to be less sensitive to the price of apps than younger and female consumers, respectively. In the supply-side we find app file size and app age are major cost component in app development. Also, our findings suggest there exist significant returns to scale in app development. Our counterfactual experiments show price discount strategy results in a greater increase of app demand in Apple App Store compared to Google Play and the effects of price discounts increase non-linearly. Our findings also indicate strong substitution effects between game apps and other apps such as utility and education apps. Using the estimated demand function, we find the top ranked apps in both app stores enhanced consumer surplus by approximately US $158 million over the 4 month period in South Korea.},

abstract={The present study looks at geocaching, a popular location-based mobile game, where the goal is to use a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), usually the Global Positioning System (GPS) to hide and seek containers placed anywhere in the field. People who engage in this activity, the geocachers, constitute a geographically distributed community that makes use of mobile and Web 2.0 technologies to coordinate and document their activities. Consequently, this treasure-hunting game, besides being a ludic activity, associated with a strong social networking element, also promotes new ways of exploring, interacting and communicating experiences and perceptions of the geographical environment where the activity occurs. The majority of existing literature analyzes geocaching from a social point of view, and little reference is made to the geographical context of this activity. The aim of this study is to fill that gap and thus characterize the phenomenon in terms of its temporal and spatial distribution. Observation instruments are proposed based on motorization indexes built from available data attributes. Such attributes reveal behaviors and patterns of geocachers (individuals) and geocaches (objects). The methodology is based on spatial data analysis; this can play an important role in exploring social phenomena that have a strong geographic component. Through the analysis of the freely available dataset that is voluntarily maintained by people engaged in the geocaching activity, a new dimension is explored: the spatial dimension. When, where and why this activity occurs was used as the framework for the analysis in this paper. The final output is an overall picture of the geocaching activity in mainland Portugal in this decade. In a later stage, environmental characteristics are used as possible explanations for observed patterns. It is shown, using spatial model specifications, that a small number of regressors are able to highlight important characteristics in the data. A final discussion underlines the potential of geocaching to encourage social interaction, and promote cultural and natural heritage; in short, it has some paramount attributes of an economically sound and sustainable sector.},

abstract={The Web of Data is an emerging term used to describe a recent trend for publishing and interlinking previously disconnected datasets on the Web in order to make them more valuable and useful as a whole. In the world of gaming, a parallel issue exists in that there are many different types of games, player profiles and web-based discussion systems for gamers that remain disconnected from each other due to a lack of standardised methods for expressing gaming entities and events. In this paper, we describe an approach to link entities in-game and gamer profiles to items on the Web, and vice versa, that exploits Semantic Web technologies. Previous work focused on client-side capturing of gamer information for online profiles, and in the reverse direction, creating game content from open data on the Web. Other work has tackled how community requirements can assist in altering games and providing updated content for gamers. Our work proposes a more generally-applicable solution that would provide for a set of terms commonly found in games to be used on the Web, and to list suitable Web information sources (e.g. Wikia games wikis) that could be used to enhance in-game play. This work will extends previous efforts to create games ontologies, resulting in a more structured RDF games ontology describing game types, features, events and character profiles. We describe how our ontology could be linked to existing Semantic Web vocabularies for describing social data on the Web, including Friend of a Friend (FOAF) and Semantically Interlinked Online Communities (SIOC). © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper illustrates the first part of an ultimately more inclusive understanding of the social relations manifest in the play of Massive, Multiplayer On-Line Games. This initial part is based on the premise that comparative ethnography should be used to frame automated analysis of the electronic traces of player actions. This part involves first examining the spaces that become key elements in the virtual world of playing the game, and then time elements. The interesting ways in which space and time are combined are described next. Such observations demonstrate the feasibility of interpreting actual game play in terms of three factors: What follows from the physics engine chosen to render the games' virtual spaces, what follows from the deliberate play choices of games' designers, what is subconsciously carried over by players from the real world. This is an example of how ethnography can be used to create an analytical framework for focused, even hypothesis-driven analysis of large data sets captured from actual game play - specifically a basis for deciding what needs to be observed out of what can be observed, and what they might mean. Only after such preliminary work does it make sense to automate for statistically valid sampling. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Image segmentation decomposes a given image into segments, i.e. regions containing similar pixels, that aids computer vision applications such as face, medical, and fingerprint recognition as well as scene characterization. Effective segmentation requires domain knowledge or strategies for object designation as no universal segmentation algorithm exists. In this paper, we propose a holistic framework to perform image segmentation in color space. Our approach unifies the linear smoothing filter, a similarity calculation in selected color space, and a clustering game model with various evolution dynamics. In our framework, the problem of image segmentation can be considered as a clustering game. Within this context, the notion of a cluster turns out to be equivalent to a classical equilibrium concept from game theory, as the game equilibrium reflects both the internal and external cluster conditions. Experiments on image segmentation problems show the superiority of the proposed clustering game based image segmentation framework (CGBISF) using both the Berkeley segmentation dataset and infrared images (for which, we need to perform color fusion first) in autonomy, speed, and efficiency. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={To realize the Smart Cities vision, applications can leverage the large availability of open datasets related to urban environments. Those datasets need to be integrated, but it is often hard to automatically achieve a high-quality interlinkage. Human Computation approaches can be employed to solve such a task where machines are ineffective. We argue that in this case not only people's background knowledge is useful to solve the task, but also people's physical presence and direct experience can be successfully exploited. In this paper we present UrbanMatch, a Game with a Purpose for players in mobility aimed at validating links between points of interest and their photos; we discuss the design choices and we show the high throughput and accuracy achieved in the interlinking task. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Microblogging as a new form of communication on Internet, has attracted the attention from researchers recently. Relying the real-time and conversational properties of microblogging, its users update their statuses and share experience within their the social network. Those characteristics also make microblogging an important tool for users to share or discuss real world events such as earth quake or sport game. In this paper, we propose a novel and flexible solution to detect and recognize real-time events from sport games based on analyzing the messages posted on microblogging services. We take Twitter as the experiment platform and collect a large-scale dataset of Twitter messages that are called tweets for 18 prominent sport games covering four types of sports in 2011. We also collect corresponding sport videos for those games. The proposed solution applies moving-threshold burst detection on the volume of tweets to detect highlights in sport games. A tf-idf-based weighting method is applied on the tweets within detected highlights for semantic extraction. According to the experiments we perform on the tweet and video datasets, we find that the proposed methods can achieve competent performance in sport event detection and recognition. Besides, our method can find non pre-defined tidbits that are difficult to detect in previous works. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Robust lip contour detection plays an important role in Facial Expression Recognition (FER). However, the large variations emerged from different speakers, intensity conditions, poor texture of lips, weak contrast between lip and skin, high deformability of lip, beard, moustache, wrinkle, etc. often hamper the lip contour detection accuracy. The novelty of this research effort is that we propose a new lip boundary localization scheme using Game Theory (GT) to elicit lip contour accurately from a facial image. Furthermore, we apply a feature subset selection scheme based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to select the optimal facial features. We have conducted several sets of experiments to evaluate the proposed approach.

A larger data sample allows a more complete description of the Production Possibility Set and, consequently, of the efficient frontier. However, since not all organizations will benefit in the same way, it is convenient to use cooperative game theory in order to share the benefits of the cooperation. The proposed cooperative DEA game is shown to be subadditive and balanced. Models for computing the τ-value of the game and checking its stability, taking into account the exponential number of coalitions that exist when the number of organizations is large, are also presented.

abstract={In this paper we propose a novel, game-theoretic approach for finding multiple instances of an object category as sets of mutually coherent votes in a generalized Hough space. Existing Hough-voting based detection systems have to inherently apply parameter-sensitive non-maxima suppression (NMS) or mode detection techniques for finding object center hypotheses. Moreover, the voting origins contributing to a particular maximum are lost and hence mostly bounding boxes are drawn to indicate the object hypotheses. To overcome these problems, we introduce a two-stage method, applicable on top of any Hough-voting based detection framework. First, we define a Hough environment, where the geometric compatibilities of the voting elements are captured in a pairwise fashion. Then we analyze this environment within a game-theoretic setting, where we model the competition between voting elements as a Darwinian process, driven by their mutual geometric compatibilities. In order to find multiple and possibly overlapping objects, we introduce a new enumeration method inspired by tabu search. As a result, we obtain locations and voting element compositions of each object instance while bypassing the task of NMS. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our method on challenging datasets like the extended TUD pedestrian crossing scene. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All Right Reserved.},

abstract={Background: Pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma are the most common neural crest-derived tumors in adults and children, respectively. We have performed a large-scale in silico analysis of altogether 1784 neuroblastoma and 531 pheochromocytoma samples to establish similarities and differences using analysis of mRNA and microRNA expression, chromosome aberrations and a novel bioinformatics analysis based on cooperative game theory. Methods. Datasets obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus and ArrayExpress have been subjected to a complex bioinformatics analysis using GeneSpring, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and own software. Results: Comparison of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma with other tumors revealed the overexpression of genes involved in development of noradrenergic cells. Among these, the significance of paired-like homeobox 2b in pheochromocytoma has not been reported previously. The analysis of similar expression patterns in neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma revealed the same anti-apoptotic strategies in these tumors. Cancer regulation by stathmin turned out to be the major difference between pheochromocytoma and neuroblastoma. Underexpression of genes involved in neuronal cell-cell interactions was observed in unfavorable neuroblastoma. By the comparison of hypoxia- and Ras-associated pheochromocytoma, we have found that enhanced insulin like growth factor 1 signaling may be responsible for the activation of Src homology 2 domain containing transforming protein 1, the main co-factor of RET. Hypoxia induced factor 1α and vascular endothelial growth factor signaling included the most prominent gene expression changes between von Hippel-Lindau- and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A-associated pheochromocytoma. Conclusions: These pathways include previously undescribed pathomechanisms of neuroblastoma and pheochromocytoma and associated gene products may serve as diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets. © 2012 Szabo et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We focused on four emotions that are often observed when people are playing video games: triumph, frustration, defeat, and concentration. The dataset consists of recordings of the rotation angles of the player's joints while playing Wii sports games. We applied various machine learning techniques and bagged them for prediction. When body pose and movement features are used we can reach an overall accuracy of 66.5% for differentiating between these four emotions. In contrast, when using the raw joint rotations, limb rotation movement, or posture features alone, we were only able to achieve accuracy rates of 59%, 61%, and 62% respectively. Our results suggest that features representing changes in body posture can yield improved classification rates over using static postures or joint information alone. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Adaptive adversaries are a primary concern in several domains, including cyber defense, border security, counterterrorism, and fraud prevention, and consequently there is great interest in developing defenses that maintain their effectiveness in the presence of evolving adversary strategies and tactics. This paper leverages the coevolutionary relationship between attackers and defenders to derive two new approaches to predictive defense, in which future attack techniques are anticipated and these insights are incorporated into defense designs. The first method combines game theory with machine learning to model and predict future adversary actions in the learner's "feature space"; these predictions form the basis for synthesizing robust defenses. The second approach to predictive defense involves extrapolating the evolution of defense configurations forward in time, in the space of defense parameterizations, as a way of generating defenses which work well against evolving threats. Case studies with a large cyber security dataset assembled for this investigation demonstrate that each method provides effective, scalable defense against current and future attacks, outperforming gold-standard techniques. Additionally, preliminary tests indicate that a simple variant of the proposed design methodology yields defenses which are difficult for adversaries to reverse-engineer. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The wisdom of crowds has been recognized as an effective decision making mechanism by aggregating information from different individuals to derive an overall decision. However, in this information aggregation process, individuals may be influenced by various factors and provide biased claims (or individual level decisions), especially when such claims are related to their economic benefits. In this research, we investigate crowd's claims in binary decisions under explicit constant influence and aim to understand their real but hidden belief (distribution) on the decision. Particularly, we take fixed odds betting on binary events as a representative scenario in this study. We model the relationship between event probability and crowds' belief distribution as a linear combination of Beta distributions. Taking a Maximization Likelihood Estimation (MLE) paradigm, we estimate the parameters of this distribution based on observed crowds' bets. In this process, we model individual betting decisions under the influence of odds using prospect theory. We apply the framework on a real world dataset of Olympic Games outcome betting. After identifying betting participants' hidden belief distribution, we also found that crowds' belief tend to tilt to the high probability side of the event (if there is no outside influence), which partially explains why the wisdom of crowds can make decision marking easier. We believe this paper contributes to the literature of crowd intelligence and can help generating more accurate digestions of the wisdom of crowds. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper discusses the influence that decisions about data cleaning and violations of statistical assumptions can have on drawing valid conclusions to research studies. The datasets provided in this paper were collected as part of a National Science Foundation grant to design online games and associated labs for use in undergraduate and graduate statistics courses that can effectively illustrate issues not always addressed in traditional instruction. Students play the role of a researcher by selecting from a wide variety of independent variables to explain why some students complete games faster than others.Typical project data sets are "messy," with many outliers (usually from some students taking much longer than others) and distributions that do not appear normal. Classroom testing of the games over several semesters has produced evidence of their efficacy in statistics education. The projects tend to be engaging for students and they make the impact of data cleaning and violations of model assumptions more relevant. We discuss the use of one of the games and associated guided lab in introducing students to issues prevalent in real data and the challenges involved in data cleaning and dangers when model assumptions are violated. © 2012 Cummiskey, Kuiper and Sturdivant.},

abstract={Mapping savanna tree species is of broad interest for savanna ecology and rural resource inventory. We investigated the utility of (i) the Carnegie Airborne Observatory (CAO) hyperspectral data, and WorldView-2 and Quickbird multispectral spectral data and (ii) a combined spectral. +. tree height dataset (derived from the CAO LiDAR system) for mapping seven common savanna tree species or genera in the Sabi Sands Reserve and communal lands adjacent to Kruger National Park, South Africa. We convolved the 72 spectral bands of the CAO imagery to eight and four multispectral channels available in the WorldView-2 and Quickbird satellite sensors, respectively. A combination of the simulated WorldView-2 data and LiDAR tree height imagery was also assessed for species classification. First, the simulated WorldView-2 imagery provided a higher classification accuracy (77% ± 3.1 (mean ± standard deviation)) when compared to the simulated Quickbird (65% ± 1.9) and CAO (65% ± 1.2) data. Secondly, the combined spectral. +. height dataset provided a slightly higher overall classification accuracy (79% ± 1.8) when compared to the WorldView-2 spectral only dataset. The difference was however, statistically significant (p<0.001; one-way analysis of variance for 30 bootstrapped replicates (n=100) of the independent validation dataset). Higher classification accuracies were observed for trees with large crowns such as S. birrea, S. africana and A. nigrescens as compared to trees with small crowns. Species composition and diversity maps of trees with large crowns were consistent with established knowledge in the area. For example, the results showed higher tree diversity (number of different species per ha) in the Sabi Sands game reserve than in the communal areas. This study highlights the feasibility of remote sensing of tree species at the landscape scale in African savannas and the potential applicability of WorldView-2 sensor in mapping savanna tree species with a large crown. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={User votes are important signals in community question-answering (CQA) systems. Many features of typical CQA systems, e.g. the best answer to a question, status of a user, are dependent on ratings or votes cast by the community. In a popular CQA site, Yahoo! Answers, users vote for the best answers to their questions and can also thumb up or down each individual answer. Prior work has shown that these votes provide useful predictors for content quality and user expertise, where each vote is usually assumed to carry the same weight as others. In this paper, we analyze a set of possible factors that indicate bias in user voting behavior - these factors encompass different gaming behavior, as well as other eccentricities, e.g., votes to show appreciation of answerers. These observations suggest that votes need to be calibrated before being used to identify good answers or experts. To address this problem, we propose a general machine learning framework to calibrate such votes. Through extensive experiments based on an editorially judged CQA dataset, we show that our supervised learning method of content-agnostic vote calibration can significantly improve the performance of answer ranking and expert ranking. © 2012 ACM.},

Relatively few studies have systematically analyzed the motivation to create and share content, especially from the perspective of a common user. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of user posting behavior on a popular social media website, Twitter. Specifically, we assume that user behavior is mainly influenced by three factors: breaking news, posts from social friends and user's intrinsic interest, and propose a mixture latent topic model to combine all these factors. We evaluated our model on a large-scale Twitter dataset from three different perspectives: the perplexity of held-out content, the performance of predicting retweets and the quality of generated latent topics. The results were encouraging, our model clearly outperformed its competitors. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Ranking of images is difficult because many factors determine their importance (e.g., popularity, quality, entertainment value, context, etc.). In social media platforms, ranking also depends on social interactions and on the visibility of the images both inside and outside those platforms. In this context, the application of standard ranking methods is not clearly understood, and neither are the subtleties associated with taking into account social interaction, internal, and external factors. In this paper, we use a large Flickr dataset and investigate these factors by performing an in-depth analysis of several ranking algorithms using both internal (i.e., within Flickr) and external (i.e., links from outside of Flickr) factors. We analyze rankings given by common metrics used in image retrieval (e.g., number of favorites), and compare them with metrics based on page views (e.g., time spent, number of views). In addition, we represent users' navigation by a graph and combine session models with some of these metrics, comparing with PageRank and BrowseRank. Our experiments show significant differences between the rankings, providing insights on the impact of social interactions, internal, and external factors in image ranking. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Having sufficient training images with fully annotated object locations is undoubtedly critical for modern learning-based image annotation, retrieval, and object detection methods. Typically, collecting such annotations for large-scale datasets is notoriously tedious because the process involves amount of manual cropping and hand labeling operations. In this work, following the principle of games with a purpose (GWAP), we design a so-called purposive hidden-object-game (P-HOG), which imperceptibly embeds localizing objects into enjoyable playing game process and thus attracts many people to make voluntary contribution to annotating images. In particular, besides preserving the interestingness as popular HOG games, P-HOG is able to automatically generate satisfactory game images (i.e., hide certain items into target images) by integrating several semantic and visual processing techniques. P-HOG is also built in an effective mechanism to prevent the players from cheating. The mechanism inherits the merit of Recaptcha and identifies potential cheating behavior based on the annotation accuracy of some known items. Moreover, P-HOG will filter noisy annotations effectively based on a weighted majority method and improve the accuracy of the raw annotations from the players. Most importantly, players only play P-HOG for entertainment purpose and they are unaware of the background data collection procedure. The collected data are used towards constructing a large database, which may benefit general learning-based algorithms for multimedia tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work dedicated to such a specific and important task under the GWAP framework. We conduct a pilot study of the game prototype and the comprehensive experiments show that the P-HOG appeals to general players, and is effective for collecting massive object locations with satisfactory accuracy, which further boosts the algorithmic performances for both tag refinement and image annotation tasks. © 1999-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Accurate prediction of user behaviors is important for many social media applications, including social marketing, personalization and recommendation, etc. A major challenge lies in that, the available behavior data or interactions between users and items in a given social network are usually very limited and sparse (e.g., >= 99.9% empty). Many previous works model user behavior from only historical user logs. We observe that many people are members of several social networks in the same time, such as Facebook, Twitter and Tencent's QQ. Importantly, their behaviors and interests in different networks influence one another. This gives us an opportunity to leverage the knowledge of user behaviors in different networks, in order to alleviate the data sparsity problem, and enhance the predictive performance of user modeling. Combining different networks "simply and naively" does not work well. Instead, we formulate the problem to model multiple networks as "composite network knowledge transfer". We first select the most suitable networks inside a composite social network via a hierarchical Bayesian model, parameterized for individual users, and then build topic models for user behavior prediction using both the relationships in the selected networks and related behavior data. To handle big data, we have implemented the algorithm using Map/Reduce. We demonstrate that the proposed composite network-based user behavior model significantly improve the predictive accuracy over a number of existing approaches on several real world applications, such as a very large social-networking dataset from Tencent Inc. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Text mining has been very successful in extracting huge amounts of commonsense knowledge from data, but the extracted knowledge tends to be extremely noisy. Manual construction of knowledge repositories, on the other hand, tends to produce high-quality data in very small amounts. We propose an architecture to combine the best of both worlds: A game with a purpose that induces humans to clean up data automatically extracted by text mining. First, a text miner trained on a set of known commonsense facts harvests many more candidate facts from corpora. Then, a simple slot-machine-with-a-purpose game presents these candidate facts to the players for verification by playing. As a result, a new dataset of high precision commonsense knowledge is created. This combined architecture is able to produce significantly better commonsense facts than the state-of-the-art text miner alone. Furthermore, we report that bootstrapping (i.e., training the text miner on the output of the game) improves the subsequent performance of the text miner. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Background and aims: Though women make up roughly one third of all problem gamblers, research has typically focused on male problem gamblers. Recent research has started to shift its attention toward the importance of gender. However, studies rarely attempt to understand gender differences in problem gambling or subject these differences to thorough multivariate analyses. To address some of the gaps in our knowledge of gender differences, we examine whether patterns of gambling behavior and psychological factors mediate the relationship between gender and problem gambling. Methods: We use logistic multiple regression to analyze two large Canadian datasets - the 2005 Ontario Prevalence Survey and the 2007 Canadian Community Health Survey. Results: Variables found to mediate the relationship between gender and problem gambling are the type(s) of game(s) played (in the 2005 Ontario Prevalence Survey) and the number of games played (in the 2007 Canadian Community Health Survey). Conclusions: Men are more likely to be problem gamblers than women, and this gender difference is understandable in terms of differences in patterns of gambling behavior. We conclude that men experience problems because they play riskier games and women experience problems because they prefer chance-based games, which are associated with significantly higher odds of problem gambling. We specify the three main ways that women's reasons for gambling - to escape or for empowerment - translate into chance-based games. © 2012 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.},

We discuss the application domain of human pose estimation and activity recognition and the associated requirements, covering: advanced human-computer interaction (HCI), assisted living, gesture-based interactive games, intelligent driver assistance systems, movies, 3D TV and animation, physical therapy, autonomous mental development, smart environments, sport motion analysis, video surveillance, and video annotation. Next, we review and categorize recent approaches which have been proposed to comply with these requirements. We report a comparison of the most promising methods for multi-view human action recognition using two publicly available datasets: the INRIA Xmas Motion Acquisition Sequences (IXMAS) Multi-View Human Action Dataset, and the i3DPost Multi-View Human Action and Interaction Dataset. To compare the proposed methods, we give a qualitative assessment of methods which cannot be compared quantitatively, and analyze some prominent 3D pose estimation techniques for application, where not only the performed action needs to be identified but a more detailed description of the body pose and joint configuration. Finally, we discuss some of the shortcomings of multi-view camera setups and outline our thoughts on future directions of 3D body pose estimation and human action recognition. © 2012 IEEE.},

The evaluation framework will extend the time-based event detection metric to model multiple distinct action classes.

Furthermore, a new dataset, G3D for real-time action recognition in gaming containing synchronised video, depth and skeleton data is provided.

By using a low-cost RGBD sensor, we capture synchronized, registered images, depth maps, and skeletons of users playing a movement-based game and automatically filter the data to keep a subset of unique poses.

abstract={One of the challenges which need to be faced in the field of the information processing is the need to cope with huge amounts of data. There exist many different environments in which large quantities of information are produced. For example, in a command-line interface, a computer user types thousand of commands which can hide information about the behavior of her/his. However, processing this kind of streaming data on-line is a hard problem. This paper address the use of a dimensionality reduction perspective to classify streaming data and present a preliminary work for its adaptation to new data in changeable environments. This new extended proposal allows from a computational point of view the treatment of the new data without any penalty and evolving the previously analyzed data. Some results of the general technique are presented jointly with a comparison between the dimensionality reduction approach and using the full dataset. The results obtained show some of the advantages of using dimensionality reduction in streaming data and gives a new perspective to use it in changeable environments. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={We conduct comprehensive measurements on the current practice of content bundling to understand the structural patterns of torrents and the participant behaviors of swarms on one of the largest BitTorrent portals: The Pirate Bay. From the datasets of the 120K torrents and 14.8M peers, we investigate what constitutes torrents and how users participate in swarms from the perspective of bundling, across different content categories: Movie, TV, Porn, Music, Application, Game and E-book. In particular, we focus on: (1) how prevalent content bundling is, (2) how and what files are bundled into torrents, (3) what motivates publishers to bundle files, and (4) how peers access the bundled files. We find that over 72% of BitTorrent torrents contain multiple files, which indicates that bundling is widely used for file sharing. We reveal that profit-driven BitTorrent publishers who promote their own web sites for financial gains like advertising tend to prefer to use the bundling. We also observe that most files (94%) in a bundle torrent are selected by users and the bundle torrents are more popular than the single (or non-bundle) ones on average. Overall, there are notable differences in the structural patterns of torrents and swarm characteristics (i) across different content categories and (ii) between single and bundle torrents. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={Privacy protection appears as a fundamental concern when personal data is collected, stored, and published. Several anonymization methods have been proposed to address privacy issues in private datasets. Every anonymization method has at least one parameter to adjust the level of privacy protection considering some utility for the collected data. Choosing a desirable level of privacy protection is a crucial decision and so far no systematic mechanism exists to provide directions on how to set the privacy parameter. In this paper, we model this challenge in a game theoretic framework to find consensual privacy protection levels and recognize the characteristics of each anonymization method. Our model can potentially be used to compare different anonymization methods and distinguish the settings that make one anonymization method more appealing than the others. We describe the general approach to solve such games and elaborate the procedure using k-anonymity as a sample anonymization method. Our simulations of the game results in the case of k-anonymity reveals how the equilibrium values of k depend on the number of quasi-identifiers, maximum number of repetitive records, anonymization cost, and public's privacy behaviour. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract={Regulators attempt to understand financial markets and their risks in terms of categories of knowledge and datasets that are defined and produced by the markets. However, regulators cannot adequately interpret or utilize such knowledge, for reasons including their social distance from the sites of knowledge production, the diversity of financial firms' proprietary risk models, firms' abilities to game the rules thus rendering the 'metrics' meaningless and several backfiring aspects of global regulatory networking and reform. Calls for yet more information about trading, posed in terms of the merits of transparency, result in information swamping of regulators. Meanwhile, while policy-makers tinker with regulatory structures ('architecture'), political reaction to the crisis de-legitimizes public regulation as a project. Yet there is one positive aspect of the reforms - enhancing powers for 'resolution' of financial firms in ways that impact upon investors while minimizing wider destabilization - upon which the regulatory information requirement can and should be refocused. To protect the public interest, legal transparency is required, trading transparency is not. This paper introduces these issues by drawing on critical work on transparency and markets. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Sina microblog is an increasingly popular social network service in China. According to previous researches, microblog is considered to possess some characters of news media. However, except for the studies focusing on detecting real-time event spread around the globe, little work has been done to excavate news in daily life. In this paper, we conducted a study of filtering news in Sina microblog. We first generalized the definition of news by user surveys and quantitative analysis. Then we built a news recommendation system by modeling the users and applying several certified heuristic rules. Finally we evaluated the system and found out its satisfying performance in different datasets. By applying our news recommendation system, people can get news-worthy information for themselves while the entertaining tweets, which are omnipresent in microblog, are put in the last of the news list. Therefore we can achieve a much better understanding of heuristic rules about news by this work, which is helpful to certain official organizations as they need to detect and supervise the popular news among the public. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper describes a methodology for detecting anomalies from sequentially observed and potentially noisy data. The proposed approach consists of two main elements: 1) filtering, or assigning a belief or likelihood to each successive measurement based upon our ability to predict it from previous noisy observations and 2) hedging, or flagging potential anomalies by comparing the current belief against a time-varying and data-adaptive threshold. The threshold is adjusted based on the available feedback from an end user. Our algorithms, which combine universal prediction with recent work on online convex programming, do not require computing posterior distributions given all current observations and involve simple primal-dual parameter updates. At the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and which yield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both static and slowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn from the same exponential family. Moreover, the regret against static distributions coincides with the minimax value of the corresponding online strongly convex game. We also prove bounds on the number of mistakes made during the hedging step relative to the best offline choice of the threshold with access to all estimated beliefs and feedback signals. We validate the theory on synthetic data drawn from a time-varying distribution over binary vectors of high dimensionality, as well as on the Enron email dataset. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

Based on studying the most popular game "Buying-a-house," we investigate user behaviors. First, we made a model for "Buying-a-house, " then using the dataset that we crawled and traced (we crawled about one hundred and fifty user's profiles and traced forty users for about twenty days), we draw the following findings: (1) People who just join the game have much interest in this OSN, actively interact with his friends. (2) The interest goes down according to the time lapse for most of users, but there are also a few players whose interests never go down and enjoy this game very much. These can be interpreted as the population of kaixin-net is growing at the beginning state, but it will decline after the peak comes. So the organizers should think about how to slow down the peak's coming.},

The opportunities offered by the Web of Data and Semantic Web technologies introduce new interesting challenges. In particular, the main benefits for user profiling techniques are given by the extensive amount of already available and structured information and the solution to the "cold start" problem. On the other hand it is difficult to manage a massive "open corpus" such as the Web of Data and select only the relevant features and sources from an heterogeneous collection of datasets. Hence we propose semantic technologies for interlinking social websites and provenance management on the Web of Data to retrieve accurate information about data producers. The goal is to build comprehensive user profiles based on qualitative and quantitative measures about user activities across social sites. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Collaborative filtering recommender systems provide their users with relevant items based on information from other similar users. Popular collaborative filtering approaches such as Pearson correlation coefficient and cosine similarity, compute the similarity between users based on the set of their co-rated items. However, similarities are commonly computed without taking the popularity of the set of two users' co-rated items into consideration, e.g. an item rated by very many users should have less impact on the similarity measure, and analogously an item rated by few should have a larger impact on the similarity score of two users. In this paper, we investigate the effects of common weighting schemes on different types of users, i.e. new users with few ratings (so-called cold start users), post cold start users, and power users. Empirical studies over two datasets have shown in which of these cases weighting schemes are beneficial in terms of recommendation quality. © 2012 ACM.},

There are many different rendering and visualization algorithms and interactive techniques that enhance perception of volume data and these techniques' effectiveness have been evaluated. However, the effect of VR displays on perception of volume data is less well studied. Therefore, we conduct two experiments on how various display conditions affect a participant's depth perception accuracy of a volumetric dataset. A demographic pre-questionnaire also allows us to separate the accuracy differences between participants with more and less experience with 3D games and VR. Our results show an overall benefit for stereo with head-tracking for enhancing perception of depth in volumetric data. Our study also suggests that familiarity with 3D games and VR type technology affects the users'ability to perceive such data and affects the accuracy boost due to VR displays. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={There has been significant recent interest in studying consumer behavior in sponsored search advertising (SSA). Researchers have typically used daily data from search engines containing measures such as average bid, average ad position, total impressions, clicks and cost for each keyword in the advertiser's campaign. A variety of random utility models have been estimated using such data and the results have helped researchers explore the factors that drive consumer click and conversion propensities. However, virtually every analysis of this kind has ignored the intra-day variation in ad position. We show that estimating random utility models on aggregated (daily) data without accounting for this variation will lead to systematically biased estimates - specifically, the impact of ad position on click-through rate (CTR) is attenuated and the predicted CTR is higher than the actual CTR. First, we prove that the average daily position of an ad is less in convex order than the actual position of the ad for an impression. Using this result, we analytically demonstrate the existence of the aggregation bias. Second, using a large disaggregate dataset from a major search engine containing 8 million impressions, we empirically validate our findings for both the traditional logit model and the Hierarchical Bayesian models that are commonly used in the SSA literature. Third, we build a game-theoretic model to analyze the effect of the bias on the equilibrium of the SSA auction.We find that advertisers bid lower in SSA auctions as a result of the bias, which always leads to lower search-engine revenue. We also find that an advertiser can always increase his payoff when he unilaterally switches to complete data from aggregate data. Finally, we empirically quantify the losses experienced by the search engine and the advertisers and find that the search engine loses over 17% of its revenue on average. We also observe that an advertiser loses around 6% of his payoffs due to data aggregation. Our findings raise serious concerns for SSA practitioners and also question the adequacy of the data standards that have become common in SSA. Finally, we provide recommendations for aggregate datasets that do not suffer from the bias. © 2012 Authors.},

It combines the advantages of columnar data layout with other known techniques (such as using composite range partitions) and extensive algorithmic engineering on key data structures. The main goal of the latter being to reduce the main memory footprint and to increase the efficiency in processing typical user queries. In this combination we achieve large speed-ups.

abstract={Wireless sensor networks are evolving from single-application platforms towards an integrated infrastructure shared by multiple applications. Given the resource constraints of sensor nodes, it is important to optimize the allocation of applications to maximize the overall Quality of Monitoring (QoM). Recent solutions to this challenging application allocation problem are centralized in nature, limiting their scalability and robustness against network failures and dynamics. This paper presents a distributed game-theoretic approach to application allocation in shared sensor networks. We first transform the optimal application allocation problem to a submodular game and then develop a decentralized algorithm that only employs localized interactions among neighboring nodes. We prove that the network can converge to a pure strategy Nash equilibrium with an approximation bound of 1=2. Simulations based on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our algorithm is competitive against a state-of-the-art centralized algorithm in terms of QoM. © 2012 IEEE.},

Malls are trying various ways to attract consumers and they spend a lot of money for this purpose. Therefore, there is a growing need for information relating to consumers perceptions, their shopping values and the various mall attributes that traders and shops look for. This research paper presents a cross sectional study on the various shopping values and the mall attributes and in addition to this will also correlate it with the consumers' age and gender.

abstract={We review approaches to predicting carbon and nitrogen allocation in forest models in terms of their underlying assumptions and their resulting strengths and limitations. Empirical and allometric methods are easily developed and computationally efficient, but lack the power of evolution-based approaches to explain and predict multifaceted effects of environmental variability and climate change. In evolution-based methods, allocation is usually determined by maximization of a fitness proxy, either in a fixed environment, which we call optimal response (OR) models, or including the feedback of an individual's strategy on its environment (game-theoretical optimization, GTO). Optimal response models can predict allocation in single trees and stands when there is significant competition only for one resource. Game-theoretical optimization can be used to account for additional dimensions of competition, e.g., when strong root competition boosts root allocation at the expense of wood production. However, we demonstrate that an OR model predicts similar allocation to a GTO model under the root-competitive conditions reported in free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) experiments. The most evolutionarily realistic approach is adaptive dynamics (AD) where the allocation strategy arises from eco-evolutionary dynamics of populations instead of a fitness proxy. We also discuss emerging entropy-based approaches that offer an alternative thermodynamic perspective on allocation, in which fitness proxies are replaced by entropy or entropy production. To help develop allocation models further, the value of wide-ranging datasets, such as FLUXNET, could be greatly enhanced by ancillary measurements of driving variables, such as water and soil nitrogen availability. © The Author 2011.

abstract={The knowledge of offshore and coastal wave climate evolution towards the end of the twenty-first century is particularly important for human activities in a region such as the Bay of Biscay and the French Atlantic coast. Using dynamical downscaling, a high spatial resolution dataset of wave conditions in the Bay of Biscay is built for three future greenhouse gases emission scenarios. Projected wave heights, periods and directions are analysed at regional scale and more thoroughly at two buoys positions, offshore and along the coast. A general decrease of wave heights is identified (up to -20 cm during summer within the Bay of Biscay), as well as a clockwise shift of summer waves and winter swell coming from direction. The relation between those changes and wind changes is investigated and highlights a complex association of processes at several spatial scales. For instance, the intensification and the northeastward shift of strong wind core in the North Atlantic Ocean explain the clockwise shift of winter swell directions. During summer, the decrease of the westerly winds in the Bay of Biscay explains the clockwise shift and the wave height decrease of Responsible Editor: Eric Deleersnijder E. Charles (B) · D.

This wave height decrease result is consistent with other regional projections and would impact the coastal dynamics by reducing the longshore sediment flux.© The Author(s) 2012.},

abstract={Millions of recommendations, opinions and experiences are shared across popular microblogging platforms and services each day. Yet much of this content becomes quickly lost in the stream shortly after being posted. This paper looks at the feasibility of identifying useful content in microblog streams so that it might be archived to facilitate wider access and reference. Towards this goal, we present an experiment with a game-with-a-purpose called Twiage that we designed to determine how well the deluge of content in "raw" microblog streams could be turned into filtered and ranked collections using ratings from players. Experiments with Twiage validate the feasibility of applying human-computation to this problem, finding strong agreement about what constitutes the "most useful" content in our test dataset. Second, we compare the effectiveness of various methods of eliciting such ratings, finding that a "choose-best" interface and Elo rating ranking scheme yield the greatest agreement in the fewest rounds. External validation of resulting top-rated twitter content with a domain expert found that while the top Twiageranked "tweets" were among the best of the set, there was a tendency for players to also select what we term "weak spam" - e.g., promotional content disguised as articles or reviews, indicating a need for more stringent content filtering.

abstract={Entertainment and gaming systems such as theWii and XBox Kinect have brought touchless, body-movement based interfaces to the masses. Systems like these enable the estimation of movements of various body parts from raw inertial motion or depth sensor data. However, the interface developer is still left with the challenging task of creating a system that recognizes these movements as embodying meaning. The machine learning approach for tackling this problem requires the collection of data sets that contain the relevant body movements and their associated semantic labels. These data sets directly impact the accuracy and performance of the gesture recognition system and should ideally contain all natural variations of the movements associated with a gesture. This paper addresses the problem of collecting such gesture datasets. In particular, we investigate the question of what is the most appropriate semiotic modality of instructions for conveying to human subjects the movements the system developer needs them to perform. The results of our qualitative and quantitative analysis indicate that the choice of modality has a significant impact on the performance of the learnt gesture recognition system; particularly in terms of correctness and coverage.

abstract={Opinionated social media such as product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for their decision making. However, due to the reason of profit or fame, people try to game the system by opinion spamming (e.g., writing fake reviews) to promote or demote some target products. For reviews to reflect genuine user experiences and opinions, such spam reviews should be detected. Prior works on opinion spam focused on detecting fake reviews and individual fake reviewers. However, a fake reviewer group (a group of reviewers who work collaboratively to write fake reviews) is even more damaging as they can take total control of the sentiment on the target product due to its size. This paper studies spam detection in the collaborative setting, i.e., to discover fake reviewer groups. The proposed method first uses a frequent itemset mining method to find a set of candidate groups. It then uses several behavioral models derived from the collusion phenomenon among fake reviewers and relation models based on the relationships among groups, individual reviewers, and products they reviewed to detect fake reviewer groups. Additionally, we also built a labeled dataset of fake reviewer groups. Although labeling individual fake reviews and reviewers is very hard, to our surprise labeling fake reviewer groups is much easier. We also note that the proposed technique departs from the traditional supervised learning approach for spam detection because of the inherent nature of our problem which makes the classic supervised learning approach less effective. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms multiple strong baselines including the state-of-the-art supervised classification, regression, and learning to rank algorithms.},

abstract={The frequencies of words vary with the discourse context, because any given word is more relevant to some topics of discussion than to others. In the statistical natural language processing literature, the term burstiness is used to characterize the tendency of topical words to occur repeatedly in bursts, separated by lulls in which they occur more rarely This article builds on the study of word burstiness by Altmann et al. (PLoS ONE 4:e7678, 2009). The study analyzed the archive of the USENET discussion group talk.origins, developed a novel method for quantifying burstiness, and showed that the burstiness of words is strongly correlated with their semantic type (in the sense of Montague semantics). Using the same dataset, I here explore the burstiness of abstract derived nouns (such as argument) in relation to their verb stems (e.g. argue) and frequency-matched nonderived nouns (such as science). I ask whether the burstiness of the derived form is inherited from the stem along with other stem features, such as the argument structure, or whether it is determined by the deverbal suffix. Overall, derived nouns pattern just like nonderived nouns, indicating that the suffix acts like the morphological head in determining the discourse statistics. This finding is interpreted in the light of Carlson's theory of dialogue games (Carlson in Dialogue games: An approach to discourse analysis. Synthese language library, vol. 17.

abstract={We investigate the directed and weighted complex network of free word associations in which players write a word in response to another word given as input. We analyze in details two large datasets resulting from two very different experiments: On the one hand the massive multiplayer web-based Word Association Game known as Human Brain Cloud, and on the other hand the South Florida Free Association Norms experiment. In both cases, the networks of associations exhibit quite robust properties like the small world property, a slight assortativity and a strong asymmetry between in-degree and out-degree distributions. A particularly interesting result concerns the existence of a characteristic scale for the word association process, arguably related to specific conceptual contexts for each word. After mapping, the Human Brain Cloud network onto the WordNet semantics network, we point out the basic cognitive mechanisms underlying word associations when they are represented as paths in an underlying semantic network. We derive in particular an expression describing the growth of the HBC graph and we highlight the existence of a characteristic scale for the word association process. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Human tracking in dynamic scenes has been an important topic of research. Objects in the world exhibit complex interactions when captured in a video sequence, some interactions manifest themselves as occlusions. A visual tracking system must be able to track objects which are partially or even fully occluded. In this paper, we propose an approach for tracking multiple objects in dynamic scenes to handle objects partial occlusion. The algorithm consists of two steps at first step we use Gaussian Mixture Model as an effective way to extract moving objects from a video sequence. Then a combinational method is used for shadow removal. The second step of the proposed algorithm is object tracking framework based on Kalman filtering which uses Stable Marriage Problem (SMP) implemented algorithm which is adapted to perform data association and occlusion detection, and fast mean shift computation results for tracking during occlusion. Our approach has the advantages of low cost and low complexity, and can be realized in real time system and is tested on using several real world datasets. © 2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Explaining cooperation between non-relatives is a puzzle for both evolutionary biology and the social sciences. In humans, cooperation is often studied in a laboratory setting using economic games such as the prisoners' dilemma. However, such experiments are sometimes criticized for being played for low stakes and by misrepresentative student samples. Golden balls is a televised game show that uses the prisoners' dilemma, with a diverse range of participants, often playing for very large stakes. We use this non-experimental dataset to investigate the factors that influence cooperation when "playing" for considerably larger stakes than found in economic experiments. The game show has earlier stages that allow for an analysis of lying and voting decisions. We found that contestants were sensitive to the stakes involved, cooperating less when the stakes were larger in both absolute and relative terms. We also found that older contestants were more likely to cooperate, that liars received less cooperative behavior, but only if they told a certain type of lie, and that physical contact was associated with reduced cooperation, whereas laughter and promises were reliable signals or cues of cooperation, but were not necessarily detected. © 2012 Burton-Chellew, West.},

abstract={One of the challenges which must be faced in the field of the information processing is the need to cope with huge amounts of data. There exist many different environments in which large quantities of information are produced. For example, in a command-line interface, a computer user types thousands of commands which can hide information about the behavior of her/his. However, processing this kind of streaming data on-line is a hard problem. This paper addresses the problem of the classification of streaming data from a dimensionality reduction perspective. We propose to learn a lower dimensionality input model which best represents the data and improves the prediction performance versus standard techniques. The proposed method uses maximum dependence criteria as distance measurement and finds the transformation which best represents the command-line user. We also make a comparison between the dimensionality reduction approach and using the full dataset. The results obtained give some deeper understanding in advantages and drawbacks of using both perspectives in this user classifying environment. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

From a typical soccer game, for instance, the positions of the 22 players and the ball can be recorded 25 times per second, resulting in approximately 135.000 datasets. Without computational assistance it is almost impossible to extract relevant information from the complete data. This contribution introduces a hierarchical architecture of artificial neural networks to find tactical patterns in those positional data. The results from the classification using the hierarchical setup were compared to the results gained by an expert manually classifying the different categories. Short and long game initiations can be detected with relative high accuracy leading to the conclusion that the hierarchical architecture is capable of recognizing different tactical patterns and variations in these patterns. Remaining problems are discussed and ideas concerning further improvements of classification are indicated. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

From the dataset, one can extract several key characteristics from such scenarios like payload sizes, packet rates, data delivery latencies, retransmission statistics, loss rates and stream correlation. The dataset can be used several ways: by replaying the game traffic, components like congestion control mechanisms, middlewares, packet schedulers, router queue behaviour, etc. can be analysed. Based on the observed statistics from the trace, such interactive game traffic shows completely different behaviour compared to the greedy, high-rate streams most network mechanisms are designed for, e.g., file download, video streaming and web-surfing. We hope that the dataset can be used to push research forward in the field of system support for games. © 2012 ACM.},

abstract={This paper builds on a prior work for player detection, and proposes an efficient and effective method to distinguish among players based on the numbers printed on their jerseys. To extract the numbers, the dominant colors of the jersey are learnt during an initial phase and used to speed up the segmentation of the candidate digit regions. An additional set of criteria, considering the relative position and size (compared to the player bounding box) and the density (compared to the digit rectangular support) of the digit, are used to filter out the regions that obviously do not correspond to a digit. Once the plausible digit regions have been extracted, their recognition is based on feature-based classification. A number of original features are proposed to increase the robustness against digit appearance changes, resulting from the font thickness variability and from the deformations of the jersey during the game. Finally, the efficiency and the effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated on a real-life basketball dataset. It shows that the proposed segmentation runs about ten times faster than the mean-shift algorithm, but also outlines that the proposed additional features significantly increase the digit recognition accuracy. Despite significant deformations, 40% of the samples, that can be visually recognized as digits, are well classified as numbers. Out of these classified samples, more than 80% of them are correctly recognized. Besides, more than 95% of the samples, that are not numbers, are correctly identified as non-numbers. © 2012 SPIE-IS&T.},

abstract={Imagine a physician and a patient doing a search on antibiotic resistance. Or a chess amateur and a grandmaster conducting a search on Alekhine's Defence. Although the topic is the same, arguably the two users in each case will satisfy their information needs with very different texts. Yet today search engines mostly adopt the one-size-fits-all solution, where personalization is restricted to topical preference. We found that users do not uniformly prefer simple texts, and that the text comprehensibility level should match the user's level of preparedness. Consequently, we propose to model the comprehensibility of texts as well as the users' reading proficiency in order to better explain how different users choose content for further exploration. We also model topic-specific reading proficiency, which allows us to better explain why a physician might choose to read sophisticated medical articles yet simple descriptions of SLR cameras. We explore different ways to build user profiles, and use collaborative filtering techniques to overcome data sparsity. We conducted experiments on large-scale datasets from a major Web search engine and a community question answering forum. Our findings confirm that explicitly modeling text comprehensibility can significantly improve content ranking (search results or answers, respectively). Copyright 2012 ACM.},

Further, online commercial services including social networking and micro-blogging websites, ecommerce portals, leisure and entertainment websites, etc. recommend interesting content to users that is simultaneously diverse on many different axes such as topic, geographic specificity, etc. The key algorithmic question in all these applications is the generation of a succinct, representative, and relevant summary from a large stream of data coming from a variety of sources. In this paper, we formally model this optimization problem, identify its key structural characteristics, and use these observations to design an extremely scalable and efficient algorithm. We analyze the algorithm using theoretical techniques to show that it always produces a nearly optimal solution. In addition, we perform large-scale experiments on both real-world and synthetically generated datasets, which confirm that our algorithm performs even better than its analytical guarantees in practice, and also outperforms other candidate algorithms for the problem by a wide margin.

abstract={Machine Learning (ML) for classifying IP traffic has relied on the analysis of statistics of full flows or their first few packets only. However, automated QoS management for interactive traffic flows requires quick and timely classification well before the flows finish. Also, interactive flows are often long-lived and should be continuously monitored during their lifetime. We propose to achieve this by using statistics derived from sub-flows-a small number of most recent packets taken at any point in a flow's lifetime. Then, the ML classifier must be trained on a set of sub-flows, and we investigate different sub-flow selection strategies. We also propose to augment training datasets so that classification accuracy is maintained even when a classifier mixes up client-to-server and server-to-client directions for applications exhibiting asymmetric traffic characteristics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with the Naive Bayes and C4.5 Decision Tree ML algorithms, for the identification of first-person-shooter online game and VoIP traffic. Our results show that we can classify both applications with up to 99% Precision and 95% Recall within less than 1 s. Stable results are achieved regardless of where within a flow the classifier captures the packets and the traffic direction.},

To evaluate the proposed framework, we have integrated MovieLens dataset with IMDB, and empirically shown that the long-tail user groups are useful for the recommendation process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The reform means that public sector workers born on 1 January 1950 or later face a substantial reduction in their pension rights while, for workers born before 1950 nothing changes. We employ a unique-matched survey and administrative dataset comprising male public sector workers born in 1949 and 1950 and find a strong deterioration in mental health for workers affected by the reform. These effects are stronger for married workers whose partner has no pension income. © 2011 The Author(s). The Economic Journal © 2011 Royal Economic Society.},

abstract={Previous works have demonstrated that protein rigidity is related to thermodynamic stability, especially under conditions that favor formation of native structure. Mechanical network rigidity properties of a single conformation are efficiently calculated using the integer body-bar Pebble Game (PG) algorithm. However, thermodynamic properties require averaging over many samples from the ensemble of accessible conformations to accurately account for fluctuations in network topology. We have developed a mean field Virtual Pebble Game (VPG) that represents the ensemble of networks by a single effective network. That is, all possible number of distance constraints (or bars) that can form between a pair of rigid bodies is replaced by the average number. The resulting effective network is viewed as having weighted edges, where the weight of an edge quantifies its capacity to absorb degrees of freedom. The VPG is interpreted as a flow problem on this effective network, which eliminates the need to sample. Across a nonredundant dataset of 272 protein structures, we apply the VPG to proteins for the first time. Our results show numerically and visually that the rigidity characterizations of the VPG accurately reflect the ensemble averaged PḠ properties. This result positions the VPG as an efficient alternative to understand the mechanical role that chemical interactions play in maintaining protein stability. © 2012 González et al.},

abstract={Representing distributions over permutations can be a daunting task due to the fact that the number of permutations of n objects scales factorially in n. One recent way that has been used to reduce storage complexity has been to exploit probabilistic independence, but as we argue, full independence assumptions impose strong sparsity constraints on distributions and are unsuitable for modeling rankings. We identify a novelclass of independence structures, called riffled independence, encompassing a more expressive family of distributions while retaining many of the properties necessary for performing efficient inference and reducing sample complexity. In riffled independence, one draws two permutations independently, then performs the riffle shuffle, common in card games, to combine the two permutations to form a single permutation. Within the context of ranking, riffled independence corresponds to ranking disjoint sets of objects independently, then interleaving those rankings. In this paper, we provide a formal introduction to riffled independence and propose an automated method for discovering sets of items which are riffle independent from a training set of rankings. We show that our clustering-like algorithms can be used to discover meaningful latent coalitions from real preference ranking datasets and to learn the structure of hierarchically decomposable models based on riffled independence.},

abstract={Data-management-as-a-service systems are increasingly being used in collaborative settings, where multiple users access common datasets. Cloud providers have the choice to implement various optimizations, such as indexing or materialized views, to accelerate queries over these datasets. Each optimization carries a cost and may benefit multiple users. This creates a major challenge: how to select which optimizations to perform and how to share their cost among users. The problem is especially challenging when users are selfish and will only report their true values for different optimizations if doing so maximizes their utility. In this paper, we present a new approach for selecting and pricing shared optimizations by using Mechanism Design. We first show how to apply the Shapley Value Mechanism to the simple case of selecting and pricing additive optimizations, assuming an offline game where all users access the service for the same time-period. Second, we extend the approach to online scenarios where users come and go. Finally, we consider the case of substitutive optimizations. We show analytically that our mechanisms induce truthfulness and recover the optimization costs. We also show experimentally that our mechanisms yield higher utility than the state-of-the-art approach based on regret accumulation. © 2012 VLDB Endowment.},

In this paper, we model the interaction between the data miner and the adversary as Stackelberg games. Though existing algorithms for Stackelberg games efficiently find optimal solutions, they critically assume the follower plays optimally and rationally. Unfortunately, in real-world applications, because of follower's bounded rationality and limited observation of the leader's strategy, it may deviate from their expected optimal response. Considering this crucial problem, this paper solve for the Nash equilibrium. Experiments on real spam dataset demonstrate that bounded rationality and limited observation can make Stackelberg games more practical and provide interesting insights about the interaction between the data miner and the spammer in spam filtering. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

Collaborative filtering (CF) and content-based (CB) filtering are the most widely used techniques in personalized recommender systems. CFuses only the user-rating data to make predictions, while CB filtering relies on semantic information of items for recommendation. In this paper we present a new approach taking into account the semantic information of items in a CF system. Many works have addressed this problem by proposing hybrid solutions. In this paper, we present another hybridization technique that predicts users 'preferences for items based on their inferred preferences for semantic information. With this aim, we propose a new approach to build user semantic profile to model users' preferences for semantic information of items. Then, we use this model in a user-based CF algorithm to calculate the similarity between users.

abstract={Recommendation models based on collaborative filtering have good prediction accuracy; however, they have very poor performance in cold-start scenarios, when no or few rating data are associated to certain items or users. An approach for dealing with cold-start problem is to build hybrid models that include content-based filtering. This paper focuses on knowledge-based hybrids that exploit semantic relations among item attributes to enhance traditional models. We investigate novel methods for exploiting this semantics during the recommendation process, in domains where explicit semantic relations among attributes in the form of ontologies are not available. We carry out an extensive performance comparison in which the proposed semantically-enhanced models are evaluated in normal and cold-start scenarios. The experimental results with a publicly available dataset demonstrate superior better performance of the proposed semantically-enhanced models, above all in cold-start scenarios, with respect to a state-of-the-art collaborative-filtering model based on matrix factorization. The proposed models, additionally, provide for interpretable recommendations, in contrast to black-box models. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Since years, online social networks have evolved from profile and communication websites to online portals where people interact with each other, share and consume multimedia-enriched data and play different types of games. Due to the immense popularity of these online games and their huge revenue potential, the number of these games increases every day, resulting in a current offering of thousands of online social games. In this paper, the applicability of neighborhood-based collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms for the recommendation of online social games is evaluated. This evaluation is based on a large dataset of an online social gaming platform containing game ratings (explicit data) and online gaming behavior (implicit data) of millions of active users. Several similarity metrics were implemented and evaluated on the explicit data, implicit data and a combination thereof. It is shown that the neighborhood-based CF algorithms greatly outperform the content-based algorithm, currently often used on online social gaming websites. The results also show that a combined approach, i.e., taking into account both implicit and explicit data at the same time, yields overall good results on all evaluation metrics for all scenarios, while only slightly performing worse compared to the strengths of the explicit or implicit only approaches. The best performing algorithms have been implemented in a live setup of the online game platform. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC & Science Press, China.},

abstract={Objective: This quasi-experimental exploratory study investigated neuropsychological effects of exercise among older adults with diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with adults without diabetes (non-DM), and it examined the feasibility of using a stationary bike exergame as a form of exercise for older adults with and without diabetes. It is a secondary analysis that uses a small dataset from a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the Cybercycle Study, which compared cognitive and physiological effects of traditional stationary cycling versus cybercycling. Methods: In the RCT and the secondary analysis, older adults living in eight independent living retirement facilities in the state of New York were enrolled in the study and assigned to exercise five times per week for 45 min per session (two times per week was considered acceptable for retention in the study) by using a stationary bicycle over the course of 3 months. They were randomly assigned to use either a standard stationary bicycle or a "cybercycle" with a video screen that displayed virtual terrains, virtual tours, and racing games with virtual competitors. For this secondary analysis, participants in the RCT who had type 2 DM (n = 10) were compared with age-matched non-DM exercisers (n = 10). The relationship between exercise and executive function (i.e., Color Trials 2, Digit Span Backwards, and Stroop C tests) was examined for DM and non-DM patients. Results: Older adults with and without diabetes were able to use cybercycles successfully and complete the study, so the feasibility of this form of exercise for this population was supported. However, in contrast with the larger RCT, this small subset did not demonstrate statistically significant differences in executive function between the participants who used cybercycles and those who used stationary bikes with no games or virtual content on a video screen. Therefore, the study combined the two groups and called them "exercisers" and compared cognitive outcomes for DM versus non-DM patients. As predicted, exercisers with DM exhibited significant gains in executive function as measured by the Color Trails 2 test, controlling for age and education, while non-DM exercisers did not significantly gain in this measure [group x time interaction, F(1,16]) = 9.75; p = .007]. Conclusions: These preliminary results support the growing literature that finds that exercise may improve cognition among older adult with DM. Additional research is needed to clarify why certain aspects of executive function might be differentially affected. The current findings may encourage physicians to prescribe exercise for diabetes management and may help motivate DM patients' compliance for engaging in physical activity. © Diabetes Technology Society.},

abstract={For several years, Virginia Tech and other schools have measured the frequency and severity of head impacts sustained by collegiate American football players in real time using the Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System of helmet-mounted accelerometers. In this study, data from 37,128 head impacts collected at Virginia Tech during games from 2006 to 2010 were analyzed. Peak head acceleration exceeded 100 g in 516 impacts, and the Head Injury Criterion (HIC) exceeded 200 in 468 impacts. Four instrumented players in the dataset sustained a concussion. These data were used to develop risk curves for concussion as a function of peak head acceleration and HIC. The validity of this biomechanical approach was assessed using epidemiological data on concussion incidence from other sources. Two specific aspects of concussion incidence were addressed: the variation by player position, and the frequency of repeat concussions. The HIT System data indicated that linemen sustained the highest overall number of head impacts, while skill positions sustained a higher number of more severe head impacts (peak acceleration > 100 g or HIC > 200). When weighted using injury risk curves, the HIT System data predicted a higher incidence of concussion in skill positions compared to linemen at rates that were in strong agreement with the epidemiological literature (Pearson's r = 0.72-0.87). The predicted rates of repeat concussions (21-39% over one season and 33-50% over five seasons) were somewhat higher than the ranges reported in the epidemiological literature. These analyses demonstrate that simple biomechanical parameters that can be measured by the HIT System possess a high level of power for predicting concussion. © 2011 Biomedical Engineering Society.},

abstract={Understanding how a 3D structure of a protein functions depends on predicting which regions are rigid, and which are flexible. One recent approach models molecules as a structure of fixed units (atoms with their bond angles as rigid units, bonds as hinges) plus biochemical constraints coming from the local geometry. This generates a 'molecular graph' in the theory of combinatorial rigidity. The 6V-6 counting condition for 3-dimensional body-hinge structures (modulo molecular theorem), and a fast 'pebble game' algorithm which tracks this count in the multigraph, have led to the development of the program FIRST, for rapid predictions of the flexibility of proteins. In this study we develop a novel protein hinge prediction algorithm via our extension of the pebble game algorithm (relevant regions detection algorithm). We have tested our hinge prediction algorithm on several proteins chosen from the dataset of manually annotated hinges available on the MOLMOV server. Many of our predictions are in very good agreement with this data set. Our algorithms can also predict 'allosteric' interactions in proteins - where binding on one site of a molecule changes the shape or binding at a distance 'active site' of the molecule. We also give some promising results which support the sliding piston-like movement of helices with respect to one another as a plausible mechanism by which GCPR receptors propagate conformational changes across membranes. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract={Sport videos are very popular content among consumers. Many of such videos include overlaid textual data about the game, such as score or player names. But, when the video is viewed on a small screen textual information becomes illegible. In this work we propose a fully automatic system for detecting changes in overlaid textual information, such as the game score. Our system detects text in the video and then marks the spatial and temporal coordinates of where the changes that have occurred in the text. This enables us to make text legible on a small screen by displaying an enlarged score box at the time of score change events. The proposed method was tested on a dataset of different sport videos, collected from YouTube. It achieves good results in terms of accurate spatial score box localization and accurate temporal score-change detection. © 2011 University of Zagreb.},

This paper proposes a feature extraction methodology which is based on frequent sequence mining within and across multiple modalities of user input. The proposed method is applied for the fusion of physiological signals and gameplay information in a game survey dataset. The obtained sequences are analysed and used as predictors of user affect resulting in computational models of equal or higher accuracy compared to the models built on standard statistical features. © 2011 ACM.},

We formalize the audience selection problem as a ranked retrieval task over an index of known users. We focus on the common case of audience selection where a small seed set of users who have previously responded positively to the campaign is used to identify a broader target audience. The actions of the users in the seed set are aggregated to construct a query, the query is then executed against an index of other user profiles to retrieve the highest scoring profiles. We validate our approach on a real-world dataset, demonstrating the trade-offs of different user and query models and that our approach is particularly robust for small campaigns. The proposed user modeling framework is applicable to many other applications requiring user profiles such as content suggestion and personalization. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={Using four exclosures, the impact of mouflon grazing and weather on plant communities of the phytosociological alliances Koelerio-Phleion phleoidis and Hyperico perforati-Scleranthion perennis occurring on shallow soils within a forest landscape was studied in the Křivoklátsko Biosphere Reserve (Czech Republic) during seven years. In the years 2004-2010, the vascular plant species composition was recorded annually on a total of eight fenced and eight control plots, each 2 m × 1 m in size. Treatment, time, and weather data were used as explanatory variables in ordination and correlation analyses. Cover values of different life forms and indicator values varied significantly in dependence on the weather conditions of the preceding five months; however, correlations varied according to the vegetation type and were rather rarely detected. The effect of fencing appeared important in all study plots; however, the temporal trends were significant only in half of them. We did not find a significant interaction between treatment and time in the total dataset. A successional change was detected in one fenced plot only; in all other cases, the species composition fluctuated - a phenomenon that is not directly attributable to weather conditions. In the fenced plots, the herbaceous vegetation cover decreased, mainly due to litter accumulation and partly due to shrub encroachment. At least some parts of the valuable and species-rich habitats could be maintained under high game density, but some parts are endangered by eutrophication and game grazing. Nature conservation management should balance both mechanisms.},

Many games with a purpose focus on generating textual tags for images. In contrast, we introduce a new game, Odd Leaf Out, which provides players with an enjoyable and educational game that serves the purpose of identifying misclassification errors in a large database of labeled leaf images. The game uses a novel mechanism to solicit useful information from players'incorrect answers. A study of 165 players showed that game data can be used to identify mislabeled leaves much more quickly than would have been possible using a computer vision algorithm alone. Domain novices and experts were equally good at identifying mislabeled images, although domain experts enjoyed the game more. We discuss the successes and challenges of this new game, which can be applied to other domains with labeled image datasets. © 2011 IEEE.},

The brody transform makes the approach more robust to rotational, translational invariance's. The experimental was conducted on standard face recognition databases like FGNET age dataset and color FERET dataset. The results demonstrated that our approach reduced memory requirement approximately by 80%, computational time by 70% in comparison with LBP approach while yielding same or even better recognition accuracy.},

abstract={In this paper, we investigate the problem of churn prediction in Massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) from a social science perspective and develop models incorporating theories of player motivation. The ability to predict player churn can be a valuable resource to game developers designing customer retention strategies. The results from our theory-driven model significantly outperform a diffusion-based churn prediction model on the same dataset. We describe the synthesis between a theory-driven approach and a data-driven approach to a problem and examine the trade-offs involved between the two approaches in terms of prediction accuracy, interpretability and model complexity. We observe that even though the theory-driven model is not as accurate as the data-driven one, the theory-driven model itself can be more interpretable to the domain experts and hence, more preferable over a complex data-driven model. We perform lift analysis of the two models and find that if a marketing effort is restricted in the number of customers it can contact, the theory-driven model would offer much better return-on-investment by identifying more customers among that restricted set who have the highest probability of churn. Finally, we use a clustering technique to partition the dataset and then build an ensemble on the partitioned dataset for better performance. Experiment results show that the ensemble performs notably better than the single classifier in terms of its recall value, which is a highly desirable property in the churn prediction problem. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Data mining is the process of extracting patterns from large data sets by combining methods from statistics and artificial intelligence with database management. One of the classes of data mining is classification, where the goal is to generalize a known structure to apply to new data. Supervised learning, a branch of the classification algorithms uses a set of training data to produce an inferred function, called a classifier, which is then used to predict the correct output value for any valid input object. This approach allows supervised learning algorithms to be applied with notable success on games, by predicting the outcome of future matches based on the stored results of previously played matches. We will present the outcome of applying two supervised learning algorithms on a very popular card game, called "Dominion". © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This article conducts a theoretical and empirical analysis of political protest activity surrounding the modern Olympic Games. Although the Olympics are certainly among the world's most prominent and recognized events, they have seldom been explored from a political perspective within the mainstream International Relations and transnational protest literatures. We argue, however, that the Olympics provide a theoretically interesting context in which to examine political contention in International Relations in large part because they provide such a unique opportunity structure for a range of actors to exercise power in pursuit of their goals. The article presents an original dataset of all protest occurring between 1896 and 2008 and uses these data to show that not only has Olympic political contention grown substantially over time, but it also has evolved in interesting ways in terms of the particular actors engaged in contention, the tactics they use, and the resistance they face. Furthermore, we suggest that the study of the Olympics has important implications for understanding the power and power limitations of those actors (including transnational advocacy networks, international institutions, and sovereign states) participating in Olympic protest. © The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={Organizing music by emotional association is a natural process for humans, but the ambiguous nature of emotion makes it a difficult task for machines. Automatic systems for music emotion recognition rely on ground truth data collected from humans, and more effective methods for collecting such data are being continuously developed. In previous work, we developed MoodSwings, an online collaborative game for crowdsourcing dynamic (persecond) mood ratings from multiple players within the twodimensional arousal-valence (A-V) representation of emotion. MoodSwings has proven effective for data collection, but potential data effects caused by collaborative labeling have not yet been analyzed. In this work, we compare the effectiveness of MoodSwings to that of a more traditional data collection method, where annotation is performed by single, paid annotators. We implement a simplified labeling task to run on Amazon's crowdsourcing engine, Mechanical Turk (MTurk), and analyze the labels collected with each method. A statistical comparison shows consistencies between MoodSwings and MTurk data, and we produce similar results using each as training data for automatic emotion production via supervised machine learning. Furthermore the new dataset collected via MTurk has been made available to the Music Information Retrieval community. © 2011 International Society for Music Information Retrieval.},

abstract={Navigation in 3D terrain is considered to be a challenging task and requires virtual camera control skills such as zooming, panning and tilting. Novice users can easily get distracted and disoriented that may result with lost in space. Methods to overcome the virtual environment exploration problems are still being researched to assist users during their journey inside virtual environments. Assisted camera control techniques require viewpoint computation and path planning. This paper introduces a novel approach to navigate over a 3D terrain with minimal loss of information. We exploit the concept of the Viewpoint Entropy for best view determination and use our Greedy N-Best View Selection for visibility calculations. We integrate road network data to extract regions for detailed visibility analysis in subsections of the terrain. In order to connect the calculated viewpoints an evolutionary programming approach for Traveling Salesman problem is used where the distance objective is minimized. The generated tour is presented using Google Earth framework for terrain exploration where we can get real data streams. The computed and planned viewpoints reduces human effort when used as starting points for scene exploration or generating the representative images of the terrain dataset. The proposed framework can be integrated into 3D game engines or any urban visualization system to give quick glimpse or tour of the environment for the novice users without the help of prior planning. © 2011 ACM.},

In this paper, we report our findings on uncovering the association between user's interests of items across domains that are related to each other to a certain degree using two datasets collected from users with different cultural background. Results lead us to believe that due to cultural influences, user preferences over Western and Eastern items (both entertaining item and entertainer) are significantly different. In addition, results suggest the value of the cross-domain RS and reveal that cross-domain recommendation is sensitive to genre among certain domains (Book, Game and Movie), which is valuable for the algorithmic design and implementation of the RS. The results are valuable for the algorithmic design and implementation of the cross-domain RS targeting at users from different countries. Another most significant potential of cross-domain RS is its ability to exploit users' versatile interest on items in different domains to make serendipity and novel recommendations especially in large-scale commercial systems. © 2011 AICIT.},

abstract={The increasing cybercrime trend places increased pressures on struggling organizations to defend themselves from an influx of custom malware attacks. These customized 'cyber weapons' are undetectable to antivirus signature-based scanners and difficult to detect with heuristic-based scanners. Governments and many organizations simply cannot wait for commercial malware detection solutions, because researchers likely will never receive a targeted malware artifact-it may be the only instance in existence-unless the customer first finds it themselves and submits it for review. Unbeknownst to many antivirus customers, who mistakenly think they are watching the malware game from the safety and security of the sidelines, wily cyber criminals have quietly begun targeting them as the weakest players on the field. While several critical malware problems remain the focus of intense research, this research paper investigates methods of automatically identifying disparities between malware types using machine learning techniques. The results from these experiments can help all interested entities to better identify and classify specific artifacts that they discover possibly even enabling more expedient recovery procedures. Other applications of these methods include automatically classifying malware types for large malware repositories or assisting antivirus researcher agreement on a specific universal malware type standard. Fostering agreement in the antivirus research community on a universal type standard benefits both the research community and antivirus customers, because standards allow for effective and appropriate response and recovery procedures. These standards also allow academic research efforts to effectively leverage the expertise of the antivirus researcher community. Preliminary results on relatively small datasets demonstrate reasonable confidence in classification accuracy for three different malware types based on partial and full agreement between three major antivirus company products. This methodology serves as a quick look classification for identification and prioritization of work for appropriate information technology personnel. Increasing the number of samples, applying a variety of machine learning techniques, and incorporating other software types to this research will increase the significance of these results and help to define the essence of various software classes.},

While there has been considerable research on the motivations and communication of people online, as well as the social environment provided by online services, large-scale analyses of the virtual identities people use online are rare. In this paper, the first large-scale analysis of virtual identities in the massively multi-player online game WORLD OF WARCRAFT® is presented based on a dataset of nearly eight million avatar names and associated information. The results presented highlight the inventiveness of the names the users of WORLD OF WARCRAFT® express in terms of naming their virtual identities and the varied nature of the sources of inspiration for these names, which range from mythology, literature, popular culture, real-world names and others. The results also indicate that how players name their characters is influenced by the aesthetics and game function of the characters. The server type also appears to have an impact on player naming strategies, with role-playing servers forming a distinct cluster from Player-vs-Player type servers. Additionally, the analysis presented reveals that character name frequencies follow, similar to real-world names, a power law distribution. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Critical to natural human-robot interaction is the capability of robots to detect the contingent reactions by humans. In various interaction scenarios, a robot can recognize a human's intention by detecting the presence or absence of a human response to its interactive signal. In our prior work [1], we addressed the problem of detecting visible reactions by developing a method of detecting changes in human behavior resulting from a robot signal. We extend the previous behavior change detector by integrating multiple cues using a mechanism that operates at two levels of information integration and then adaptively applying these cues based on their reliability. We propose a new method for evaluating reliability of cues online during interaction. We perform a data collection experiment with help of the Wizard-of-Oz methodology in a turn-taking scenario in which a humanoid robot plays the turn-taking imitation game "Simon says" with human partners. Using this dataset, which includes motion and body pose cues from a depth and color image, we evaluate our contingency detection module with the proposed integration mechanisms and show the importance of selecting the appropriate level of cue integration. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Ideas, ranging from product preferences to political views, spread through social interactions. These interactions may determine how ideas are adopted within a market and which, if any, become dominant. In this paper, we introduce a model for Dynamic Influence in Competitive Environments (DICE). We show that existing models of influence propagation, including linear threshold and independent cascade models, can be derived as special cases of DICE. Using DICE, we explore two scenarios of competing ideas, including the case where a newcomer competes with a leader with an already-established idea, as well as the case where multiple competing ideas are introduced simultaneously. We formulate the former as a Stackelberg game and the latter as a simultaneous-move game of complete information. Moreover, we show that, in both cases, the payoff functions for both players are submodular, leading to efficient algorithms for each player to approximate his optimal strategy. We illustrate our approach using the Wiki-vote social network dataset. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Dogsperate Escape is a visually attractive exercise game that allows the player to perform various activities, provoking physical exercises with a memorable experience. This paper presents an implementation of the motion control module in the game based on a bio-inspired, accelerometer embedded e-AR sensor. The acceleration signals from the device are wirelessly transmitted to the PC for real-time activity analysis. A real-time activity recognition algorithm has been constructed based on pre-collected datasets acquired from ten subjects while performing a simple pre-defined activity routine. The algorithm is validated on eleven different subjects while performing another activity routine. By integrating the algorithm into the game, the recognized activities can be mapped into specific input commands for character control. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Recent studies have explored the organization of player movements in team sports using a range of statistical tools. However, the factors that best explain the performance of association football teams remain elusive. Arguably, this is due to the high-dimensional behavioural outputs that illustrate the complex, evolving configurations typical of team games. According to dynamical system analysts, movement patterns in team sports exhibit nonlinear self-organizing features. Nonlinear processing tools (i.e. Artificial Neural Networks; ANNs) are becoming increasingly popular to investigate the coordination of participants in sports competitions. ANNs are well suited to describing high-dimensional data sets with nonlinear attributes, however, limited information concerning the processes required to apply ANNs exists. This review investigates the relative value of various ANN learning approaches used in sports performance analysis of team sports focusing on potential applications for association football. Sixty-two research sources were summarized and reviewed from electronic literature search engines such as SPORTDiscus™, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, Scirus, ScienceDirect and Elsevier. Typical ANN learning algorithms can be adapted to perform pattern recognition and pattern classification. Particularly, dimensionality reduction by a Kohonen feature map (KFM) can compress chaotic high-dimensional datasets into low-dimensional relevant information. Such information would be useful for developing effective training drills that should enhance self-organizing coordination among players. We conclude that ANN-based qualitative analysis is a promising approach to understand the dynamical attributes of association football players. © 2011 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.},

First, plausible ball candidates are detected on the nodes of a 3D grid defined around the basket. This is done by correlating independently in each view the spatial template of the ball with a precomputed foreground mask. Efficient implementation of this step relies on integral images. Afterwards, false positives are filtered out based on a temporal analysis of the ball trajectory. This analysis builds on the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) method, with a ballistic trajectory model. The integrated approach is demonstrated on a real-life dataset, and appears to be both effective and efficient. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={In 2009, an average American spent 3 hours per day watching TV. Recent advances in TV entertainment technologies, such as on-demand content, browsing the Internet, and 3D displays, have changed the traditional role of the TV and turned it into the center of home entertainment. Most of these technologies are personal and would benefit from seamless identification of who sits in front of the TV. In this work, we propose a practical and highly accurate solution to this problem. This solution uses a camera, which is mounted on a TV, to recognize faces of people in front of the TV. To make the approach practical, we employ online learning on graphs and show that we can learn highly accurate face models in difficult circumstances from as little as one labeled example. To evaluate our solutions, we collected a 10-hour long dataset of 8 people who watch TV. Our precision and recall are in the upper nineties, and show the promise of utilizing our approach in an embedded setting.

We present an approach for modeling player retention in Madden NFL 11, a commercial football game. Our approach encodes gameplay patterns of specific players as feature vectors and models player retention as a regression problem. By building an accurate model of player retention, we are able to identify which gameplay elements are most influential in maintaining active players.

abstract={Most state-of-the-art iris recognition algorithms claim to perform with a very high recognition accuracy in a strictly controlled environment. However, their recognition accuracies significantly decrease when the acquired images are affected by different noise factors including motion blur, camera diffusion, head movement, gaze direction, camera angle, reflections, contrast, luminosity, eyelid and eyelash occlusions, and problems due to contraction and dilation. The novelty of this research effort is that we propose to apply a variational model to localize the iris region belonging to given shape space using active contour method, a geometric shape prior, and the Mumford-Shah functional. This variational model is robust against noise, poor localization and weak iris/sclera boundaries. Furthermore, we apply the Modified Contribution-Selection Algorithm (MCSA) for iris feature ranking based on the Multi-Perturbation Shapley Analysis (MSA), a framework which relies on cooperative game theory to estimate the effectiveness of the features iteratively and select them accordingly, using either forward selection or backward elimination approaches. The verification and identification performance of the proposed scheme is validated using the ICE 2005, the UBIRIS Version 1, the CASIA Version 3 Interval, and WVU Nonideal datasets. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

We apply a strict crossvalidation framework to test the generalization capability of the models when facing physiological data coming from a new user. We show that, when generalization is the goal, complex non-linear models trained using fancy strategies might easily get trapped by overfitting, while linear ones might be preferable. Although this could be expected, the only way to appreciate it has to pass through proper cross-validation, and this is often forgot when rushing in the "best" performance challenge. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={3D interfaces use motion sensing, physical input, and spatial interaction techniques to effectively control highly dynamic virtual content. Now, with the advent of the Nintendo Wii, Sony Move, and Microsoft Kinect, game developers and researchers must create compelling interface techniques and game-play mechanics that make use of these technologies. At the same time, it is becoming increasingly clear that emerging game technologies are not just going to change the way we play games, they are also going to change the way we make and view art, design new products, analyze scientific datasets, and more. This introduction to 3D spatial interfaces demystifies the workings of modern videogame motion controllers and provides an overview of how it is used to create 3D interfaces for tasks such as 2D and 3D navigation, object selection and manipulation, and gesture-based application control. Topics include the strengths and limitations of various motion-controller sensing technologies in today's peripherals, useful techniques for working with these devices, and current and future applications of these technologies to areas beyond games. The course presents valuable information on how to utilize existing 3D user-interface techniques with emerging technologies, how to develop interface techniques, and how to learn from the successes and failures of spatial interfaces created for a variety of application domains. © 2011 ACM.},

By de-anonymizing much of the competition test set using our own Flickr crawl, we were able to effectively game the competition. Our attack represents a new application of de-anonymization to gaming machine learning contests, suggesting changes in how future competitions should be run. We introduce a new simulated annealing-based weighted graph matching algorithm for the seeding step of de-anonymization. We also show how to combine de-anonymization with link predictionthe latter is required to achieve good performance on the portion of the test set not de-anonymizedfor example by training the predictor on the de-anonymized portion of the test set, and combining probabilistic predictions from de-anonymization and link prediction. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: With the advance of genome sequencing technologies, phenotyping, rather than genotyping, is becoming the most expensive task when mapping genetic traits. The need for efficient selective phenotyping strategies, i.e. methods to select a subset of genotyped individuals for phenotyping, therefore increases. Current methods have focused either on improving the detection of causative genetic variants or their precise genomic location separately.Results: Here we recognize selective phenotyping as a Bayesian model discrimination problem and introduce SPARE (Selective Phenotyping Approach by Reduction of Entropy). Unlike previous methods, SPARE can integrate the information of previously phenotyped individuals, thereby enabling an efficient incremental strategy. The effective performance of SPARE is demonstrated on simulated data as well as on an experimental yeast dataset.Conclusions: Using entropy reduction as an objective criterion gives a natural way to tackle both issues of detection and localization simultaneously and to integrate intermediate phenotypic data. We foresee entropy-based strategies as a fruitful research direction for selective phenotyping. © 2011 Gagneur et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

Using data on players’ international career backgrounds and team performance from the FIFA World Cup 2006, the authors test two hypotheses linking experiential diversity in teams and a measure of relative team performance. The dataset includes detailed individual background profiles of the 736 participating players and performance data from the 64 games played at the tournament. FindingsThe findings suggest that different types of experiential diversity have contrasting effects on team performance in a time-limited project team setting. Research limitations/implicationsThese findings encourage team diversity researchers to further examine the impact of experiential diversity in teams on team process and performance outcomes in future research. Practical implicationsThe findings particularly highlight the need to carefully manage experiential diversity in project team settings in order to benefit from access to diverse tacit resources, while at the same time avoiding that the integrative capacities of teams becoming overstretched. Originality/valueThe paper is a step towards a better understanding of how diversity of individual career backgrounds affects team performance outcomes in project teams. © 2011, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={Numerous recent studies have examined the impact of video gaming on various dependent variables, including the players' affective reactions, positive as well as detrimental cognitive effects, and real-world aggression. These target variables are typically analyzed as a function of game characteristics and player attributes-especially gender. However, findings on the uneven distribution of gaming experience between males and females, on the one hand, and the effect of gaming experience on several target variables, on the other hand, point at a possible confound when gaming experiments are analyzed with a standard analysis of variance. This study uses simulated data to exemplify analysis of regression residuals as a potentially beneficial data analysis strategy for such datasets. As the actual impact of gaming experience on each of the various dependent variables differs, the ultimate benefits of analysis of regression residuals entirely depend on the research question, but it offers a powerful statistical approach to video game research whenever gaming experience is a confounding factor. © Copyright 2011, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between primary product network size and the sales of complementary products, and to suggest customer characteristics moderating this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: A panel dataset in the online video game industry was used to verify the proposed theoretical framework. Two-level hierarchical linear modeling is used to test several hypotheses. Findings: The authors' analysis results suggest there is a positive relationship between the primary product network size and the sales of complementary products. Also, two customer characteristics (previous transaction value and customer purchase frequency) were found to positively influence the complementary product sales. The primary product's network size has a stronger impact on complementary product sales for light buyers compared to heavy buyers. Research limitations/implications: This study only focused on online video industry, and the price differentiation of the products might not be adequately significant. Other relevant factors (such as word-of-mouth (WOM)) or other customer characteristics could also be relevant to complementary product sales. Therefore, future research could use data triangulation to collect data in different contexts, through a longer period of time, to test and verify the proposed relationships. Practical implications: Product managers need to better understand the relationship between the primary product network size and the complementary product sales. They should adjust the marketing strategies toward different customer purchase frequency segments correspondingly. For example, to benefit further from the primary product network size, complementary product retailers can create online forums for all primary product users to influence light complementary product buyers. Originality/value: This research is one of the first empirical investigations of establishing the relationship between primary product network size and complementary product sales, with customer characteristics as moderators. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={The present study examines the influence of coastal marine protected areas (MPA s) and statewide fishing regulations on recreational trophy fisheries for four important estuarine game fishes in Florida, where ~59% of the mainland coast consists of MPA s. The distribution of International Game Fish Association (IGFA ) recreational world records achieved over 70 years (1939-2009) were correlated with the strength and duration of fishery restrictions in MPA s. No difference in record density was detected between coastal areas inside and outside of MPA s where fishing was managed by statewide regulations. However, 74% (n = 143) of all records for three species were concentrated near the two MPA s that had additional fishery restrictions. The highest concentration was along ~11% of the mainland coast at Cape Canaveral (CAN ) near MPA s closed to all fishing since 1962. It included 42% of spotted seatrout [Cynoscion nebulosus (Cuvier in Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1830)], 55% of red drum [Sciaenops ocellatus (Linnaeus, 1766)], and 69% of black drum [Pogonias cromis (Linnaeus, 1766)] Florida records. Everglades National Park (ENP ) had the second highest concentration with 7% of spotted seatrout, 32% of red drum, and 24% of black drum records caught along ∼9% of the mainland coast. ENP partially limited fishing starting in 1980 by establishing a closed area, daily bag limits, and eliminating commercial fishing. Common snook [Centropomus undecimalis (Bloch, 1792)] records did not increase significantly at CAN or ENP . Recreational fishery statistics corroborated IGFA record patterns. Total recreational catch and catch per trip (CPUE ) increased significantly for spotted seatrout, red drum, and black drum in northeast and southwest Florida, the two regions with the most protective MPA s, and either declined or were unchanged in the northeast and southeast, which did not have MPA s with fishing restrictions. Both datasets supported predictions of marine reserve theory that MPA s can benefit fisheries by increasing the abundance and size of exploited species. Data did not support other alternative hypotheses proposed to explain record patterns. In conclusion, evidence indicates that Florida coastal estuarine MPA s with fishery restrictions allowed recreational anglers to increase their total catch and CPUE , and achieve more game fish world records than would have occurred if all coastal areas had been regulated by existing statewide fishing regulations. © 2011 Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science of the University of Miami.},

abstract={With hundreds of millions of users worldwide, social networks provide incredible opportunities for social connection, learning, political and social change, and individual entertainment and enhancement in a wide variety of forms. In light of these notable outcomes, understanding information diffusion over online social networks is a critical research goal. Because many social interactions currently take place in online networks, we now have have access to unprecedented amounts of information about social interaction. Prior to the advent of such online networks, investigations about social behavior required resource-intensive activities such as random trials, surveys, and manual data collection to gather even small data sets. Now, massive amounts of information about social networks and social interactions are recorded. This wealth of data can allow us to study social interactions on a scale and at a level of detail that has never before been possible. We present an integrated approach to information diffusion in online social networks focusing on three key problems: (1) Querying and analysis of online social network datasets; (2) Modeling and analysis of social networks; and (3) Analysis of social media and social interactions in the contemporary media environment. The overarching goals are to generate a greater understanding of social interactions in online networks through data analysis, to develop reliable and scalable models that can predict outcomes of these social processes, and ultimately to create applications that can shape the outcome of these processes. We start by developing and refining models of information diffusion based on real-world data sets. We next address the problem of finding influential users in this data-driven framework. It is equally important to identify techniques that can slow or prevent the spread of misinformation, and hence algorithms are explored to address this question. A third interest is the process by which a social group forms opinions about an idea or product, and we therefore describe preliminary approaches to create models that accurately capture the opinion formation process in online social networks. While questions relating to the propagation of a single news item or idea are important, these information campaigns do not exist in isolation. Therefore, our proposed approach also addresses the interplay of the many information diffusion processes that take place simultaneously in a network and the relative importance of different topics or trends over multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Automating the annotation process of digital images is a crucial step towards efficient and effective management of this increasingly high volume of content. It is, nevertheless, an extremely challenging task for the research community. One of the main bottle necks is the lack of integrity and diversity of features. We solve this problem by proposing to utilize 43 image features that cover the holistic content of the image from global to subject, background, and scene. In our approach, saliency regions and background are separated without prior knowledge. Each of them together with the whole image is treated independently for feature extraction. Extensive experiments were designed to show the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach. We chose two publicly available datasets manually annotated and with the diverse nature of images for our experiments, namely, the Corel5k and ESP Game datasets. They contain 5,000 images with 260 keywords and 20,770 images with 268 keywords, respectively. Through empirical experiments, it is confirmed that by using our features with the state-of-the-art technique, we achieve superior performance in many metrics, particularly in auto-annotation. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Churn is the movement of customers from one mobile network operator to another. It is always better to retain a customer than having to find a new customer in the present competitive environment and the importance of this fact can't be stressed enough. Being more of a social phenomenon than a mathematical one the existing models fail in prediction of such a behavioral quantity. Churn prediction is valuable to the mobile operator depending on the level of accuracy of predictions. This paper presents predictive modeling of customer behavior based on the application of hybrid learning approaches for churn prediction in the mobile network. Our proposed framework deals with a better and more accurate churner prediction technique compared to the existing ones as it incorporates hybrid learning method which is a combination of tree induction system and genetic programming to derive the rules for classification based on the customer behavior. Finally using the game theory techniques we understand the community effect of churn. We calculated the predicted score which is a churn value of a mobile customer. The proposed model is used for prediction of various user defined groupings based on usage time, location and their underlying social network, thus making it a pragmatic approach which models churn on human level than a mathematical level. The post evaluation results on a real world dataset from a leading operator validate our findings. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Finding who and what is "important" is an ever-occurring question. Many methods that aim at characterizing important items or influential individuals have been developed in areas such as, bibliometrics, social-network analysis, link analysis, and web search. In this paper we study the problem of attributing influence scores to individuals who accomplish tasks in a collaborative manner. We assume that individuals build small teams, in different and diverse ways, in order to accomplish atomic tasks. For each task we are given an assessment of success or importance score, and the goal is to attribute those team-wise scores to the individuals. The challenge we face is that individuals in strong coalitions are favored against individuals in weaker coalitions, so the objective is to find fair attributions that account for such biasing. We propose an iterative algorithm for solving this problem that is based on the concept of Shapley value. The proposed method is applicable to a variety of scenarios, for example, attributing influence scores to scientists who collaborate in published articles, or employees of a company who participate in projects. Our method is evaluated on two real datasets: ISI Web of Science publication data and the Internet Movie Database. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={This paper explores, from a theoretical and technical point of view, the role of head rotation and eye gaze directionality to the human perception of attention from nonverbal cues. We have annotated two different versions of the same dataset, in order to correlate the above parameters with the degree people have considered people in the dataset pay attention to a hypothetical task they have in front of them. Based on our findings, we investigate the role of eye gaze directionality in relation to head rotations and, based on previous studies, we developed an algorithm for estimating attention levels from head pose, eye gaze and facial feature spatial locations. With the help of our AI system and people's annotation, we have made a first attempt towards quantifying the role of each cue to the overall estimation of attention. One of the important properties of the technical part of this work is that all systems we used were non-intrusive and did not demand any personal training or calibration phase, constituting themselves ideal for Game playing. Knowing the behavioral state of a player can be of vital importance for adapting the game design during interaction, or building personal profiles, leading to appropriate game features aiming at maximizing player satisfaction. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Rough set feature selection (RSFS) can be used to improve classifier performance. RSFS removes redundant attributes whilst retaining important ones that preserve the classification power of the original dataset. Reducts are feature subsets selected by RSFS. Core is the intersection of all the reducts of a dataset. RSFS can only handle discrete attributes, hence, continuous attributes need to be discretized before being input to RSFS. Discretization determines the core size of a discrete dataset. However, current discretization methods do not consider the core size during discretization. Earlier work has proposed core-generating approximate minimum entropy discretization (C-GAME) algorithm which selects the maximum number of minimum entropy cuts capable of generating a non-empty core within a discrete dataset. The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) the C-GAME algorithm is improved by adding a new type of constraint to eliminate the possibility that only a single reduct is present in a C-GAME-discrete dataset; (2) performance evaluation of C-GAME in comparison to C4.5, multi-layer perceptrons, RBF networks and k-nearest neighbours classifiers on ten datasets chosen from the UCI Machine Learning Repository; (3) performance evaluation of C-GAME in comparison to Recursive Minimum Entropy Partition (RMEP), Chimerge, Boolean Reasoning and Equal Frequency discretization algorithms on the ten datasets; (4) evaluation of the effects of C-GAME and the other four discretization methods on the sizes of reducts; (5) an upper bound is defined on the total number of reducts within a dataset; (6) the effects of different discretization algorithms on the total number of reducts are analysed; (7) performance analysis of two RSFS algorithms (a genetic algorithm and Johnson's algorithm). © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Gaming services are popular for Internet users. How to broadcast live gaming scenes to large-scale users over internet is a big problem. Traditional schemes have poor user experiences, cost large bandwidth consumption. In order to lower down the broadcast dataset, some solutions propose an alternative approach based on game data content delivery instead of video content. At present, these works are based on client/server model, which is hard to scale. In this paper, we introduce PKLIVE, a game observing system based on peer-to-peer (P2P) model. PKLIVE system broadcasts game data content to reduce bandwidth consumption, maintains a P2P overlay for each gaming channel and adopt a reliable UDP protocol to break the limitation of the TCP connections, decentralizes servers to enhance system's availability and scalability. Preliminary tests show that PKLIVE works well, low-latency, low bandwidth consumption and very considerable bandwidth savings for game service providers. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract={There is a growing interest in the use of simulations and games in Dutch higher education. This development is based on the perception that students belong to the 'gamer generation' or 'net generation': a generation that has grown up with computer games and other technology affecting their preferred learning styles, social interaction patterns and technology use generally. It is often argued that in education this generation prefers active, collaborative and technology-rich learning, i.e. learning methods that involve extensive computer use and collaboration among students. Gaming is then proposed as a new teaching method which addresses these requirements. This article presents the results of a survey which studied whether this discourse is also applicable to higher education students from the Netherlands and whether games, considered as active, collaborative and technology-rich learning experiences, are of greater importance in the formal education of today's students. Of 1432 respondents from eight Dutch institutes of higher education surveyed between 2005 and 2009, about 25% fit our criteria of being a clear representative of the net generation. Furthermore, our analysis shows that there is little difference, and no statistically significant difference, in active, collaborative and technology-rich learning preferences between the representatives and non-representatives of the net generation. Furthermore, no large or statistically significant differences were found between representatives and non-representatives of the net generation with respect to the value they accorded to gaming in education. Overall our dataset did not fit the expectations raised by the net generation theory, with the percentage of students who fit the criteria being much lower than expected. However, regardless of whether they represented the net generation or not, in general our respondents preferred collaborative and technology-rich learning and deemed games a valuable teaching method. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Spatio temporal data displayed in a spatial layout are not the best visualization for simultaneously exploring visitor paths and comparing their residing time. A challenging problem is the visual analytics of circulation patterns in varying layouts commonly found in both real and virtual environments. A circulation pattern is defined as how visitors move within space regarding a sequence of visited items. Understanding and discovering the circulation patterns has received much attention from space designers for increasing visitor satisfaction. This paper proposes a layout-independent visualization approach that transforms the four dimensional data of visitor trajectories (3D-position + time) into time series data. Onetime series datum represents a visitor path and his/her time spent residing in each particular region. In our visualization, we encode a time interval residing in an item boundary into a line segment. The length of a segment is in proportion to the total time spent in the layout. The time segment is placed in the row corresponding to its item boundary. A path of visited items is illustrated by connecting the time segments with vertical lines. The resulting visualization technique, called Path And Residing Time displaY (PARTY), enables users to find trends of circulation behaviors in a consistent fashion regardless of the targeted layout. The scalability of PARTY can be enhanced by a clustering technique which we enable PARTY to handle real data of more than two thousand visitors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PARTY on these datasets. First, we show circulation behaviors of visiting styles in a 3D virtual museum. Second, we illustrate a flow of people who escaped from an explosive in a building. Third, we analyze players' patterns in a massively multiplayer online game, named Angel Love Online. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={Web users exhibit a variety of navigational interests through clicking a sequence of Web pages. Analyses of Web usage data will lead to discovering Web user access patterns, and in turn, facilitating users to locate more preferable Web contents via collaborative recommendation techniques. In the context of Web usage mining, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) based on probability inference provides a promising approach to capture not only user hidden navigational patterns, but also the associations between users, pages and hidden navigational patterns. The discovered user access patterns could be used as a usage reference base for identifying the new user's access preferences and making usage-based collaborative Web recommendations. In this paper, we propose a novel usage-based Web recommendation framework, in which Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is employed to learn the underlying task space from the training Web log data and infer the task distribution for a target user via task inference. The main advantages of the adapted LDA model are its capabilities of efficiently learning the semantic usage information from the Web log data and effectively inferring the access preference of the target user even with a few Web clicks that might be unseen in the training data. In this paper, we also investigate the determination of an optimizing task number, which is another important problem commonly encountered in latent semantic analysis. Experiments conducted on a real Web log dataset show that this approach can achieve better recommendation performance in comparison to other existing techniques. And the discovered task-simplex expression can also provide a better interpretation for Web designers or users to better understand the user navigational preference. © 2011 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Database technology remains underused in science, especially in the long tail - the small labs and individual researchers that collectively produce the majority of scientific output. These researchers increasingly require iterative, ad hoc analysis over ad hoc databases but cannot individually invest in the computational and intellectual infrastructure required for state-of-the-art solutions. We describe a new "delivery vector" for database technology called SQLShare that emphasizes ad hoc integration, query, sharing, and visualization over pre-defined schemas. To empower non-experts to write complex queries, we synthesize example queries from the data itself and explore limited English hints to augment the process. We integrate collaborative visualization via a web-based service called VizDeck that uses automated visualization techniques with a card game metaphor to allow creation of interactive visual dashboards in seconds with zero programming. We present data on the initial uptake and usage of the system and report preliminary results testingout new features with the datasets collected during the initial pilot deployment. We conclude that the SQLShare system and associated services have the potential to increase uptake of relational database technology in the long tail of science. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Data integration methods enable different data providers to flexibly integrate their expertise and deliver highly customizable services to their customers. Nonetheless, combining data from different sources could potentially reveal person-specific sensitive information. In VLDBJ 2006, Jiang and Clifton (Very Large Data Bases J (VLDBJ) 15(4):316-333, 2006) propose a secure Distributed k-Anonymity (DkA) framework for integrating two private data tables to a k-anonymous table in which each private table is a vertical partition on the same set of records. Their proposed DkA framework is not scalable to large data sets. Moreover, DkA is limited to a two-party scenario and the parties are assumed to be semi-honest. In this paper, we propose two algorithms to securely integrate private data from multiple parties (data providers). Our first algorithm achieves the k-anonymity privacy model in a semi-honest adversary model. Our second algorithm employs a game-theoretic approach to thwart malicious participants and to ensure fair and honest participation of multiple data providers in the data integration process. Moreover, we study and resolve a real-life privacy problem in data sharing for the financial industry in Sweden. Experiments on the real-life data demonstrate that our proposed algorithms can effectively retain the essential information in anonymous data for data analysis and are scalable for anonymizing large data sets. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) is important for understanding the genetic regulatory system, but weak conservation of TFBSs poses a challenge in computational biology. In this study, we propose a method based on the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to discover DNA motifs (collections of TFBSs) in a set of bio-sequences. In our method, ACO builds candidate motifs to search for putative binding sites amid the given sequences. The EM algorithm is then applied to maximize the likelihood of a motif model being constructed from the corresponding binding sites. In ACO, each artificial ant mimics the foraging behavior of social insects to construct a possible motif by sensing the pheromones laid on each nucleotide. Due to stability issues with metaheuristic approaches, we incorporate the EM algorithm in our method to improve the reliability of binding site predictions. In the final step, a statistically-based procedure is applied to refine the predictions for compliance with real biological conditions. Experiments conducted on real test datasets indicate that the proposed method identifies binding sites with higher accuracy and reliability than two other motif discovery tools, namely GAME and GALF.},

abstract={Many models in computer education and assessment take into account difficulty. However, despite the positive results of models that take difficulty in to account, knowledge tracing is still used in its basic form due to its skill level diagnostic abilities that are very useful to teachers. This leads to the research question we address in this work: Can KT be effectively extended to capture item difficulty and improve prediction accuracy? There have been a variety of extensions to KT in recent years. One such extension was Baker's contextual guess and slip model. While this model has shown positive gains over KT in internal validation testing, it has not performed well relative to KT on unseen in-tutor data or post-test data, however, it has proven a valuable model to use alongside other models. The contextual guess and slip model increases the complexity of KT by adding regression steps and feature generation. The added complexity of feature generation across datasets may have hindered the performance of this model. Therefore, one of the aims of our work here is to make the most minimal of modifications to the KT model in order to add item difficulty and keep the modification limited to changing the topology of the model. We analyze datasets from two intelligent tutoring systems with KT and a model we have called KT-IDEM (Item Difficulty Effect Model) and show that substantial performance gains can be achieved with this minor modification that incorporates item difficulty. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

In this research, we analyze 1,005,296 user interactions with a real time search engine over a 190 day period. Using query log analysis, we investigate searching behavior, categorize search topics, and measure the economic value of this real time search stream. We examine aggregate usage of the search engine, including number of users, queries, and terms. We then classify queries into subject categories using the Google Directory topical hierarchy. We next estimate the economic value of the real time search traffic using the Google AdWords keyword advertising platform. Results shows that 30% of the queries were unique (used only once in the entire dataset), which is low compared to traditional Web searching. Also, 60% of the search traffic comes from the search engine's application program interface, indicating that real time search is heavily leveraged by other applications. There are many repeated queries over time via these application program interfaces, perhaps indicating both long term interest in a topic and the polling nature of real time queries. Concerning search topics, the most used terms dealt with technology, entertainment, and politics, reflecting both the temporal nature of the queries and, perhaps, an early adopter user-based. However, 36% of the queries indicate some geographical affinity, pointing to a location-based aspect to real time search. In terms of economic value, we calculate this real time search stream to be worth approximately US $33,000,000 (US $33 M) on the online advertising market at the time of the study. We discuss the implications for search engines and content providers as real time content increasingly enters the main stream as an information source. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Structural econometric auction models with explicit game-theoretic modeling of bidding strategies have been quite a challenge from a methodological perspective, especially within the common value framework. We develop a Bayesian analysis of the hierarchical Gaussian common value model with stochastic entry introduced by Bajari and Hortac ̧su. A key component of our approach is an accurate and easily interpretable analytical approximation of the equilibrium bid function, resulting in a fast and numerically stable evaluation of the likelihood function. We extend the analysis to situations with positive valuations using a hierarchical gamma model. We use a Bayesian variable selection algorithm that simultaneously samples the posterior distribution of the model parameters and does inference on the choice of covariates. The methodology is applied to simulated data and to a newly collected dataset from eBay with bids and covariates from 1000 coin auctions. We demonstrate that the Bayesian algorithm is very efficient and that the approximation error in the bid function has virtually no effect on the model inference. Both models fit the data well, but the Gaussian model outperforms the gamma model in an out-of-sample forecasting evaluation of auction prices.

abstract={While the health benefits of exercise are wide-ranging and wellknown, the population of the United States is suffering from a lack of physical activity. We believe that combining elements of social interaction with exercise in video games will lead to increased and sustained engagement in physical activity. In this paper, we present an initial design of GameChanger, a middleware to support the development of a new generation of social exergames that interweave physical activity as a core game mechanic with social elements such as competition and collaboration. The GameChanger middleware provides programming abstractions that are specific to social exergame mechanics, elevating their description so that even non-expert programmers can create interesting social exergames that utilize mobile phones and sensing technology to integrate physical activity into gameplay. In addition, the middleware provides constructs for performing continuous assessment of physical activity during gameplay; these constructs can be used to provide feedback to the gameplayer or to collect datasets for evaluation by health researchers. As such, the GameChanger middleware can also serve as a platform to support scientific experimentation and exploration to determine which combinations of social and physical elements have the greatest impact on physical activity. © 2011 ACM.},

abstract={In this paper, we introduce a framework for modeling elements of "team chemistry" in the skill assessment process using the performances of subsets of teams and four approaches which make use of this framework to estimate the collective skill of a team. A new dataset based on the Xbox 360 video game, Halo 3, is used for evaluation. The dataset is comprised of online scrimmage and tournament games played between professional Halo 3 teams competing in the Major League Gaming (MLG) Pro Circuit during the 2008 and 2009 seasons. Using the Elo, Glicko, and TrueSkill rating systems as "base learners" for our approaches, we predict the outcomes of games based on subsets of the overall dataset in order to investigate their performance given differing game histories and playing environments. We find that Glicko and TrueSkill benefit greatly from our approaches (TeamSkill-AllK-EV in particular), significantly boosting prediction accuracy in close games and improving performance overall, while Elo performs better without them. We also find that the ways in which each rating system handles skill variance largely determines whether or not it will benefit from our techniques. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Analyzing the structure of social networks is of interest in a wide range of disciplines, but such activity is limited by the fact that these data represent sensitive information and can not be published in their raw form. One of the approaches to sanitize network data is to randomly add or remove edges from the graph. Recent studies have quantified the level of anonymity that is obtained by random perturbation by means of a-posteriori belief probabilities and, by conducting experiments on small datasets, arrived at the conclusion that random perturbation can not achieve meaningful levels of anonymity without deteriorating the graph features. We offer a new information-theoretic perspective on this issue. We make an essential distinction between image and preimage anonymity and propose a more accurate quantification, based on entropy, of the anonymity level that is provided by the perturbed network. We explain why the entropy-based quantification, which is global, is more adequate than the previously used local quantification based on a-posteriori belief. We also prove that the anonymity level quantified by means of entropy is always greater than or equal to the one based on a-posteriori belief probabilities. In addition, we introduce and explore the method of random sparsification, which randomly removes edges, without adding new ones. Extensive experimentation on several very large datasets shows that randomization techniques for identity obfuscation are back in the game, as they may achieve meaningful levels of anonymity while still preserving features of the original graph. © 2011 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper extends the previous work in smooth support vector machine (SSVM) from binary to k-class classification based on a single-machine approach and call it multi-class smooth SVM (MSSVM). This study implements MSSVM for a ternary classification problem and labels it as TSSVM. For the case k>3, this study proposes a one-vs.-one-vs.-rest (OOR) scheme that decomposes the problem into k(k-1)/2 ternary classification subproblems based on the assumption of ternary voting games. Thus, the k-class classification problem can be solved via a series of TSSVMs. The numerical experiments in this study compare the classification accuracy for TSSVM/OOR, one-vs.-one, one-vs.-rest schemes on nine UCI datasets. Results show that TSSVM/OOR outperforms the one-vs.-one and one-vs.-rest for all datasets. This study includes further error analyses to emphasize that the prediction confidence of OOR is significantly higher than the one-vs.-one scheme. Due to the nature of OOR design, it can detect the hidden (unknown) class directly. This study includes a "leave-one-class-out" experiment on the pendigits dataset to demonstrate the detection ability of the proposed OOR method for hidden classes. Results show that OOR performs significantly better than one-vs.-one and one-vs.-rest in the hidden-class detection rate. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Landscape scale conservation planning efforts have been in place for the past several decades to maintain biodiversity. Objectives of past efforts have been to identify areas to create reserves based on species diversity, land ownership, and landscape context. Risk analysis has not often been included in these spatial analyses. Datasets such as the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis (SWReGAP) are now available as are processes that allow risk analysis to be viewed in a spatial context in relations to factors that affect habitats over broad scales. We describe a method to include four spatial datasets to provide coarse scale delineation on areas to focus conservation including species numbers, key habitats, land management and factors that influence habitats. We used the SWReGAP management status dataset to identify management categories for long-term intent of management for biodiversity. The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish identified a set of 290 Species of Greatest Conservation Need (SGCN). Species occurrences for these species were associated with hydrologic unit codes from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). Key habitats were identified by using the SWReGAP land cover dataset and NHD derivatives. Factors that influence habitats were identified and scored for 89 land cover types and 23 aquatic habitats identified by the NMDGF. Our final model prioritizes landscapes that are within key habitats, have high numbers of terrestrial and aquatic Species of Greatest Conservation Need taxa, may be potentially altered by multiple effects that influence habitats, and lack long-term legally-binding management plans protecting them from anthropogenic degradation. Similar to other efforts, riparian and aquatic habitats were identified as the most important for conservation. This information may be displayed spatially, allowing land managers and decision makers to understand the ecological context where multiple effects of potential factors may influence some habitats greater than others, and repeat process with CWCS revisions. © 2011 by the authors.},

The data are then aggregated to the team level for the period 1920-2009 in order to test whether teams built on a more even distribution of observed talent perform better than those teams with a mixture of highly able and less able players. The dependent variable used in the regressions is the percentage of games a team wins each season. We find that conditioning on average player ability, dispersion of both batting and pitching talent displays an optimal degree of inequality, in that teams with too high or too low a spread in player ability perform worse than teams with a more balanced distribution of offensive and defensive talent.

abstract={Rough set feature selection (RSFS) can be used to improve classifier performance. RSFS removes redundant attributes whilst keeping important ones that preserve the classification power of the original dataset. The feature subsets selected by RSFS are called reducts. The intersection of all reducts is called core. However, RSFS handles discrete attributes only. To process datasets consisting of real attributes, they are discretized before applying RSFS. Discretization controls core of the discrete dataset.Moreover, core may critically affect the classification performance of reducts.

We analyze the packet size and the inter departure time distributions of a popular first-person shooter game (Left 4 Dead) and a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (World of Warcraft) in order to compare them to the existing scheme. Recent online gaming traffic is erratically distributed, so it is very difficult to analyze. Therefore, our research focuses on a transformation scheme to obtain new smooth patterns from a messy dataset. It extracts relatively heavy-weighted density data and then transforms them into a corresponding dataset domain to obtain a simplified graph. We compare the analytical model histogram, the chi-square statistic, and the quantile-quantile plot of the proposed scheme to an existing scheme. The results show that the proposed scheme demonstrates a good fit in all parts. The chi-square statistic of our scheme for the Left 4 Dead packet size distribution is less than one ninth of the existing one when dealing with erratic traffic. © 2011 ETRI.},

abstract={This paper explores the impacts of essential elements of management on IT application maturity (ITAM). A game theoretical model is established to show that a firm's IT application maturity should match with its essential elements of management. In order to further validate the analytical result, a data set with 137 firms was collected via a survey instrument. Using reliability and factor analysis on the dataset, a four-dimension measurement construct of IT application maturity is proposed together with a three-dimension measurement construct of essential elements of management. Empirical analysis is then conducted to address research questions on the impacts of essential elements of management on IT application maturity. It is found that while a firm's strategic cooperation capability has no significant effect on IT application maturity, its internal coordination capability positively influences all four dimensions of IT application maturity. For the firm's execution capability, although it shows no significant effect on the overall IT application maturity, it does positively affect the technology and man-machine synergy dimensions of IT application maturity. The findings of this study offer practical guidance for organizations to better align their IT application maturity with essential elements of management. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The use of pose and proportion to represent character traits is well established in art and psychology literature. However, there are no golden rules that quantify a generic design template for stylized character figure drawing. Given the wide variety of drawing styles and a large feature dimension space, it is a significant challenge to extract this information automatically from existing cartoon art. This paper outlines a game-inspired methodology for systematically collecting layman perception feedback, given a set of carefully chosen trait labels and character silhouette images. The rated labels were clustered and then mapped to the pose and proportion parameters of characters in the dataset. The trained model can be used to classify new drawings, providing valuable insight to artists who want to experiment with different poses and proportions in the draft stage. The proposed methodology was implemented as follows: (1) Over 200 full-body, front-facing character images were manually annotated to calculate pose and proportion; (2) A simplified silhouette was generated from the annotations to avoid copyright infringements and prevent users from identifying the source of our experimental figures; (3) An online casual role-playing puzzle game was developed to let players choose meaningful tags (role, physicality, and personality) for characters, where tags and silhouettes received equitable exposure; (4) Analysis on the generated data was done both in stereotype label space as well as character shape space; (5) Label filtering and clustering enabled dimension reduction of the large description space, and subsequently, a select set of design features were mapped to these clusters to train a neural network classifier; (6) Bayesian graphs were also mined to allow informed tweaks to the input feature set, in order to push the character toward a different label stereotype class. The mapping between the collected perception and shape data give us quantitative and qualitative insight into character design. It opens up applications for creative reuse of (and deviation from) existing character designs. © Springer-Verlag 2011.},

abstract={From the perspective of game system designers, players' behavior is one of the most important factors they must consider when designing game systems. To gain a fundamental understanding of the game play behavior of online gamers, exploring users' game play time provides a good starting point. This is because the concept of game play time is applicable to all genres of games and it enables us to model the system workload as well as the impact of system and network QoS on users' behavior. It can even help us predict players' loyalty to specific games. In this paper, we present the World of Warcraft Avatar History (WoWAH) dataset, which comprises the records of 91,065 avatars. The data includes the avatars' game play times and a number of attributes, such as their race, profession, current level, and in-game locations, during a 1,107-day period between Jan. 2006 and Jan. 2009. We believe the WOWAH dataset could be used for various creative purposes, now that it is a public asset of the research community.

abstract={By extracting local spatial-temporal features from videos, many recently proposed approaches for action recognition achieve promising performance. The Bag-of-Words (BoW) model is commonly used in the approaches to obtain the video level representations. However, BoW model roughly assigns each feature vector to its closest visual word, therefore inevitably causing nontrivial quantization errors and impairing further improvements on classification rates. To obtain a more accurate and discriminative representation, in this paper, we propose an approach for action recognition by encoding local 3D spatial-temporal gradient features within the sparse coding framework. In so doing, each local spatial-temporal feature is transformed to a linear combination of a few "atoms" in a trained dictionary. In addition, we also investigate the construction of the dictionary under the guidance of transfer learning. We collect a large set of diverse video clips of sport games and movies, from which a set of universal atoms composed of the dictionary are learned by an online learning strategy. We test our approach on KTH dataset and UCF sports dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-art techniques on KTH dataset and achieves the comparable performance on UCF sports dataset. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In the past we used a great deal of computational power and human expertise for storing a rather big dataset of good 9x9 Go games, in order to build an opening book. We improved the algorithm used for generating and storing these games considerably. However, the results were not very robust, as (i) opening books are definitely not transitive, making the non-regression testing extremely difficult, (ii) different time settings lead to opposite conclusions, because a good opening for a game with 10s per move on a single core is quite different from a good opening for a game with 30s per move on a 32-cores machine, and (iii) some very bad moves sometimes still occur. In this paper, we formalize the optimization of an opening book as a matrix game, compute the Nash equilibrium, and conclude that a naturally randomized opening book provides optimal performance (in the sense of Nash equilibria). Moreover, our research showed that from a finite set of opening books, we can choose a distribution on these opening books so that the resultant randomly constructed opening book has a significantly better performance than each of the deterministic opening books. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The workflow in radiology departments has changed dramatically with the transition to digital PACS, especially with the shift from tile mode to stack mode display of volumetric images. With the increasing number of images in routinely captured datasets, the standard user interface devices (UIDs) become inadequate. One basic approach to improve the navigation of the stack mode datasets is to take advantage of alternative UIDs developed for other domains, such as the computer game industry. We evaluated three UIDs both in clinical practice and in a task-based experiment. After using the devices in the daily image interpretation work, the readers reported that both of the tested alternative UIDs were better in terms of ergonomics compared to the standard mouse and that both alternatives were more efficient when reviewing large CT datasets. In the task-based experiment, one of the tested devices was faster than the standard mouse, while the other alternative was not significantly faster. One of the tested alternative devices showed a larger number of traversed images during the task. The results indicate that alternative user interface devices can improve the navigation of stack mode datasets and that radiologists should consider the potential benefits of alternatives to the standard mouse. © 2009 Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine.},

abstract={The focus of this paper is two-fold. First, similarities generated from six semantic models were compared to human ratings of paragraph similarity on two datasets-23 World Entertainment News Network paragraphs and 50 ABC newswire paragraphs. Contrary to findings on smaller textual units such as word associations (Griffiths, Tenenbaum, & Steyvers, 2007), our results suggest that when single paragraphs are compared, simple nonreductive models (word overlap and vector space) can provide better similarity estimates than more complex models (LSA, Topic Model, SpNMF, and CSM). Second, various methods of corpus creation were explored to facilitate the semantic models' similarity estimates. Removing numeric and single characters, and also truncating document length improved performance. Automated construction of smaller Wikipedia-based corpora proved to be very effective, even improving upon the performance of corpora that had been chosen for the domain. Model performance was further improved by augmenting corpora with dataset paragraphs. © 2010 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.},

This creates new opportunities for improving collaboration, particularly by capturing data that can be used to model the nature of the interactions and to present this model to the users in a form that will facilitate improved collaboration. It is timely to establish principles for designing tabletop-based systems in a manner that can facilitate such modelling. These principles should support effective use of data mining tools to create group collaboration models.

abstract={The value-based approach to strategy argues that a firm's ability to capture value depends on the extent of its added value. In this paper, I empirically test the link between added value and value capture using a longitudinal dataset of United Kingdom law firm performance, capabilities, and client relationships. In this setting, competitors relevant for defining a firm's added value are those that share a client with the firm. Further, within a client relationship, value creation, and hence added value, can be decomposed in two parts: product-line capability and client-specific scope economies. I find that added value, measured at the level of each buyer-supplier relationship, is a driver of relationship stability and supplier profitability. This suggests that suppliers with similar capabilities might enjoy different economic returns depending on the composition of their set of relevant competitors. These findings shed light on the conditions under which firms can appropriate returns from their capabilities. They indicate that concepts from cooperative games can be fruitfully applied to empirical studies of firm performance and to the elaboration of insights from the resource-based view of the firm.

abstract={The growing popularity of online Earth visualization tools and geo-realistic games and the availability of high resolution terrain data have motivated a new class of queries to the interests of the GIS and spatial database community: spatial queries (e.g., kNN) over land surface. However, the fundamental challenges that restrict the applicability of these studies to real world applications are the prohibitive time complexity and storage overhead to pre-compute the shortest surface paths. In this paper, for the first time, we propose an approximate solution to address both challenges and allow browsing the shortest surface paths in O(log N + √N) time, where N is the size of the terrain. With this method, the time and space requirements for an exhaustive all-pair pre-computation have been reduced from O(N3) to O(N 1.5) and O(N) respectively. The substantial savings in both time and storage are gained by taking advantage of the fact that the O(N2) surface paths only deviate from approximate straight lines at O(√N) points, termed rough vertices. As a result, we propose a linear time shortest surface path computation algorithm between two arbitrary vertices and a linear size storage structure, which captures all the shortest surface paths between any pair of vertices. We experimentally verified the applicability and scalability of the proposed methods with large real world and synthetic data sets and showed that accuracy higher than 97% can be obtained in most cases. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={A framework, PISA, for conducting dialogues to resolve disputes concerning the correct categorisation of particular cases, is described. Unlike previous systems to conduct such dialogues, which have typically involved only two agents, PISA allows any number of agents to take part, facilitating discussion of cases which permit many possible categorizations. A particular feature of the framework is that the agents argue directly from individual repositories of experiences rather than from a previously engineered knowledge base, as is the usual case, and so the knowledge engineering bottleneck is avoided. Argument from experience is enabled by real time data-mining conducted by individual agents to find reasons to support their viewpoints, and critique the arguments of other parties. Multiparty dialogues raise a number of significant issues, necessitating appropriate design choices. The paper describes how these issues were resolved and implemented in PISA, and illustrates the operation of PISA using an example based on a dataset relating to nursery provision. Finally some experiments comparing PISA with other classifiers are reported. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.},

abstract={Computational DNA motif discovery is one of the major research areas in bioinformatics, which helps to understanding the mechanism of gene regulation. Recently, we have developed a GA-based motif discovery algorithm, named as GAPK, which addresses the use of some identified transcription factor binding sites extracted from orthologs for algorithm development. With our GAPK framework, technical improvements on background filtering, evolutionary computation or model refinement will contribute to achieving better performances. This paper aims to improve the GAPK framework by introducing a new fitness function, termed as relative model mismatch score (RMMS), which characterizes the conservation and rareness properties of DNA motifs simultaneously. Other technical contributions include a rule-based system for filtering background data and a "most one-in-out" (MOIO) strategy for motif model refinement. Comparative studies are carried out using eight benchmark datasets with original GAPK and two GA-based motif discovery algorithms, GAME and GALF-P. The results show that our improved GAPK method favorably outperforms others on the testing datasets. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The Challenge on Context-Aware Movie Recommendation (CAMRa) was conducted as part of a join event on Context-Awareness in Recommender Systems at the 2010 ACM Recommender Systems conference. The challenge focused on three context-aware recommendation tasks: time-based, mood-based, and social recommendation. The participants were provided with anonymized datasets from two real world online movie recommendation communities and competed against each other for obtaining the highest recommendation accuracy for each task. The datasets contained contextual features, such as mood, plot annotation, social network, and comments, normally not available in movie recommendation datasets. Over 40 teams from 20 countries participated in the challenge. Their participation was summarized by 10 papers accepted to the CAMRa workshop. © 2010 ACM.},

For example, if a peer-to-peer (P2P) computational grid system predicts pairwise bandwidth between all nodes in the system, that information could increase overall system performance by finding high-bandwidth nodes to store large scientific input or output datasets. Another possible beneficiary is a P2P online game, which can provide users a seamless gaming experience by selecting a coordinator node that has high-bandwidth connections to the players in a game region. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

Various supervised learning algorithms are trained on a large-scale set of in-game player behavior data, to predict when a player will stop playing the TRU game and, if the player completes the game, how long will it take to do so. Results reveal that linear regression models and other nOnlinear classification techniques perform well on the tasks and that decision tree learning induces small yet well-performing and informative trees. Moderate performance is achieved from the prediction models, which indicates the complexity of predicting player behavior based on a constrained set of gameplay metrics and the noise existent in the dataset examined, a generic problem in large-scale data collection from millions of remote clients. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={We investigate supervised prediction tasks which involve multiple agents over time, in the presence of drifting concepts. The motivation behind choosing the topic is that such tasks arise in many domains which require predicting human actions. An example of such a task is recommender systems, where it is required to predict the future ratings, given features describing items and context along with the previous ratings assigned by the users. In such a system, the relationships among the features and the class values can vary over time. A common challenge to learners in such a setting is that this variation can occur both across time for a given agent, and also across different agents, (i.e. each agent behaves differently). Furthermore, the factors causing this variation are often hidden. We explore probabilistic models suitable for this setting, along with efficient algorithms to learn the model structure. Our experiments use the Netflix Prize dataset1, a real world dataset which shows the presence of time variant concepts. The results show that the approaches we describe are more accurate than alternative approaches, especially when there is a large variation among agents.

abstract={Three approaches to partitional clustering using genetic algorithms (GA) are compared with k-means and the EM algorithm for three real world datasets (Iris, Glass and Vowel). The GA techniques differ in their encoding of the clustering problem using either a class id for each object (GAIE), medoids to assign objects to the class associated with the nearest medoid (GAME), or parameters for multivariate distributions that describe each cluster (GAPE). For the simple Iris dataset, all algorithms except GAIE obtained results with comparable accuracy, but k-means and EM had more runs with inferior results compared to GAME and GAPE. For the more complex Glass dataset, the results for GAME and GAPE were superior compared to k-means, EM and GAIE regarding their accuracy and variance of the results for repeated runs. None of the algorithms was superior for the most complex dataset (Vowel). We conclude that GAs in clustering are a valuable alternative to k-means and EM, but that the choice of the problem representation is crucial.},

abstract={Player classification has recently become a key aspect of game design in areas such as adaptive game systems, player behaviour prediction, player tutoring and non-player character design. Past research has focused on the design of hierarchical, preference-based and probabilistic models aimed at modelling players' behaviour. We propose a meta-classification approach that breaks the clustering of gameplay mixed data into three levels of analysis. The first level uses dimensionality reduction and partitional clustering of aggregate game data in an action/skill-based classification. The second level applies similarity-based clustering of action sequences to group players according to their preferences. For this we propose a new approach which uses Rubner's Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) as a similarity metric to compare histograms of players' game world explorations. The third level applies a combination of social network analysis metrics, such as shortest path length, to social data to find clusters in the players' social network. We test our approach in a gameplay dataset from a freely available first-person social hunting game.},

abstract={In several concept attainment systems, ranging from recommendation systems to information filtering, a sliding window of learning instances has been used in the learning process to allow the learner to follow concepts that change over time. However, no analytic study has been performed on the relation between the size of the sliding window and the performance of a learning system. In this work, we present such an analytic model that describes the effect of the sliding window size on the prediction performance of a learning system based on iterative feedback. Using a signal-to-noise approach to model the learning ability of the underlying machine learning algorithms, we can provide good estimates of the average performance of a modeling system independently of the supervised machine learning algorithm employed. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology with detailed experiments using synthetic and real datasets, and a variety of learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor and Decision Trees. The results validate the analysis and indicate very good estimation performance in different settings. © 2010 IEEE.},

To investigate whether human associations can be simulated with Linked Data, two preliminary problems are identified: (i) A reasonable ground truth for human associations is lacking and (ii) human associations have different strengths while Linked Data treats all triples equally and does not provide edge weights. To overcome these problems, two ideas for web games in accordance with Luis von Ahn's Games with a Purpose are proposed trying to turn the tedious acquisition processes into fun games. The resulting datasets are then to be used for quantitative comparisons of human associations and Linked Data.},

Based on the assumption that the ball is the point of focus of the game and that the motion flow of the players is dependent on its position during attack actions, the most probable candidates for the ball location are extracted from each frame. These candidates are then validated over time using a Kalman filter.

abstract={Subspace clusters represent useful information in high-dimensional data. However, mining significant subspace clusters in continuous-valued 3D data such as stock-financial ratio-year data, or gene-sample-time data, is difficult. Firstly, typical metrics either find subspaces with very few objects, or they find too many insignificant subspaces - those which exist by chance. Besides, typical 3D subspace clustering approaches abound with parameters, which are usually set under biased assumptions, making the mining process a 'guessing game'. We address these concerns by proposing an information theoretic measure, which allows us to identify 3D subspace clusters that stand out from the data. We also develop a highly effective, efficient and parameter-robust algorithm, which is a hybrid of information theoretical and statistical techniques, to mine these clusters. From extensive experimentations, we show that our approach can discover significant 3D subspace clusters embedded in 110 synthetic datasets of varying conditions. We also perform a case study on real-world stock datasets, which shows that our clusters can generate higher profits compared to those mined by other approaches. © 2010 IEEE.},

Simulations can then be used to determine the impact of shutting down resale markets.},

abstract={Touchscreen-enabled devices are proliferating in the communications and entertainment markets. In this scenario, the use of graphical passwords for user validation is receiving an increasing interest in the last years. Unlike in other fields of research on automatic user authentication, such as biometrics, there are no public databases of graphical passwords usable for research purposes (to the extent of our knowledge). In the present work, the recently captured DooDB database is introduced. This database comprises two subcorpora: doodles and simplified signatures (pseudo-signatures). These data were produced by 100 users, who were asked to draw with their fingertips over a mobile device touchscreen. Forgeries are also included in the database. A quantitative analysis of both datasets is first performed. Preliminary verification experiments using the two kinds of graphical passwords are reported. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Given a collection of Boolean spatio-temporal(ST) event types, the cascading spatio-temporal pattern (CSTP) discovery process finds partially ordered subsets of event-types whose instances are located together and occur in stages. For example, analysis of crime datasets may reveal frequent occurrence of misdemeanors and drunk driving after bar closings on weekends and after large gatherings such as football games. Discovering CSTPs from ST datasets is important for application domains such as public safety (e.g. crime at-tractors and generators) and natural disaster planning(e.g. hurricanes). However, CSTP discovery is challenging for several reasons, including both the lack of computationally efficient, statistically meaningful metrics to quantify interestingness, and the large cardinality of candidate pattern sets that are exponential in the number of event types. Existing literature for ST data mining focuses on mining totally ordered sequences or unordered subsets. In contrast, this paper models CSTPs as partially ordered subsets of Boolean ST event types. We propose a new CSTP interest measure (the Cascade Participation Index) that is computationally cheap(O(n2) vs. exponential, where n is the dataset size) as well as statistically meaningful. We propose a novel algorithm exploiting the ST nature of datasets and evaluate filtering strategies to quickly prune uninteresting candidates. We present a case study to find CSTPs from real crime reports and provide a statistical explanation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed multiresolution spatio-temporal(MST) filtering strategy leads to significant savings in computational costs. Copyright © by SIAM.},

abstract={Research on social networks has advanced significantly due to wide variety of on-line social websites and very popular Web 2.0 application. Social network analysis views social relationships in terms of network and graph theory about nodes (individual actors within the network) and ties (relationships between the actors). Using web mining techniques and social networks analysis it is possible to process and analyze large amount of social data (such as blogtagging, online game playing, instant messenger etc.) and by this to discover valuable information from data. In this way, we can understand the social structure, social relationships and social behaviors. This new approach is also denoted as social network mining. These algorithms differ from established set of data mining algorithms developed to analyze individual records, because social network datasets are called relational due to centrality of relations among entities. This chapter also sets out a process to apply web mining. © 2011, IGI Global.},

Users can navigate a virtual (game) world or an (empirical) dataset while having their hands free to issue other commands. A new low-cost balance interface, the Nintendo balance board, offers widespread use of this form of input. We performed two experiments that explore the fun and efficiency of this interface for navigating simple virtual worlds. Our first study showed that the users completed 2D navigation tasks slower with the balance input method. The second study showed that a standard self-centreing joystick outperforms balance-based interfaces. However, the users in both studies enjoyed the balance input methods despite it being less efficient. The board interfaces performed similarly for easier navigation tasks; leaving the hands free for manipulation tasks while coarse navigation can be performed by the shifting body mass.

abstract={The massively parallel computing using graphical processing unit (GPU), which based on tens of thousands of parallel threats within hundreds of GPU's streaming processors, has gained broad popularity and attracted researchers in a wide range of application areas from finance, computer aided engineering, computational fluid dynamics, game physics, numerics, science, medical imaging, life science, and so on, including molecular biology and bioinformatics. Meanwhile, Markov clustering algorithm (MCL) has become one of the most effective and highly cited methods to detect and analyze the communities/clusters within an interaction network dataset on many real world problems such us social, technological, or biological networks including protein-protein interaction networks. However, as the dataset become bigger and bigger, the computation time of MCL algorithm become slower and slower. Hence, GPU computing is an interesting and challenging alternative to attempt to improve the MCL performance. In this poster paper we introduce our improvement of MCL performance based on ELLPACK-R sparse dataset format using GPU computing with the Compute Unified Device Architecture tool (CUDA) from NVIDIA (called CUDA-MCL). As the results show the significant improvement in CUDA-MCL performance and with the low-cost and widely available GPU devices in the market today, this CUDA-MCL implementation is allowing large-scale parallel computation on off-the-shelf desktop machines. Moreover the GPU computing approaches potentially may contribute to significantly change the way bioinformaticians and biologists compute and interact with their data. © 2010 IEEE.},

There is a huge collection of data from the hi-tech communication equipments associated with moving objects. To find the frequent patterns existing in this data and derive knowledge out of it is of great concern. Frequently occurring paths of flying object trajectories are data dependent and cannot be derived before they are known. In this paper such trajectories are obtained by a novel approach of variable block box counting method. In this approach, variable block boxes are created using spacial coordinates. The number of spacial coordinates in each box and its neighboring boxes determines the frequently occurring trajectories. This path is established by applying the data mining concepts and by using a new kind of relationship from the spacial Euclidean coordinate dataset. Also this may be applied to interesting game domains to find the frequent trajectories of balls shot by players in games. ©2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Handheld devices like mobile phones have very restricted memory and computation environment. Softwares for Face recognition, Speech recognition, Handwriting recognition etc which are developed for mobile phones need to occupy very less space and should do recognition in real-time. We design a sparse classifier which aids these applications by storing very few vectors, recognizing real-time and still generalizing well. Our Sparse Classifier learns a function that is a weighted sum of basis functions, by sequentially appending functions to an initially empty basis, so that the learnt function minimizes the norm of squared loss to approximate a target function. Selection of a smaller set of basis functions from a dictionary of functions is based on Shapley value, which is a well known solution concept from game theory. The basis functions are selected based on the importance in approximating the decision boundary. We show how our sparse classification model built on kernel-based solutions effectively controls the sparsity of the solution. Experimental comparison with SVMs demonstrate that the proposed model shows comparable accuracy in benchmark datasets with very few basis functions resulting in more than 80% reduction in the number of stored vectors.},

Given that the cost for the AP is determined by the peak-hour traffic (e.g. through the 95th-percentile), the individual user contribution towards the aggregate cost is not a linear function of its byte usage. In this paper we propose a metric for evaluating the contribution each individual user has on the peak demand, that is based on Shapley value, a well known game-theoretic concept. Given the computational complexity of calculating the Shapley value, we use a Monte Carlo method for approximating it with reasonable accuracy. We employ our methodology to study a dataset that logs per-subscriber temporal usage patterns over one month period for 10K broadband subscribers of a European AP and report observed results.

abstract={The Web of Data is increasingly becoming an important infrastructure for such diverse sectors as entertainment, government, e-commerce and science. As a result, the robustness of this Web of Data is now crucial. Prior studies show that the Web of Data is strongly dependent on a small number of central hubs, making it highly vulnerable to single points of failure. In this paper, we present concepts and algorithms to analyse and repair the brittleness of the Web of Data. We apply these on a substantial subset of it, the 2010 Billion Triple Challenge dataset. We first distinguish the physical structure of the Web of Data from its semantic structure. For both of these structures, we then calculate their robustness, taking betweenness centrality as a robustness-measure. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such robustness-indicators have been calculated for the Web of Data. Finally, we determine which links should be added to the Web of Data in order to improve its robustness most effectively. We are able to determine such links by interpreting the question as a very large optimisation problem and deploying an evolutionary algorithm to solve this problem. We believe that with this work, we offer an effective method to analyse and improve the most important structure that the Semantic Web community has constructed to date. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={The use of pose and proportion to represent character traits is well established in art and psychology literature. However, there are no Golden Rules that quantify a generic design template for stylized character figure drawing. Given the wide variety of drawing styles and a large feature dimension space, it is a significant challenge to extract this information automatically from existing cartoon art. This paper outlines a game-inspired methodology for systematically collecting layman perception feedback, given a set of carefully chosen trait labels and character silhouette images. The rated labels were clustered and then mapped to the pose and proportion parameters of characters in the dataset. The trained model can be used to classify new drawings, providing valuable insight to artists who want to experiment with different poses and proportions in the draft stage. The proposed methodology was implemented as follows: 1) Over 200 full-body, front-facing character images were manually annotated to calculate pose and proportion; 2) A simplified silhouette was generated from the annotations to avoid copyright infringements and prevent users from identifying the source of our experimental figures; 3) An online casual roleplaying puzzle game was developed to let players choose meaningful tags (role, physicality and personality) for characters, where tags and silhouettes received equitable exposure; 4) Analysis on the generated data was done both in stereotype label space as well as character shape space; 5) Label filtering and clustering enabled dimension reduction of the large description space, and subsequently, a select set of design features were mapped to these clusters to train a neural network classifier. The mapping between the collected perception and shape data give us quantitative and qualitative insight into character design. It opens up applications for creative reuse of (and deviation from) existing character designs. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={Managing vast datasets collected throughout multiple clinical imaging communities has become critical with the ever increasing and diverse nature of datasets. Development of data management infrastructure is further complicated by technical and experimental advances that drive modifications to existing protocols and acquisition of new types of research data to be incorporated into existing data management systems. In this paper, an extensible data management system for clinical neuroimaging studies is introduced: The Human Clinical Imaging Database (HID) and Toolkit. The database schema is constructed to support the storage of new data types without changes to the underlying schema. The complex infrastructure allows management of experiment data, such as image protocol and behavioral task parameters, as well as subject-specific data, including demographics, clinical assessments, and behavioral task performance metrics. Of significant interest, embedded clinical data entry and management tools enhance both consistency of data reporting and automatic entry of data into the database. The Clinical Assessment Layout Manager (CALM) allows users to create on-line data entry forms for use within and across sites, through which data is pulled into the underlying database via the generic clinical assessment management engine (GAME). Importantly, the system is designed to operate in a distributed environment, serving both human users and client applications in a service-oriented manner. Querying capabilities use a built-in multi-database parallel query builder/result combiner, allowing web-accessible queries within and across multiple federated databases. The system along with its documentation is open-source and available from the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resource Clearinghouse (NITRC) site. © 2010 The Author(s).},

abstract={These days web users searching for opinions expressed by others on a particular product or service PS can turn to review repositories, such as Epinions.com or Imdb.com. While these repositories often provide a high quantity of reviews on PS, browsing through archived reviews to locate different opinions expressed on PS is a time-consuming and tedious task, and in most cases, a very labor-intensive process. To simplify the task of identifying reviews expressing positive, negative, and neutral opinions on PS, we introduce a simple, yet effective sentiment classifier, denoted SentiClass, which categorizes reviews on PS using the semantic, syntactic, and sentiment content of the reviews. To speed up the classification process, SentiClass summarizes each review to be classified using eSummar, a single-document, extractive, sentiment summarizer proposed in this paper, based on various sentence scores and anaphora resolution. SentiClass (eSummar, respectively) is domain and structure independent and does not require any training for performing the classification (summarization, respectively) task. Empirical studies conducted on two widely-used datasets, Movie Reviews and Game Reviews, in addition to a collection of Epinions.com reviews, show that SentiClass (i) is highly accurate in classifying summarized or full reviews and (ii) outperforms well-known classifiers in categorizing reviews. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Many computer protection tools incorporate learning techniques that build mathematical models to capture the characteristics of system's activity and then check whether live system's activity fits the learned models. This approach, referred to as anomaly detection, has enjoyed immense popularity because of its effectiveness at recognizing unknown attacks (under the assumption that attacks cause glitches in the protected system). Typically, instead of building a single complex model, smaller, partial models are constructed, each capturing different features of the monitored activity. Such multimodel paradigm raises the non-trivial issue of combining each partial model to decide whether or not the activity contains signs of attacks. Various mechanisms can be chosen, ranging from a simple weighted average to Bayesian networks, or more sophisticated strategies. In this paper we show how different aggregation functions can influence the detection accuracy. To mitigate these issues we propose a radically different approach: rather than treating the aggregation as a calculation, we formulate it as a decision problem, implemented through cooperative negotiation between autonomous agents. We validated the approach on a publicly available, realistic dataset, and show that it enhances the detection accuracy with respect to a system that uses elementary aggregation mechanisms. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Recent pandemics such as Swine Flu have caused concern for public health officials. Given the ever increasing pace at which infectious diseases can spread globally, officials must be prepared to react sooner and with greater epidemic intelligence gathering capabilities. However, state-of-the-art systems for Epidemic Intelligence have not kept the pace with the growing need for more robust public health event detection. In this paper, we propose a game-changing approach where public health events are detected in an unsupervised manner. We address the problems associated with adapting an unsupervised learner to the medical domain and in doing so, propose an approach which combines aspects from different feature-based event detection methods. We evaluate our approach with a real world dataset with respect to the quality of article clusters. Our results show that we are able to achieve a precision of 66% and a recall of 81% when evaluated using manually annotated, real-world data. This shows promising results for the use of such techniques in this new problem setting. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Auditory virtual environments are becoming increasingly relevant for applications such as teleconferencing, hearing aids, video games, and general immersive listening. To enable high fidelity renderings of the sound scene in such environments, the audio content must be treated with the actual listener's acoustical filters, the so-called head-related transfer functions (HRTFs). The current challenge for general public applications, given the difficulty of measuring HRTFs for a given listener, is to be able to individually generate HRTFs or perform a selection from a database of pre-existing HRTFs, so as to provide the listener an HRTF that enables a listening experience that is as realistic as possible, using for example only data taken from a photo of the listener's ear. A process is described in which a data- base of 46 measured HRTFs was analysed using various data reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and frequency scaling. A selection of the subjects' most significant morphological parameters was performed using data mining techniques such as support vector machines. This subset of morphological parameters for subjects associated to the HRTF database were then used to perform multiple linear regressions against the reduced dataset of HRTFs in order to predict what might be the listener's preferred HRTFs. The prediction performance was then compared to the results of a perceptual evaluation of the HRTFs from the database using a listening test. The results show that the proposed process was able to predict preferred HRTFs for a listener significantly better than if the HRTFs were chosen at random. The results from the listening test were also used to explore a perceptually relevant frequency range of the HRTF. Copyright © (2010) by the International Congress on Acoustics.},

abstract={The model of Open Innovation is the best choice to the firms that can not afford research and development (R&D) costs but intent continues playing the innovation game. This model offers to any firm the companies spread worldwide and in all research fields as possible partners in R&D. However, the possible partnership can not be restricted in the manager's know-who. The patent documents can be the source of rich information about technical development and innovation from a huge amount of firms. Search through all these documents created daily is a cumbersome task that technology managers can not afford. This paper aims to introduce an automated model to seek for matching between firms' R&D using Data Mining techniques applied into patents documents datasets. The methodology considers the search for patents documents from possible partners and these data treatment through Association technique between IPC fields in the patents.

abstract={The automatic detection of meaningful phases in a soccer game depends on the accurate localization of players and the ball at each moment. However, the automatic analysis of soccer sequences is a challenging task due to the presence of fast moving multiple objects. For this purpose, we present a multi-camera analysis system that yields the position of the ball and players on a common ground plane. The detection in each camera is based on a code-book algorithm and different features are used to classify the detected blobs. The detection results of each camera are transformed using homography to a virtual top-view of the playing field. Within this virtual top-view we merge trajectory information of the different cameras allowing to refine the found positions. In this paper, we evaluate the system on a public SOCCER dataset and end with a discussion of possible improvements of the dataset. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={We present an interactive, hybrid human-computer method for object classification. The method applies to classes of objects that are recognizable by people with appropriate expertise (e.g., animal species or airplane model), but not (in general) by people without such expertise. It can be seen as a visual version of the 20 questions game, where questions based on simple visual attributes are posed interactively. The goal is to identify the true class while minimizing the number of questions asked, using the visual content of the image. We introduce a general framework for incorporating almost any off-the-shelf multi-class object recognition algorithm into the visual 20 questions game, and provide methodologies to account for imperfect user responses and unreliable computer vision algorithms. We evaluate our methods on Birds-200, a difficult dataset of 200 tightly-related bird species, and on the Animals With Attributes dataset. Our results demonstrate that incorporating user input drives up recognition accuracy to levels that are good enough for practical applications, while at the same time, computer vision reduces the amount of human interaction required. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Problem statement: Human ping-pong players determine the stroke trajectory according to their experience before the ball enters their court. However, to enable a humanoid robot to select the appropriate stroke motion based on skills learned from 3D motion, important patterns must be generated to simplify the complex 3D motion. Approach: This study developed an effective strategy for teaching ping-pong skills to a humanoid robot. An optical/inertial motion-capture system that retrieves the stroke motion was constructed, along with the retrieved stroke motion trajectories analyzed to obtain the desired stroke patterns of the robot. Results: A motion capture system was implemented mainly to orient the robot on the stroke motion trajectory. This system was applied directly to a ping-pong game between a human player and a pitching machine to enable the robot to learn backhand strokes through human demonstration. The ball was continuously struck to the opponent so that it hit the anticipated region on the opposite side of the court while the pitching machine served the ball. The data were then classified using the proposed stopping detector and then processed by Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to generate the stroke patterns after collecting 50 datasets for stroke trajectories. Conclusion: The right arm of the humanoid robot was successfully instructed to perform the actual ping-pong stroke using the generated trajectory. © 2010 Science Publications.},

It is important to assure that these dentures have a sufficient fit. We introduce a dataset of 13 edentulous patients that have been recorded with and without complete dentures in situ. These patients have been rated an insufficient fit of their dentures, so that additional (sufficient) dentures and additional speech recordings have been prepared. In this paper we show that sufficient dentures increase the performance of an ASR system by ca. 27 %. Based on these results, we present and discuss three different systems that automatically determine whether the dentures of an edentulous person have a sufficient fit or not. The system with the best performance models the recordings by GMMs and uses the mean vectors of these GMMs as features in an SVM. With this system we were able to achieve a recognition rate of 80 %. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel and efficient approach to retrieve human motion capture data as used in data-driven computer games, animated movies and special effects in the aim of finding a specific motion. From the kinematic chain model, the human motion capture data is transformed to a spatial-temporal invariance representation called the motion feature representation, in which each segment of kinematic chain model is represented by an angle between itself and the root segment. We treat the human motion as a cluster of curves of angle. In the aim of finding a human motion capture data in a very large database, we propose a novel lower bounding distance called LB-Keogh-Lowe to speed up similarity search. In order to reduce the computational cost, we employ techniques to simplify the curves length of both the envelopes curves and the query data. The similarity between two human motions is measured by applying the constrained Dynamic Time Warping. We carry out an experimental analysis with various real motion capture dataset. The results demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in the context of the human motion capture data and the potentiality to apply it in others contexts of the time-series data retrieval. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Second, we generalize our results to partially labeled data. To achieve our goal, we use state-of-the-art methods for max-margin learning and online convex programming.

It aims to test: the effect of the Athens 2004 Olympics on the general index of the ASE; the impact of the Olympic Games 2004 to the sponsors' prices traded on the ASE (based on three National sponsors and one International sponsor); and the effect of the Greek Olympic Champions (winners' effect) on the course of the ASE. Design/methodology/approach: This paper captures financial time series characteristics by employing an AR(1)-GARCH(1,1) model with generalized error distribution (GED). The paper uses daily closing prices for the General ASE index and four Grand Sponsors listed in the ASE (Coca-Cola, Alpha Bank, OTE, and Cosmote) over the period 19 January 1996 to 20 December 2005. Findings: The results show no effect on the general ASE index, but a positive effect on the OTE (Hellenic Telecommunications Organisation) index. Also, the results show a positive effect of Greek Medallists on the ASE index and two National sponsors, Alpha Bank and OTE. Research limitations/implications: Further research should investigate the impact of other mega sporting events (Mundial, European Championships) on the course of international stock markets using high-frequency datasets and models. Practical implications: The findings are strongly recommended to financial managers and investors dealing with Greek stock indices. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is to examine the above hypotheses on the relationship between the Athens Olympic Games and the ASE using a large sample data, and a Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model with GED. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

While researchers have investigated the structure of (social) networks for decades, the activity characteristics and the community structure of online social gaming remain relatively unknown. To address this situation, in this work we investigate the BBO Fans club for online bridge. First, we introduce a method to collect and analyze data from BBO Fans and its underlying gaming platform. Our method is novel in that it addresses the lack of a strict definition of social relationship between BBO Fans players, and it defines several player types with implications on community formation and operation. Second, we use the proposed method to collect and analyze a 40-day BBO Fans dataset comprising over 140,000 unique players and over 3,000,000 unique play sessions. T hird, we compare the characteristics of BBO Fans with other large social networking and online gaming applications. We find in particular that BBO Fans generates similar levels of activity as but has different community characteristics than similarly-sized games on FaceBook, the largest social network in the world.},

abstract={As part of Campaigns of Air Quality Research in Beijing and Surrounding Region-2008 (CAREBeijing-2008), an Aerodyne High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was deployed in urban Beijing to characterize submicron aerosol particles during the time of 2008 Beijing Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (24 July to 20 September 2008). The campaign mean PM1 mass concentration was 63.1 &plusmn; 39.8 1/4g mĝ̂'3; the mean composition consisted of organics (37.9%), sulfate (26.7%), ammonium (15.9%), nitrate (15.8%), black carbon (3.1%), and chloride (0.87%). The average size distributions of the species (except BC) were all dominated by an accumulation mode peaking at about 600 nm in vacuum aerodynamic diameter, and organics was characterized by an additional smaller mode extending below 100 nm. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis of the high resolution organic mass spectral dataset differentiated the organic aerosol into four components, i.e., hydrocarbon-like (HOA), cooking-related (COA), and two oxygenated organic aerosols (OOA-1 and OOA-2), which on average accounted for 18.1, 24.4, 33.7 and 23.7% of the total organic mass, respectively. The HOA was identified to be closely associated with primary combustion sources, while the COA mass spectrum and diurnal pattern showed similar characteristics to that measured for cooking emissions. The OOA components correspond to aged secondary organic aerosol. Although the two OOA components have similar elemental (O/C, H/C) compositions, they display differences in mass spectra and time series which appear to correlate with the different source regions sampled during the campaign. Back trajectory clustering analysis indicated that the southerly air flows were associated with the highest PM1 pollution during the campaign. Aerosol particles in southern airmasses were especially rich in inorganic and oxidized organic species. Aerosol particles in northern airmasses contained a large fraction of primary HOA and COA species, probably due to stronger influences from local emissions. The lowest concentration levels for all major species were obtained during the Olympic game days (8 to 24 August 2008), possibly due to the effects of both strict emission controls and favorable meteorological conditions. © Author(s) 2010.},

abstract={Human action understanding and analysis for various applications are still in infancy due to various factors. In this paper, for recognizing various complex activities, a combined cue for motion representation and later recognition is demonstrated based on the optical flowbased four directional motion history and basic energy images. Optical flow between consecutive frames are computed to create the update function and to segment the moving regions. These motion vectors are split into four different channels. From these channels, the corresponding four directional history templates are computed. These along with frame-subtracted energy motion templates represent the final motion information of an action sequence. From these templates, feature vectors are calculated according to the seven Hu invariants. We develop a 35-dimensional feature vector for each action. For classification, k-nearest neighbor classification scheme is employed. For partitioning scheme, we employ leave-one-out cross-validation method. Both indoor and outdoor dataset provide satisfactory recognition results. These analysis, representation can be used for robot vision, interactive systems, computer games, behavior understanding, etc. © 2010 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a novel approach for American Sign Langauge (ASL) phrase verification that combines confidence measures (CM) obtained from aligning forward sign models the conventional approach) to the input data with the CM's obtained from aligning reversed sign models to the same input. To demonstrate our approach we have used two CM's, the Normalized likelihood score and the Log-Likelihood Ratio (LLR).We perform leave-one-signer-out cross validation on a dataset of 420 ASL phrases obtained from five deaf children playing an educational game called CopyCat. The results show that for the new method the alignment selected for signs in a test phrase has a significantly better match to the ground truth when compared to the traditional approach. Additionally, when a low false reject rate is desired the new technique can provide a better verification accuracy as compared to the conventional approach. © 2010 IEEE.},

This paper explores a strategy for harnessing the linguistic abilities of human beings to develop datasets that can be used to train machine learning algorithms for WSD. To create such datasets, we introduce a new interactive system: a fun game designed to produce valuable output by engaging human players in what they perceive to be a cooperative task of guessing the same word as another player. Our system makes a valuable contribution by tackling the knowledge acquisition bottleneck in the WSD problem domain.

Congressional reforms in 1995 created the Members Representational Allowance, providing members with more flexibility in deploying their official resources. However, these reforms also created a zero-sum game where a dollar spent on travel is a dollar not available for sending mass mail or paying staff salaries. Using a newly created dataset, we argue and find evidence that members allocate resources to support their particular representational goals, which change throughout the course of a member's career (Fenno 1973; 1978).

abstract={We present FlashStore, a high throughput persistent keyvalue store, that uses flash memory as a non-volatile cache between RAM and hard disk. FlashStore is designed to store the working set of key-value pairs on flash and use one flash read per key lookup. As the working set changes over time, space is made for the current working set by destaging recently unused key-value pairs to hard disk and recycling pages in the flash store. FlashStore organizes key-value pairs in a log-structure on flash to exploit faster sequential write performance. It uses an in-memory hash table to index them, with hash collisions resolved by a variant of cuckoo hashing. The in-memory hash table stores compact key signatures instead of full keys so as to strike tradeoffs between RAM usage and false flash read operations. FlashStore can be used as a high throughput persistent key-value storage layer for a broad range of server class applications. We compare FlashStore with BerkeleyDB, an embedded key-value store application, running on hard disk and flash separately, so as to bring out the performance gain of FlashStore in not only using flash as a cache above hard disk but also in its use of flash aware algorithms. We use real-world data traces from two data center applications, namely, Xbox LIVE Primetime online multi-player game and inline storage deduplication, to drive and evaluate the design of FlashStore on traditional and low power server platforms. FlashStore outperforms BerkeleyDB by up to 60x on throughput (ops/sec), up to 50x on energy efficiency (ops/Joule), and up to 85x on cost efficiency (ops/sec/dollar) on the evaluated datasets. © 2010 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract={Partial wave analysis is an important tool for determining resonance properties in hadron spectroscopy. For large data samples however, the un-binned likelihood fits employed are computationally very expensive. At the Beijing Spectrometer (BES) III experiment, an increase in statistics compared to earlier experiments of up to two orders of magnitude is expected. In order to allow for a timely analysis of these datasets, additional computing power with short turnover times has to be made available. It turns out that graphics processing units (GPUs) originally developed for 3D computer games have an architecture of massively parallel single instruction multiple data floating point units that is almost ideally suited for the algorithms employed in partial wave analysis. We have implemented a framework for tensor manipulation and partial wave fits called GPUPWA. The user writes a program in pure C++ whilst the GPUPWA classes handle computations on the GPU, memory transfers, caching and other technical details. In conjunction with a recent graphics processor, the framework provides a speed-up of the partial wave fit by more than two orders of magnitude compared to legacy FORTRAN code. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Our approach is called Approximative Generalisation and can compress several data points into one example. In case that the original examples are mixture of positive and negative examples, the resulting example is ascribed in probability values representing proportion of positiveness. Our longer term aim is to apply on large Chess endgame database to allow well controlled evaluations of the technique. In this paper we start by choosing a simple game of Noughts and Crosses and we apply mini-max backup algorithm to obtain database of examples. These outcomes are compacted using our approach and empirical results show this has advantage both in accuracy and speed.

abstract={This paper introduces a model based upon games on an evolving network, and develops three clustering algorithms according to it. In the clustering algorithms, data points for clustering are regarded as players who can make decisions in games. On the network describing relationships among data points, an edge-removing-and-rewiring (ERR) function is employed to explore in a neighborhood of a data point, which removes edges connecting to neighbors with small payoffs, and creates new edges to neighbors with larger payoffs. As such, the connections among data points vary over time. During the evolution of network, some strategies are spread in the network. As a consequence, clusters are formed automatically, in which data points with the same evolutionarily stable strategy are collected as a cluster, so the number of evolutionarily stable strategies indicates the number of clusters. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Purpose: Smartphones facilitate the potential adoption of new mobile applications. The purpose of this research is to study users and non-users of three selected mobile applications, and find out what really drives the intention to use these applications across users and non-users. Design/methodology/approach: The authors measured actual usage of mobile applications in a panel study of 579 Finnish smartphone users, using in-device measurements as an objective way to identify users and non-users. A web-based survey was used in collecting data to test an extended TAM model in explaining intention to use. Findings: Perceived technological barriers negatively affect behavioural control, reflecting people's assessment of themselves being capable of using the services without trouble. Behavioural control is directly linked to perceived usefulness (except for games) and perceived enjoyment, as hypothesized. Perceived enjoyment and usefulness were generically found to explain intention to use applications for both users and for non-users. Research limitations/implications: With regards to the impact of social norms, the study finds that further research needs to be done in exploring its impact more thoroughly. The dataset of the research, consisting purely of male-dominated, young smartphone users, make the generalization of results difficult. Practical implications: There are differences regarding what drives the usage of different kinds of mobile applications. In this study, map applications and mobile Internet, are driven by more utilitarian motivations, whereas games are more hedonic. It is also clear that not everybody are using applications facilitated by smartphones, and therefore the presented approach of studying users and non-users separately provides a new approach to analyze adoption on a practical level. Originality/value: This research proves that models like TAM should not treat mobile services as a generic concept, but instead to specifically address individual mobile services. The research also demonstrates the unique value of combining objective usage measurements (reflecting actual behaviour) with traditional survey data in more comprehensively modelling service adoption. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={The Kalman recursive algorithm has been very widely used for integrating navigation sensor data to achieve optimal system performances. This paper explores the use of the Kalman filter to extend the aggregation of spatial multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) and to find optimal solutions with respect to a decision strategy space where a possible decision rule falls. The approach was tested in a case study in the Clearwater National Forest in central Idaho, using existing landslide datasets from roaded and roadless areas and terrain attributes. In this approach, fuzzy membership functions were used to standardize terrain attributes and develop criteria, while the aggregation of the criteria was achieved by the use of a Kalman filter. The approach presented here offers advantages over the classical MCE theory because the final solution includes both the aggregated solution and the areas of uncertainty expressed in terms of standard deviation. A comparison of this methodology with similar approaches suggested that this approach is promising for predicting landslide susceptibility and further application as a spatial decision support system. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We present a system for generating infinite images from large collections of photos by means of transformed image retrieval. Given a query image, we first transform it to simulate how it would look if the camera moved sideways and then perform image retrieval based on the transformed image. We then blend the query and retrieved images to create a larger panorama. Repeating this process will produce an infinite image. The transformed image retrieval model is not limited to simple 2-D left/right image translation, however, and we show how to approximate other camera motions like rotation and forward motion/zoom-in using simple 2-D image transforms. We represent images in the database as a graph where each node is an image and different types of edges correspond to different types of geometric transformations simulating different camera motions. Generating infinite images is thus reduced to following paths in the image graph. Given this data structure we can also generate a panorama that connects two query images, simply by finding the shortest path between the two in the image graph. We call this option the image taxi. Our approach does not assume photographs are of a single real 3-D location, nor that they were taken at the same time. Instead, we organize the photos in themes, such as city streets or skylines and synthesize new virtual scenes by combining images from distinct but visually similar locations. There are a number of potential applications to this technology. It can be used to generate long panoramas as well as content aware transitions between reference images or video shots. Finally, the image graph allows users to interactively explore large photo collections for ideation, games, social interaction, and artistic purposes. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={Recently, some mainstream e-commerce web sites have begun using "pay-per-bid" auctions to sell items, from video games to bars of gold. In these auctions bidders incur a cost for placing each bid in addition to (or sometimes in lieu of) the winner's final purchase cost. Thus even when a winner's purchase cost is a small fraction of the item's intrinsic value, the auctioneer can still profit handsomely from the bid fees. Our work provides novel analyses for these auctions, based on both modeling and datasets derived from auctions at Swoopo.com, the leading pay-per-bid auction site. While previous modeling work predicts profit-free equilibria, we analyze the impact of information asymmetry broadly, as well as Swoopo features such as bidpacks and the Swoop It Now option specifically. We find that even small asymmetries across players (cheaper bids, better estimates of other players' intent, different valuations of items, committed players willing to play "chicken") can increase the auction duration significantly and thus skew the auctioneer's profif disproportionately. We discuss our findings in the context of a dataset of thousands of live auctions we observed on Swoopo, which enables us also to examine behavioral factors, such as the power of aggressive bidding. Ultimately, our findings show that even with fully rational players, if players overlook or are unaware any of these factors, the result is outsized profits for pay-per-bid auctioneers. © 2010 ACM.},

abstract={Telecommunication applications based on user modeling focus on extracting customer behavior and preferences from the information implicitly included in Call Detail Record (CDR) datasets. Even though there are many different application areas (fraud detection, viral and targeted marketing, churn prediction, etc.) they all share a common data source (CDRs) and a common set of features for modeling the user. In this paper we present our experience with different applications areas in generating user models from massive real datasets of both mobile phone and landline subscriber activity. We present the analysis of a dataset containing the traces of 50,000 mobile phone users and 50,000 landline users from the same geographical area for a period of six months and compare the different behaviors when using landlines and mobile phones and the implications that such differences have for each application. Our results indicate that user models for a variety of applications can be generated efficiently and in a homogeneous way using an architecture based on distributed computing and that there are numerous differences between mobile phone and landline users that have relevant practical implications. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={How can we maintain a dynamic profile capturing a user's reading interest against the common interest? What are the queries that have been asked 1,000 times more frequently to a search engine from users in Asia than in North America? What are the keywords (or tags) that are 1,000 times more frequent in the blog stream on computer games than in the blog stream on Hollywood movies? To answer such interesting questions, we need to find discriminative items in multiple data streams. Each data source, such as Web search queries in a region and blog postings on a topic, can be modeled as a data stream due to the fast growing volume of the source. Motivated by the extensive applications, in this paper, we study the problem of mining discriminative items in multiple data streams. We show that, to exactly find all discriminative items in stream S 1 against stream S 2 by one scan, the space lower bound is, where Σ is the alphabet of items and n 1 is the current size of S 1. To tackle the space challenge, we develop three heuristic algorithms that can achieve high precision and recall using sub-linear space and sub-linear processing time per item with respect to {pipe}Σ{pipe}. The complexity of all algorithms are independent to the size of the two streams. An extensive empirical study using both real data sets and synthetic data sets verifies our design. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Combining a standard game theoretic model of crisis bargaining with a unique dataset on courts, executives, and legislatures for 18 Latin American countries between 1985 and 2008, the article develops a strategic account of how interbranch crises emerge and evolve. In addition to providing the first systematic picture of the frequency, type, and location of interbranch crises for the region, the article demonstrates that the decision to initiate an interbranch crisis is influenced by the allocation of institutional powers, public support for the targeted branch, and the expectations of success based on recent experiences.

As this improved bandit formula does not solve several important situations (semeais, nakade) in computer Go, we present three other important improvements which are central in the recent progress of our program MoGo. We show an expert-based improvement of Monte-Carlo simulations for nakade situations; we also emphasize some limitations of this modification. We show a technique which preserves diversity in the Monte-Carlo simulation, which greatly improves the results in 19x19. Whereas the UCB-based exploration term is not efficient in MoGo, we show a new exploration term which is highly efficient in MoGo.

abstract={Explore cutting-edge statistical methodologies for collecting, analyzing, and modeling online auction data Online auctions are an increasingly important marketplace, as the new mechanisms and formats underlying these auctions have enabled the capturing and recording of large amounts of bidding data that are used to make important business decisions. As a result, new statistical ideas and innovation are needed to understand bidders, sellers, and prices. Combining methodologies from the fields of statistics, data mining, information systems, and economics, Modeling Online Auctions introduces a new approach to identifying obstacles and asking new questions using online auction data. The authors draw upon their extensive experience to introduce the latest methods for extracting new knowledge from online auction data. Rather than approach the topic from the traditional game-theoretic perspective, the book treats the online auction mechanism as a data generator, outlining methods to collect, explore, model, and forecast data. Topics covered include: • Data collection methods for online auctions and related issues that arise in drawing data samples from a Web site • Models for bidder and bid arrivals, treating the different approaches for exploring bidder-seller networks • Data exploration, such as integration of time series and cross-sectional information; curve clustering; semi-continuous data structures; and data hierarchies • The use of functional regression as well as functional differential equation models, spatial models, and stochastic models for capturing relationships in auction data • Specialized methods and models for forecasting auction prices and their applications in automated bidding decision rule systems Throughout the book, R and MATLAB software are used for illustrating the discussed techniques. In addition, a related Web site features many of the book's datasets and R and MATLAB code that allow readers to replicate the analyses and learn new methods to apply to their own research. Modeling Online Auctions is a valuable book for graduate-level courses on data mining and applied regression analysis. It is also a one-of-a-kind reference for researchers in the fields of statistics, information systems, business, and marketing who work with electronic data and are looking for new approaches for understanding online auctions and processes. © 2010 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

We investigate aggregate usage of the search engine, such as number of users, queries, and terms. We also investigate the structure of queries and terms submitted by these users. The results are compared to Web searching on traditional search engines. Results show that 60% of the traffic comes from the engine's application program interface, indicating that real time search is heavily leveraged by other applications. Of the queries, 30% were unique (used only once in the entire dataset). The most frequent query accounted for 0.003% of the query set. Less than 8% of the terms were unique. The most frequently used terms accounted for only 0.03% of the total terms. Concerning search topics, the most used terms dealt with technology, entertainment, and politics, reflecting both the temporal nature of the queries and, perhaps, an early adopter user-based. Sexual queries were quite low, relative to traditional Web search. Searchers of real time content often repeat queries overtime, perhaps indicating long term interest in a topic. We discuss the implications for search engines and information providers as real time content increasingly enters the main stream. © 2010 Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).},

abstract={Over the last decades, native Amazonians have put increasing pressure on animal wildlife owing to growth in demand. Across societies, household monetary income and wealth shape food consumption; hence, so it is natural to ask what effect might these variables have on the demand for wildlife consumption among native Amazonians, particularly as they gain a stronger foothold in the market economy and increasing de jure stewardship over their territories. Prior estimates of the effects of household monetary income and household wealth on wildlife consumption among native Amazonians have relied on cross-sectional data and produced unclear results. The goal of this research was to improve the precision of previous estimates by drawing on a larger sample and on longitudinal data. The analysis draws on a dataset composed of five consecutive annual surveys (2002-2006, inclusive) from 324 households in a native Amazonian society of foragers and farmers in Bolivia (Tsimane'). Multiple regression analysis is used to estimate the association between wildlife consumption and monetary income and wealth. Wildlife consumption bore a positive association with the level of household wealth and no significant association with household monetary income. Among Tsimane', the main internal threat to wildlife conservation in the short run will likely arise from increases in wealth, probably from the enhanced capacity that selected physical assets (e.g. guns) have in the capture of animal wildlife. © 2009 The Authors.

abstract={The rapid growth of photo sharing websites has resulted in some new problems around the management of a large (and quickly increasing) number of photographers with different needs and usage characteristics. Despite significant advances in the field of computer vision, little has been done to leverage these technologies for photographer understanding and management, partly due to the high computational cost of extracting application-specific image features. Recently robust multi-view face detection technologies have been widely adopted by many photo sharing sites. This affords a limited but "standard" pre-computed set of face features to tackle these administrative problems in large scale settings. In this paper we present a principled statistical model to alleviate one such administrative task - the automatic analysis of photographer competency given only face detection results on a set of their photos. The model uses summary statistics to estimate the probability a given individual belongs to a population of high competence photographers over against a second population of lower competence photographers. Using this model, we have achieved high classification accuracy (respectively 84.3% and 90.9%) on two large image datasets. We discuss an application of this approach to assist in managing a photo-sharing website. © 2010 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.},

Psychologists have shown that the human visual system is particularly efficient and effective in perceiving high-level meanings in cluttered real-world scenes, such as objects, scene classes, activities and the stories in the images. In this chapter, we discuss a generativemodel approach for classifying complex human activities (such as croquet game, snowboarding, etc.) given a single static image.We observe that object recognition in the scene as well as scene environment classification of the image facilitate each other in the overall activity recognition task. We formulate this observation in a graphical model representation where activity classification is achieved by combining information from both the object recognition and the scene classification pathways. For evaluating the robustness of our algorithm, we have assembled a challenging dataset consisting real-world images of eight different sport events, most of them collected from the Internet.

abstract={Data and object clustering techniques are used in a wide variety of scientific applications such as biology, pattern recognition, information systems, etc. Traditionally, clustering methods have focused on optimizing a single metric, however, several multidisciplinary applications such as robot team deployment, ad hoc networks, facility location, etc., require the simultaneous examination of multiple metrics during clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for spatial data clustering based on the concepts of microeconomic theory, which can simultaneously optimize both the compaction and the equipartitioning objectives. The algorithm models a multistep, normal form game consisting of randomly initialized clusters as players that compete for the allocation of data objects from resource locations. A Nash-equilibrium-based methodology is used to derive solutions that are socially fair for all the players. After each step, the clusters are updated using the KMeans algorithm, and the process is repeated until the stopping criteria are satisfied. Extensive simulations were performed on several real data sets as well as artificially synthesized data sets to evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm yields significantly better results as compared to the traditional algorithms. Further, the proposed algorithm yields a high value of fairness, a metric that indicates the quality of the solution in terms of simultaneous optimization of the objectives. Also, the sensitivity of the various design parameters on the performance of our algorithm is analyzed and reported. © 2010 IEEE.},

I argue that pacts are part of an electoral strategy for political parties. They are one way a party can convince voters that economic outcomes under its rule will be better than those under a challenger. I show that pacts can emerge as part of equilibrium behavior in a repeated game but only if the policymaker is sufficiently willing to work with unions. There is no reason for a pact to exist in the absence of electoral incentives. I hypothesize that pacts are more likely to be struck nearer to elections and with greater Left participation in government. Using an original dataset on social pacts in the OECD, 1974-2000, I find evidence that the onset of pacts is related to elections, partisanship, and EMU convergence pressures. © 2010 Southern Political Science Association.},

abstract={This study describes fish assemblages and their spatial patterns off the coast of California from Point Arena to Point Sal, by combining the results of the multivariate analyses of several fisheries datasets with a geographic information system. In order to provide comprehensive spatial coverage for the areas of inshore, continental shelf, and continental slope, three fisheries datasets were analyzed: 1) Inshore: the California Department of Fish and Game dataset of fishery-dependent commercial passenger fishing vessel trips that targeted rockfish; 2) Continental Shelf: the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) fishery-independent bottom trawls; and 3) Continental Slope: the NMFS fishery-independent bottom trawls on the continental slope. One-hundred seven species were analyzed. These species represented those captured in at least 5% of the fishing trips or trawls in at least one of the three data sets. We analyzed each of the three datasets separately, and the three sets of results were combined to define 28 species assemblages and 23 site groups. A species assemblage consisted of species caught together, whereas a site group consisted of fishing trips or trawl locations that tended to have the same species assemblages. At the scale of these datasets, 97% of all site groups were significantly segregated by depth.},

abstract={To enable high-performance computing (HPC) for applications with large datasets using a Sony® PLAYSTATION® 3 (PS3™) video game console, we configured a hybrid system consisting of a Windows® PC and a PS3™. To validate this system, we implemented the real-time multiplet identifier (RTMI) application, which identifies multiplets of microearthquakes in terms of the similarity of their waveforms. The cross-correlation computation, which is a core algorithm of the RTMI application, was optimised for the PS3™ platform, while the rest of the computation, including data input and output remained on the PC. With this configuration, the core part of the algorithm ran 69 times faster than the original program, accelerating total computation speed more than five times. As a result, the system processed up to 2100 total microseismic events, whereas the original implementation had a limit of 400 events. These results indicate that this system enables high-performance computing for large datasets using the PS3™, as long as data transfer time is negligible compared with computation time. © 2010 ASEG/SEGJ/KSEG.},

abstract={Background: Prediction of protein structural classes (α, β, α + β and α/β) from amino acid sequences is of great importance, as it is beneficial to study protein function, regulation and interactions. Many methods have been developed for high-homology protein sequences, and the prediction accuracies can achieve up to 90%. However, for low-homology sequences whose average pairwise sequence identity lies between 20% and 40%, they perform relatively poorly, yielding the prediction accuracy often below 60%.Results: We propose a new method to predict protein structural classes on the basis of features extracted from the predicted secondary structures of proteins rather than directly from their amino acid sequences. It first uses PSIPRED to predict the secondary structure for each protein sequence. Then, the chaos game representation is employed to represent the predicted secondary structure as two time series, from which we generate a comprehensive set of 24 features using recurrence quantification analysis, K-string based information entropy and segment-based analysis. The resulting feature vectors are finally fed into a simple yet powerful Fisher's discriminant algorithm for the prediction of protein structural classes. We tested the proposed method on three benchmark datasets in low homology and achieved the overall prediction accuracies of 82.9%, 83.1% and 81.3%, respectively. Comparisons with ten existing methods showed that our method consistently performs better for all the tested datasets and the overall accuracy improvements range from 2.3% to 27.5%. A web server that implements the proposed method is freely available at http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~chenxin/RKS_PPSC/.Conclusion: The high prediction accuracy achieved by our proposed method is attributed to the design of a comprehensive feature set on the predicted secondary structure sequences, which is capable of characterizing the sequence order information, local interactions of the secondary structural elements, and spacial arrangements of α helices and β strands. Thus, it is a valuable method to predict protein structural classes particularly for low-homology amino acid sequences. © 2010 Yang et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={Motivation: Epistasis, the presence of gene-gene interactions, has been hypothesized to be at the root of many common human diseases, but current genome-wide association studies largely ignore its role. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a powerful model-free method for detecting epistatic relationships between genes, but computational costs have made its application to genome-wide data difficult. Graphics processing units (GPUs), the hardware responsible for rendering computer games, are powerful parallel processors. Using GPUs to run MDR on a genome-wide dataset allows for statistically rigorous testing of epistasis. Results: The implementation of MDR for GPUs (MDRGPU) includes core features of the widely used Java software package, MDR. This GPU implementation allows for large-scale analysis of epistasis at a dramatically lower cost than the standard CPU-based implementations. As a proof-of-concept, we applied this software to a genome-wide study of sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).We discovered a statistically significant two-SNP classifier and subsequently replicated the significance of these two SNPs in an independent study of ALS. MDRGPU makes the large-scale analysis of epistasis tractable and opens the door to statistically rigorous testing of interactions in genome-wide datasets.

abstract={Time-series models for count data have found increased interest in recent years. The existing literature refers to the case of data that have been fully observed. In this article, methods for estimating the parameters of the first-order integer-valued autoregressive model in the presence of missing data are proposed. The first method maximizes a conditional likelihood constructed via the observed data based on the k-step-ahead conditional distributions to account for the gaps in the data. The second approach is based on an iterative scheme where missing values are imputed so as to update the estimated parameters. The first method is useful when the predictive distributions have simple forms. We derive in full details this approach when the innovations are assumed to follow a finite mixture of Poisson distributions. The second method is applicable when there are no closed form expression for the conditional likelihood or they are hard to derive. The proposed methods are applied to a dataset concerning syndromic surveillance during the Athens 2004 Olympic Games. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={In the strategypro of classification setting, a set of labeled examples is partitioned among multiple agents. Given the reported labels, an optimal classification mechanism returns a classifier that minimizes the number of mislabeled examples. However, each agent is interested in the accuracy of the returned classifier on its own examples, and may mis-report its labels in order to achieve a better classifier, thus contaminating the dataset. The goal is to design strategypro of mechanisms that correctly label as many examples as possible. Previous work has investigated the foregoing setting under limiting assumptions, or with respect to very restricted classes of classifiers. In this paper, we study the strategypro of classification setting with respect to prominent classes of classifiers - boolean conjunctions and linear separators - and without any assumptions on the input. On the negative side, we show that, strategypro of mechanisms cannot achieve a constant approximation ratio, by showing that such mechanisms must be dictatorial on a subdomain, in the sense that the outcome is selected according to the preferences of a single agent. On the positive side, we present a randomized mechanism - Iterative Random Dictator - and demonstrate both that it is strategypro of and that its approximation ratio does not increase with the number of agents. Interestingly, the notion of dictatorship is prominently featured in all our results, helping to establish both upper and lower bounds.

abstract={Recent years have witnessed great prosperity in community-contributed multimedia. Discovering, extracting, and summarizing knowledge from these data enables us to make better sense of the world. In this paper, we report our work on mining famous city landmarks from blogs for personalized tourist suggestions. Our main contribution is a graph modeling framework to discover city landmarks by mining blog photo correlations with community supervision. This modeling fuses context, content, and community information in a style that simulates both static (PageRank) and dynamic (HITS) ranking models to highlight representative data from the consensus of blog users. Preliminary, we identify geographical locations of page contents to harvest city sight photos from Web blogs, based on which we structure these photos into a Scene-View hierarchy* within each city. Our graph modeling consists of two phases: First, within a given scene, we present a PhotoRank algorithm to discover its representative views, which analogizes PageRank to model context and content photo correlations for graph-based popularity propagation. Second, among scenes within each city, we present a Landmark-HITS model to discover city landmarks, which integrates author correlations to infer scene popularity in a semi-supervised reinforcement manner. Based on graph modeling, we further achieve personalized tourist suggestions by the collaborative filtering of tourism logs and author correlations. Based on a real-world dataset from Windows Live Spaces blogs containing nearly 400,000 sight photos, we have deployed our framework in a VisualTourism system, with comparisons to state-of-the-arts. We also investigate how the city popularities, user locations (e.g. Asian or Euro. blog users), and sequential events (e.g. Olympic Games) influence our Landmark discovery results and the tourist suggestion tendencies.

The problem is formulated as a sparsity constrained inverse problem. A dictionary made of atoms representing the silhouettes of a person at a given location is used within the problem formulation. A reweighted scheme is considered to better approximate the sparsity prior. Although the framework is generic to any scene, the focus of this paper is to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a basketball game. The main challenges come from the players' behavior, their similar appearance, and the mutual occlusions present in the views. In addition, the extracted foreground silhouettes are severely degraded due to the polished floor reflecting the players, and the strong shadow present in the scene.

We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques in two concrete Web applications: one in the educational domain and one in the cultural heritage domain. For the former we describe how students are better able to find the information in socially tagged videos and in the latter we also show how the used techniques allow building a faceted browser over the previously uncharted multimedia objects and we show which techniques could be applied to control the quality of user driven annotation. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Modern computer games are becoming increasingly complex and only experienced players can fully master the game controls. Accordingly, many commercial games now provide aids to simplify the player interaction. These aids are based on simple heuristics rules and cannot adapt neither to the current game situation nor to the player game style. In this paper, we suggest that supervised methods can be applied effectively to improve the quality of such game aids. In particular, we focus on the problem of developing an automatic weapon selection aid for Unreal Tournament III, a recent and very popular first person shooter (FPS). We propose a framework to (i) collect a dataset from game sessions, (ii) learn a policy to automatically select the weapon, and (iii) deploy the learned models in the game to replace the default weapon-switching aid provided in the game distribution. Our approach allows the development of weapon-switching policies that are aware of the current game context and can also imitate a particular game style. ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={The hidden knowledge in social networks data can be regarded as an important resource for criminal investigations which can help finding the structure and organization of a criminal network. However such network based analysis has not been studied in an applied way and remains mostly a manual process. To assist inspectors and intelligence agencies discover this knowledge, we defined a new problem and then proposed a framework for automated network data analysis and deduction approach from multiple social networks by converting to transaction dataset, applying association mining, and statistical methods. By applying a game theory concept in a multi-agent model, we try to design a policy for knowledge discovery and inference fusion. This approach enables police stations to build and deploy P2P applications through a unified medium for finding criminals relationship and identifying suspicious guys. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games (MMORPGs) are computer based games in which players interact with one another in the virtual world. Worldwide revenues for MMORPGs have seen amazing growth in last few years and it is more than a 2 billion dollars industry as per current estimates. Huge amount of revenue potential has attracted several gaming companies to launch online role playing games. One of the major problems these companies suffer apart from fierce competition is erosion of their customer base. Churn is a big problem for the gaming companies as churners impact negatively in the wordof- mouth reports for potential and existing customers leading to further erosion of user base. We study the problem of player churn in the popular MMORPG EverQuest II. The problem of churn prediction has been studied extensively in the past in various domains and social network analysis has recently been applied to the problem to understand the effects of the strength of social ties and the structure and dynamics of a social network in churn. In this paper, we propose a churn prediction model based on examining social influence among players and their personal engagement in the game. We hypothesize that social influence is a vector quantity, with components negative influence and positive influence. We propose a modified diffusion model to propagate the influence vector in the players network which represents the social influence on the player from his network. We measure a players personal engagement based on his activity patterns and use it in the modified diffusion model and churn prediction. Our method for churn prediction which combines social influence and player engagement factors has shown to improve prediction accuracy significantly for our dataset as compared to prediction using the conventional diffusion model or the player engagement factor, thus validating our hypothesis that combination of both these factors could lead to a more accurate churn prediction. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Enormous successes have been made by quantum algorithms during the last decade. In this paper, we combine the quantum game with the problem of data clustering, and then develop a quantum-game-based clustering algorithm, in which data points in a dataset are considered as players who can make decisions and implement quantum strategies in quantum games. After each round of a quantum game, each player's expected payoff is calculated. Later, he uses a link-removing-and-rewiring (LRR) function to change his neighbors and adjust the strength of links connecting to them in order to maximize his payoff. Further, algorithms are discussed and analyzed in two cases of strategies, two payoff matrixes and two LRR functions. Consequently, the simulation results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the clustering algorithms have fast rates of convergence. Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={The traditional, expert-based process of knowledge acquisition is known to be both slow and costly. With the advent of the Web 2.0, community-based approaches have appeared. These promise a similar or even higher level of information quantity by using the collaborative work of voluntary contributors. Yet, the community-driven approach yields new problems on its own, most prominently contributor motivation and data quality. Our former work [1] has shown, that the issue of contributor motivation can be solved by embedding the data collection activity into a gaming scenario. Additionally, good games are designed to be replayable and thus well suited to generate redundant datasets. In this paper we propose semantic view area clustering as a novel approach to aggregate semantically tagged objects to achieve a higher overall data quality. We also introduce the concept of semantic barriers as a method to account for interaction betwen spatial and semantic data. We also successfully evaluate our algorithm against a traditional clustering method. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

We describe a simple methodology for manually annotating museum exhibits with bags of keywords (viewed as item features), and present two personalised keyword-based models for predicting a visitor's viewing times of unseen exhibits from his/her viewing times at visited exhibits (viewing time is indicative of interest). Our models were evaluated with a real-world dataset of visitor pathways collected by tracking visitors in a museum.

A central problem facing practitioners is however the increasing complexity of user-game interaction in modern games, which places challenges on the evaluation of interaction using traditional user-oriented approaches. Gameplay metrics are instrumentation data which detail user behavior within the virtual environment of digital games, forming accurate and detailed datasets about user behavior that supplement existing user-testing methods such as playtesting and usability testing. In this paper existing work on gameplay metrics is reviewed, and spatial analysis of gameplay metrics introduced as a new approach in the toolbox of user-experience testing and research. Furthermore, Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are introduced as a tool for performing spatial analysis. A case study is presented with Tomb Raider: Underworld, showcasing the merger of GIS with gameplay metrics analysis and its application to game testing and design. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

This paper gives a new method to elicit user preferences that does not ask users to tell what they prefer, but rather what a random person would prefer, and rewards them if their prediction is correct. We provide an implementation of our method as a two-player game in which each player is shown two images and asked to click on the image their partner would prefer. The game has proven to be enjoyable, has attracted tens of thousands of people and has already collected millions of judgments. We compare several algorithms for combining these relative judgments between pairs of images into a total ordering of all images and present a new algorithm to perform collaborative filtering on pair-wise relative judgments. In addition, we show how merely observing user preferences on a specially chosen set of images can predict a user's gender with high probability. Copyright 2009 ACM.},

First, we made a model for "Buying-a-house", then using the dataset that we crawled and traced (we crawled about one hundred and fifty user's profiles and traced forty users for about twenty days), we draw the following findings: (1) People who just join the game have much interest in this OSN, actively interact with his friends. (2) The interest goes down according to the time lapse for most of users, but there are also a few players whose interests never go down and enjoy this game very much. These can be interpreted as the population of kaixin-net is growing at the beginning state, but it will decline after the peak comes. So the organizers should think about how to slow down the peak's coming. ©2009 IEEE.},

Such a program controls a character and allows the player to gain an unfair advantage over legitimate players, because repetitive and often boring tasks can be performed without any effort. Several methods for detecting bots have been proposed in the past. The method described in this research focuses on differences in the frequency of occurrence of different angles in the movement of bots and humans.

Local similarity measurement between trajectories is developed for trajectory matching to reduce the noise in the broadcast sports video. Transductive classifier with the learnt bias of low-level features of the trajectories is introduced to deal with different games and classify trajectories into tactic events only using a small labeled dataset. Frequent pattern mining is employed to find the tactics based on the subsequences of the classified trajectories.

abstract={Folksonomies, otherwise known as Collaborative Tagging Systems, enable Internet users to share, annotate and search for online resources with user selected labels called tags. Tag recommendation, the suggestion of an ordered set of tags during the annotation process, reduces the user effort from a keyboard entry to a mouse click. By simplifying the annotation process tagging is promoted, noise in the data is reduced through the elimination of discrepancies that result in redundant tags, and ambiguous tags may be avoided. Tag recommenders can suggest tags that maximize utility, offer tags the user may not have previously considered or steer users toward adopting a core vocabulary. In sum, tag recommendation promotes a denser dataset that is useful in its own right or can be exploited by a myriad of data mining techniques for additional functionality. While there exists a long history of recommendation algorithms, the data structure of a Folksonomy is distinct from those found in traditional recommendation problems. We first explore two data reduction techniques, p-core processing and Hebbian deflation, then demonstrate how to adaptK-Nearest Neighbor for use with Folksonomies by incorporating user, resource and tag information into the algorithm. We further investigate multiple techniques for user modeling required to compute the similarity among users. Additionally we demonstrate that tag boosting, the promoting of tags previously applied by a user to a resource, improves the coverage and accuracy of K-Nearest Neighbor. These techniques are evaluated through extensive experimentation using data collected from two real Collaborative Tagging Web sites. Finally the modified K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is compared with alternative techniques based on popularity and link analysis. We find that K-Nearest Neighbor modified for use with Folksonomies generates excellent recommendations, scales well with large datasets, and is applicable to both narrow and broadly focused Folksonomies.

abstract={In William Playfair's 1786 book, The Commercial and Political Atlas, he states that information, "imperfectly acquired, is generally as imperfectly retained." [6] Playfair is commenting on the failure of tables to represent comparative data in way that was useful to the reader. Since Playfair, many different forms of media have arisen beyond ink and paper. Yet printed charts (or their digital representations) remain, by far, the most commonly used tools of data visualization. Their evolution over many centuries has allowed them to achieve a degree of sophistication that time-based and interactive representations have yet to achieve. Is the supremacy of printed (or print-like) data visualization to remain unchallenged? Would it even need to be? The authors contend that new approaches may be possible, and even necessary, but would require tapping into a different way of learning that was not strictly about managing the short term visual and auditory memory of the readers [3]. This learning would involve less the experience of reading and more that of direct experience through play and games. Jesper Juul contends that all games are learning systems [2]. That is, to play a game and become good at it, the player must learn the necessary skills and strategies to overcome their opposition. If the goal of data visualization is educational, it may be possible to use specific types of games as ways of representing specific types of data. It may be possible for a player to learn the system of the game and the system of the information together. The authors have built three game prototypes that illustrate the ways in which different forms of data can be represented in the form of digital games. The first prototype, Kimono Colors, is based on data from a cross-referenced table that describes the types of ingredients used to create traditional Japanese dyes in the production of kimonos. The core mechanic [4] of the game has the player "fishing" for colors using one of several dyes the player has collected. By fishing for these colors, players learn the relationships between materials and the manufacture of dye. The second prototype, Mannahatta: The Game, asks players literally to walk around Manhattan and connect the living and non-living elements of a directed graph representing the ecology of the island 400 years ago. Played over an iPhone, users place themselves in the middle of the dataset they are piecing back together. The third prototype, Trees of Trade, uses data from two directed graphs of relationships, ecological and commercial, in a Brazilian Atlantic rain-forest ecosystem. The game involves the players re-establishing the trophic levels of the forest by navigating through the relationships and inserting the missing species on an idealized map. Through play, the user will better understand the elements of a system that is typically illustrated in a static, two dimensional directed graph illustration. Two questions stem from these prototypes: can data create play and can play enlighten data? To answer the first question affirmatively, we need to find evidence that a system created by data has the ability to produce "choice molecules" [4]. That is, in the form of a game, does the structure of data allow the player to make interesting choices about how to proceed as he or she navigates and elaborates the data? If so, then the data in question can create play, which in turn can drive the development of a full-fledged game. As for the second question, if the first answer holds, then the player is, in the course of a game, playing with the data. If the choices made available to a player are established in such a way that the player "levels up" through the information, then the achievement of the games goals will be coincident with the understanding of the data itself. By actively manipulating and using the data to win the game, the player will need to understand the facts and relationships inherent in the data itself, thus producing the desired educational outcome and a greater sensitivity to the systems that data represents. © 2009 Authors & Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA).},

abstract={Volume painting is an interactive segmentation technique for volumetric datasets. While volume painting facilitates quickly creating segmentations, e.g., for illustration purposes, segmenting features precisely is often problematic. The volume painting system we present addresses two common problems. First, we introduce several data-dependent painting mechanisms to make precisely segmenting features of interest easy. Second, we use game controllers such as a joystick and a gamepad to create a simple user interface to our system while still providing full control over the large amount of parameters of the painting mechanism. We demonstrate our work giving several examples and compare the effectiveness of the various brushes. We prove that our system is intuitive to use with preliminary user testing. The results indicate that our volume painting framework is an effective, interactive segmentation tool. Copyright © 2009 by the Association for Computing Machinery Inc.},

The distributions of hQ1i calculated by using NCEP1 are in good agreement with rainfall observations over the Arabian Sea/Indian Peninsula, the Bay of Bengal (BOB), and East China. The distributions of hQ1i revealed by using NCEP2 are unrealistic in the southern Indian Peninsula, the BOB, and the South China Sea. Using ERA, the heat sources over the tropical Asia are in accordance with the summer precipitation, however, the distributions of hQ1i in East China are unreasonable. In the tropical region, the distributions of the summer heat source given by NCEP1 and ERA seem to be more accurate than those revealed by NCEP2. The NCEP1 and NCEP2 data are better for calculating heat sources over the subtropical and eastern regions of mainland China.},

However, geometric approaches can be adapted for real-time implementation and hence are more appropriate for applications that demand realtime interactivity such as walk-through auralisation or scene rendering for computer game audio. This paper presents a method that facilitates real-time dynamic auralisation for wave-based approaches based on a pre-computed spatial subset of B-format encoded impulse responses for a given environment. Different methods are explored for post-simulation processing of this dataset to enable real-time dynamic auralisation based on both interpolation and Ambisonic-style manipulation of the resulting B-format impulse responses. Comparisons are made against a simple pre-computed walkthrough and demonstrate that this approach has significant potential for facilitating dynamic auralisation for wave-based room acoustic simulations. © EURASIP, 2009.},

abstract={The scientific field study of wildlife often requires vigilant observation of detailed animal behavior over extended periods. In remote and inhospitable locations, observation can be an arduous, expensive, and dangerous experience for field scientists. We are developing a new class of networked teleoperated robotic \observatories" that allows \citizen scientists" and professional scientists to remotely observe, record, and index animal activity and behaviors via the internet. This paper describes CONE-Welder, installed at the Rob & Bessie Welder Wildlife Foundation in Texas to gather photographic and quantitative data for a biological study of avian activity and hypothesized range change for selected subtropical bird species. Since the system was deployed on 12 May 2008, over 600 users (\players") have participated online. Players have requested over 2.2 million camera frames and captured over 29,000 photographs. Within these photos, citizen scientists have classified 74 unique species, including eight avian species previously unknown to have breeding populations within the region. The collected dataset quantifies seasonal presence of birds of particular interest, e.g., the Green Jay (Cyanocorax incas). This paper describes the system architecture, the game interface that provides incentives for player participation, and initial data collected. © 2009 IFAC.},

abstract={Geographical visualisation is an extremely powerful communication tool for better understanding landscape processes, functions and futures. Visual communication is an increasingly common part of environmental decision-making, being used as a 'common currency' to facilitate dialogue between policy-makers and non-experts to increase understanding and thereby improve the decisions made. In recent years we have witnessed the proliferation of geographical visualisation technologies such as digital globes, virtual worlds and game engines. Such technologies provide a powerful front-end to spatial datasets and models and support policy-makers, planners and communities to make better land management decisions. In order to create collaborative virtual environments where end users can fly-through landscapes and interact with one another in a virtual world there is a need for realistic, accessible and contextualised threedimensional (3D) objects. Collaborative virtual environments typically comprise: vegetation (trees, shrubs etc.), people (avatars), animals (domestic, wild) and built infrastructure (buildings, farm equipment, street furniture. Such 3D objects are the basic building blocks for creating a collaborative virtual environment. This paper reports on the development of a 3D object library which comprises flora, fauna and built infrastructure objects which can be used to create Australian virtual landscapes. The 3D object library is accessible through the Victorian Resources Online (VRO) website and is an online resource for scientists, students and communities to assist in building geographical visualisation products. Further research is necessary in working towards a robust 3D spatial data infrastructure to better support the storage management and dissemination of such information.},

Also Otsu pointed out that LDA could be regarded as a linear approximation of the ONDA through the linear approximations of the Bayesian posterior probabilities. Based on this theory, we propose a novel nonlinear discriminant analysis named logistic discriminant analysis (LgDA) in which the posterior probabilities are estimated by multi-nominal logistic regression (MLR).

To be unambiguous in metadata, Cyttron images are comprehensively annotated with ontology terms obtained from domain specific ontologies. But annotations also impose structure across the repository and enable connecting images across biological concepts. Such a networked structure, if justly conceptualized, can be insightful for the biology researcher. Our research focuses on communicating the emergent structure in ways that are both understandable and enjoyable. We investigate interactive views that employ metaphors other than the node-link diagram and propose gameplay as the means to internalize a semantic structure.

abstract={Alliances have critical value. This observation is especially pertinent given the dynamics of the most recent conflicts of our time. Traditional military modeling and simulation has focused on understanding the dynamics of the physical aspects of conflict. This is in contrast to role-playing games in which the formation of alliances is essential to victory (take Diplomacy as the perennial example and the modern game SuperPower as a recent example). It therefore seems reasonable to consider the formation of alliances as a subject that warrants modelling and simulation-based research. This paper outlines and extends a political science approach to modelling the formation of alliances, termed landscape theory. Landscape theory was formulated by the political scientist Robert Axelrod and is based on the Ising model of statistical mechanics. Between each nation or group an interaction propensity is calculated measuring the level of inter-nation influence and support. This propensity can range from positive values, in which nations are affable to negative where hostility exists. It is this collection of propensities that determines the global alliance structure. In Axelrod's model, the nation or group is characterised by a measure of its size or influence along with its propensities. Alliances are specified by defining a distance between the group or nation. The collection of distances between the nations is termed the configuration. If the distance between two nations is zero then they are considered to be in the same alliance. If greater than zero, then the nations are in different alliances. Given a collection of nations and propensities, any given configuration of alliances induces an energy function, which is the Ising equation of statistical mechanics. This function is a measure of the collective tension between nations. The principal of alliance prediction is based on the assumption that nations or groups seek to minimise this collective tension. Nations can alter their alliance structure by altering their configuration of distances. They seek to minimise the distance with nations that share a positive propensity and distance themselves to nations that have a negative propensity. Collectively, this process minimises the energy (Ising) function. Thus to predict a stable alliance configuration, given a set of nations and the corresponding propensities, the energy function is minimised and the resulting configuration is viewed. Our contribution is to extend landscape theory by a number of methods for calculating propensity based on importance weighted attributes from national statistics or historical data. Such attributes could include import/export levels, religious commonality, or data concerning past conflicts. These methods are applied to a dataset derived from hypothetical international data to make predictions of alliance structures. Methods for adjusting the importance of different attributes that make up the propensity values, in light of new alliance data are then briefly discussed. Here, a predicted structure does not match the outcome and therefore the adjustment of attribute importance is vital. Finally, we discuss future topics of research in the modelling of alliance formation.},

abstract={In this chapter, we present two datasets from Africa, one rural and one urban, in which we examine the correlates of individual-level demographics and trusting and trustworthy behavior in economic experiments. We use a slightly modified version of the Joyce Berg, John Dickhaut, and Kevin McCabe investment game (1995). Our primary original contribution is to include in these demographics data on each individual's standing in their social network (compare Alesina and La Ferrara 2002; Anderson, Mellor, and Milyo 2005a, 2005b; Bouckaert and Dhaene 2003; Burns 2004; Chaudhury and Gangadharan 2003; Croson and Buchan 1999; DeBruine 2002; Eckel and Wilson 2003, 2004). We hypothesize that those who are pivotally and centrally located in social networks hold such positions because they have established and maintained reputations as successful social and political entrepreneurs, and that such positions are achieved in part by demonstrating trustworthiness. We define political entrepreneurs as those who strategically cultivate, create, and invest in social relationships to enhance their bargaining power and political brokerage abilities in areas such as conflict management and institutional change (compare Schneider and Teske 1992). This is a quality we believe is well identified by conventional measures of social network centrality (compare Christopoulos 2006). Further, we hypothesize that such entrepreneurs are risk takers by nature, and that this propels them to risk trusting to reap the rewards of cooperation that stem from such behavior. Inclinations to trust are further reinforced by the greater access to information, including information concerning who is worthy of trust, that such pivotal positions in the social network afford. Social networks are central to the concept of social capital as most people use the term, but studies of social capital have suffered from a lack of conceptual clarity. The metaphorical use of the concept and the looseness with which the term social capital has been operationalized, together with the power with which some have endowed an ill-defined version of the concept, has lead to some discounting the entire concept. In this chapter, we seek to differentiate individual from group-level concepts of social capital and attempt to restore some clarity to the concept. We then take the individual component of social capital that exists as social or political entrepreneur-ship, and use social network analysis to provide precise measures of this individual-level trait. Finally, we derive specific predictions about the relationship between network position and the relative level of trust and trustworthiness exhibited by individuals within a given society.

abstract={Recent storm analyses and site-specific Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) studies completed in Arizona revealed the inadequacies of HMR 49 in properly representing storm characteristics and PMP throughout the region. To address the numerous issues associated with HMR 49, Applied Weather Associates (AWA) is conducting a statewide, storm based PMP project for the state of Arizona to replace HMR 49. AWA is working directly with a consortium of stakeholders, including Arizona DWR, various dam owners, the Department of Game and Fish, the state climatologist, and others in this important project. HMR 49 was published in 1977 and is the oldest of the HMRs currently in use. More recent HMRs use updated storm data and PMP analysis procedures. HMR 49 used outdated methods and techniques that have subsequently been improved through new understanding of meteorology and updated datasets. A major issue with HMR 49 is the lack of storm data used to develop the PMP values. Only a handful of storms were investigated during the development of HMR 49, none of which were analyzed using individual storm depth-area-duration (DAD) values. This combined with the fact that the document covers such a widely varying region both climatologically and topographically, further validates the necessity for an update. AWA has incorporated updated databases and procedures as part of several recently completed and current site-specific, statewide, and regional PMP projects. These improvements include, but are not limited to: updated storm databases (the newest HMR storm analyzed is from the mid-1990's), ntegrating the storm precipitation. Analysis System (SPAS) with Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) to better spatially and temporally distribute rainfall, integration of GIS to analyze orographics and controlling topography, updated dew point climatology to better represent atmospheric moisture, and updated storm analysis techniques. An extensive storm database constructed from an comprehensive storm search, previous project results, and other sources is being used to develop a database of storms. The most extreme of these events are being individually analyzed during the statewide PMP project to derive the final PMP values. The storm list contains numerous storms in each climate division as well as each storm type (local convective, general synoptic and decaying tropical) that affects Arizona. These storm analyses will allow for a storm based PMP to be developed for all points within the state, much the same as was completed by AWA for the state of Nebraska in 2008. © 2009 Omnipress.},

All existing techniques, however, assume a static environment, limiting their utility in emerging applications (e.g., Location-based Services) where objects move. In this paper, for the first time, we propose two exact methods that can continuously answer skNN queries in a highly dynamic environment which allows for arbitrary movements of data objects. The first method, inspired by the existing techniques in monitoring kNN in road networks [7] maintains an analogous counterpart of the Dijkstra Expansion Tree on land surface, called Surface Expansion Tree (SE-Tree). However, we show the concept of expansion tree for land surface does not work as SEtree suffers from intrinsic defects: it is fat and short, and hence does not improve the query efficiency. Therefore, we propose a superior approach that partitions SE-Tree into hierarchical chunks of pre-computed surface distances, called Angular Surface Index Tree (ASI-Tree). Unlike SE-tree, ASI-Tree is a well balanced thin and tall tree. With ASI-Tree, we can continuously monitor skNN queries efficiently with low CPU and I/O overheads by both speeding up the surface shortest path computations and localizing the searches. We experimentally verify the applicability and evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methods with both real world and synthetic data sets. ASI-Tree consistently and significantly outperforms SE-Tree in all cases. © 2009 VLDB Endowment.},

abstract={Background. Human geneticists are now capable of measuring more than one million DNA sequence variations from across the human genome. The new challenge is to develop computationally feasible methods capable of analyzing these data for associations with common human disease, particularly in the context of epistasis. Epistasis describes the situation where multiple genes interact in a complex non-linear manner to determine an individual's disease risk and is thought to be ubiquitous for common diseases. Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) is an algorithm capable of detecting epistasis. An exhaustive analysis with MDR is often computationally expensive, particularly for high order interactions. This challenge has previously been met with parallel computation and expensive hardware. The option we examine here exploits commodity hardware designed for computer graphics. In modern computers Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have more memory bandwidth and computational capability than Central Processing Units (CPUs) and are well suited to this problem. Advances in the video game industry have led to an economy of scale creating a situation where these powerful components are readily available at very low cost. Here we implement and evaluate the performance of the MDR algorithm on GPUs. Of primary interest are the time required for an epistasis analysis and the price to performance ratio of available solutions. Findings. We found that using MDR on GPUs consistently increased performance per machine over both a feature rich Java software package and a C++ cluster implementation. The performance of a GPU workstation running a GPU implementation reduces computation time by a factor of 160 compared to an 8-core workstation running the Java implementation on CPUs. This GPU workstation performs similarly to 150 cores running an optimized C++ implementation on a Beowulf cluster. Furthermore this GPU system provides extremely cost effective performance while leaving the CPU available for other tasks. The GPU workstation containing three GPUs costs $2000 while obtaining similar performance on a Beowulf cluster requires 150 CPU cores which, including the added infrastructure and support cost of the cluster system, cost approximately $82,500. Conclusion. Graphics hardware based computing provides a cost effective means to perform genetic analysis of epistasis using MDR on large datasets without the infrastructure of a computing cluster. © 2009 Sinnott-Armstrong et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={This paper proposes a novel approach to motion capture from multiple, synchronized video streams, specifically aimed at recording dense and accurate models of the structure and motion of highly deformable surfaces such as skin, that stretches, shrinks, and shears in the midst of normal facial expressions. Solving this problem is a key step toward effective performance capture for the entertainment industry, but progress so far has been hampered by the lack of appropriate local motion and smoothness models. The main technical contribution of this paper is a novel approach to regularization adapted to nonrigid tangential deformations. Concretely, we estimate the nonrigid deformation parameters at each vertex of a surface mesh, smooth them over a local neighborhood for robustness, and use them to regularize the tangential motion estimation. To demonstrate the power of the proposed approach, we have integrated it into our previous work for markerless motion capture [9], and compared the performances of the original and new algorithms on three extremely challenging face datasets that include highly nonrigid skin deformations, wrinkles, and quickly changing expressions. Additional experiments with a dataset featuring fast-moving cloth with complex and evolving fold structures demonstrate that the adaptability of the proposed regularization scheme to nonrigid tangential motion does not hamper its robustness, since it successfully recovers the shape and motion of the cloth without overfitting it despite the absence of stretch or shear in this case ©2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Discovery of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) or DNA motifs in promoter regions of genes plays a key role in understanding the regulations of gene expression. In the past decade computational approaches, including evolutionary computation techniques, for searching for motifs have demonstrated good potential, and some results reported in literature are quite promising. Recently, some favorable progresses on evolutionary mining of motifs have been made and documented in GAME and GALF-P, where GAME employs a Bayesian-based scoring function and GALF-P aims to improve the algorithm performance with local filtering and adaptive post-processing. To improve discovering performance in terms of the recall, precision rates and algorithm reliability, this paper presents an alternative genetic algorithm termed as GAPK for resolving the problem of motifs discovery. In our proposed GAPK framework, a prior knowledge on motifs in a given dataset is used to initialize a population. Our technical contributions include a matrix representation for k-mers, a mismatch-based filtering method for search space reduction, a model mismatch score (MMS) as fitness function, new genetic operations and a model refinement processing. Some benchmarked datasets associated with eight transcription factors are used in our experiments. Comparative studies were carried out with well-known tools including GAME, GALF-P, MEME, MDScan and AlignACE. Results show that our method outperforms other techniques in terms of F-measure. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Inter-domain peering links represent nowadays the real bottleneck of the Internet. On peering links carriers may coordinate to efficiently balance the load, but the current practice is often based on an uncoordinated selfish routing supported by the peer relationship.We present a novel game theoretical routing framework to efficiently coordinate the routing on peering links while modelling the non-cooperative carrier behaviour. It relies on a collaborative use of the Multi-Exit Discriminator (MED) attribute of BGP, hence it is nicknamed ClubMED (Coordinated MED). The incentives are the minimization of carrier routing costs, the control of peering link congestions and peering route stability. For the ClubMED game, we define the Nash Equilibrium Multi-Path (NEMP) routing policy that shall be implemented upon Nash equilibria and Pareto-efficient profiles. Intra-domain Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) weight optimizations are consistently integrated into the framework. We emulated the peering settlement between the Internet2 and the Geant2 networks, employing real datasets, comparing the ClubMED results to the current BGP practice. The results show that the global routing cost can be reduced of roughly 17%, that the peering link congestion can be avoided and that the stability of the routes can significantly be reinforced1.},

The information content (IC) or relative entropy of the motif has proven to be a good estimator of transcription factor DNA binding affinity. However, these information-based metrics are usually used as a posteriori statistics rather than during the motif search process itself. Results: We introduce here info-gibbs, a Gibbs sampling algorithm that efficiently optimizes the IC or the log-likelihood ratio (LLR) of the motif while keeping computation time low. The method compares well with existing methods like MEME, BioProspector, Gibbs or GAME on both synthetic and biological datasets. Our study shows that motif discovery techniques can be enhanced by directly focusing the search on the motif IC or the motif LLR. © The Author 2009. Published by Oxford University Press.

abstract={The vast amount of information presented in museums is often overwhelming to a visitor, making it difficult to select personally interesting exhibits. Advances in mobile computing and user modelling have made possible technology that can assist a visitor in this selection process. Such a technology can (1) utilise non-intrusive observations of a visitor's behaviour in the physical space to learn a model of his/her interests, and (2) generate personalised exhibit recommendations based on interest predictions. Due to the physicality of the domain, datasets of visitors' behaviour (i.e. visitor pathways) are difficult to obtain prior to deploying mobile technology in a museum. However, they are necessary to assess different modelling techniques. This paper reports on a methodology that we used to conduct a manual data collection, and describes the dataset we obtained. We also present two collaborative models for predicting a visitor's viewing times of unseen exhibits from his/her viewing times at visited exhibits (viewing time is indicative of interest), and evaluate our models with the dataset we collected.

abstract={Source IP addresses are often used as a major feature for user modeling in computer networks. Particularly in the field of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack detection and mitigation traffic models make extensive use of source IP addresses for detecting anomalies. Typically the real IP address distribution is strongly undersampled due to a small amount of observations. Density estimation overcomes this shortage by taking advantage of IP neighborhood relations. In many cases simple models are implicitly used or chosen intuitively as a network based heuristic. In this paper we review and formalize existing models including a hierarchical clustering approach first.In addition, we present a modified k-means clustering algorithm for source IP density estimation as well as a statistical motivated smoothing approach using the Nadaraya-Watson kernel-weighted average. For performance evaluation we apply all methods on a 90 days real world dataset consisting of 1.3 million different source IP addresses and try to predict the users of the following next 10 days. ROC curves and an example DDoS mitigation scenario show that there is no uniformly better approach: kmeans performs best when a high detection rate is needed whereas statistical smoothing works better for low false alarm rate requirements like the DDoS mitigation scenario. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={In brain white matter fiber tractography, diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (DT-MRI) can be used to reconstruct the three dimensional structures of the white matter fibers noninvasively. The commonly used tracking method is usually based on the local diffusion information and insufficient to consider the geometrical structure of the whole fiber bundle. Therefore, a novel method of fiber tracking using Bayesian decision stochastic model is proposed. In this method, from the diffusion tensor directions of the current voxel and the structure information of the current fiber segment, the probability distributions of the tracking directions of the next voxel is estimated using Bayesian decision theory. Then, according to the probability distributions, the fiber bundle is sampled and the 3D image of its structure is reconstructed. By the method, imaging simulations using a synthetic diffusion tensor dataset and imaging experiments using an in vivo brain DT-MRI dataset have been done. The results of the simulations and experiments demonstrate that using the method proposed, brain white matter fiber can be reconstructed properly as expected, more reliably and repeatedly compared with the common methods.},

abstract={Problem statement: Recently, 3D objects have been used in several applications like internet games, virtual reality and scientific visualization. These applications require real time rendering and fast transmission of large objects through internet. However, due to limitation of bandwidth, the compression and streaming of 3D object is still an open research problem. Approach: Novel procedure for compression and coding of 3-Dimensional (3-D) semi-regular meshes using wavelet transform had been introduced. This procedure was based on Space Frequency Quantization (SFQ) which was used to minimize distortion error of reconstructed mesh for a different bit-rate constraint. Results: Experimental results had been carried out over five datasets with different mesh intense and irregularity. Results were evaluated by using the peak signal to noise ratio as an error measurement. Experiments showed that 3D SFQ code over performs Progressive Geometry Coder (PGC) in terms of quality of compressed meshes. Conclusion: A pure 3D geometry coding algorithm based on wavelet had been introduced. Proposed procedure showed its superiority over the state of art coding techniques.

abstract={A 3D interactive graphics application is an extremely computational demanding paradigm, requiring the simulation and display of a virtual environment at interactive frame rates. It is significant in real time game environment. Even with the use of powerful graphics workstations, a moderately complex virtual environment can involve a vast amount of computation, inducing a noticeable lag into the system. This lag can detrimentally affect the visual effect and may therefore severely compromise the diffusion of the quality of graphics application. This paper introduced to overcome the limitation of conventional technique. Surface attributes such as normal, colors and textures, which are essentials to bring out the beauty of 3D object are preserved and discussed. The first process is to convert the input data into a memory efficient format. Next, the datasets are organized in an octree structure and later the partitioned meshes are kept in secondary memory (hard disk). Subsequently, submeshes are simplified using a new variation of vertex clustering technique. In order to maintain the surface attributes, a vertex clustering technique that collapses all triangles in every leaf node using the generalized quadric error metrics is introduced. Unlike any other vertex clustering methods, the knowledge of neighbourhood between nodes is unnecessary and the node simplification is performed independently. Overall, the proposed algorithm is capable in simplifying large datasets with pleasant quality and relatively fast. The system can run efficiently on low cost personal computer with small memory footprint. © 2009 IEEE.},

abstract={Real-life spatial objects are usually described by their geographic locations (e.g., longitude and latitude), and multiple quality attributes. Conventionally, spatial data are queried by two orthogonal aspects: spatial queries involve geographic locations only; skyline queries are used to retrieve those objects that are not dominated by others on all quality attributes. Specifically, an object p i is said to dominate another object p j if p i is no worse than p j on all quality attributes and better than p j on at least one quality attribute. In this paper, we study a novel query that combines both aspects meaningfully. Given two spatial datasets P and S, and a neighborhood distance δ, the most endangered object query (MEO) returns the object s∈ ∈S such that within the distance δ from s, the number of objects in P that dominate s is maximized. MEO queries appropriately capture the needs that neither spatial queries nor skyline queries alone have addressed. They have various practical applications such as business planning, online war games, and wild animal protection. Nevertheless, the processing of MEO queries is challenging and it cannot be efficiently evaluated by existing solutions. Motivated by this, we propose several algorithms for processing MEO queries, which can be applied in different scenarios where different indexes are available on spatial datasets. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets show that our proposed advanced spatial join solution achieves the best performance and it is scalable to large datasets. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Using a new dataset on the stringency and enforcement of environmental policy, this study is the first to find robust confirmation of a pollution haven effect in a cross-country context by accounting for strategically determined environment, trade, and intellectual property right (IPR) policies. A simple game theoretic approach to policy determination is described which suggests an identification strategy based on other country characteristics. It is found that for the top 20th percentile of countries in terms of growth in U.S multinational affiliate value added, as much as 8.6% of that growth between 1999 and 2003 can be attributed to declining relative stringency and enforcement of environmental policy. The results are robust to a number of identification tests, weak IV tests, and third country spatial effects. Further, evidence is found that relatively 'footloose' industries are more likely to be affected by environmental policy than more traditionally 'dirty' industries and enforcement of environmental policies tends to be a more important deterrent than the stringency of the policy set. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Agricultural change has transformed large areas of traditional farming landscapes, leading to important changes in the species community assemblages in most European countries. We suspect that the drastic changes in land-use that have occurred in Andalusia (southern Spain) over recent decades, may have affected the distribution and abundance of game species in this region. This article compares the distribution of the main game species in Andalusia during the 1960s and 1990s, using data from maps available from the Mainland Spanish Fish, Game and National Parks Service and from recent datasets on hunting yield distributions, respectively. Big-game and small-game species were significantly segregated in southern Spain during the 1990s, as two clearly independent chorotypes (groups of species whose abundances are similarly distributed) were obtained from the classification analysis. In contrast, big-game and small-game species were not significantly segregated several decades ago, when there was only one chorotype consisting of small-game species and wild boar. The other three ungulates did not constitute a significant chorotype, as they showed positive correlations with some species in the group mentioned above. These changes seem to be a consequence of the transformations that have occurred in the Iberian Mediterranean landscape over the last few decades. The abandoning of traditional activities, and the consequent formation of dense scrubland and woodland, has led to an expansion of big-game species, and a decrease of small-game species in mountain areas. Moreover, agricultural intensification has apparently depleted small-game species populations in some agricultural areas. On the other hand, the increasingly intensive hunting management could be artificially boosting this segregation between small-game and big-game species. Our results suggest that the conservation and regeneration of traditional agricultural landscapes (like those predominating in the 1960s) should be a priority for the conservation of small-game species. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Significant progress has been made in high-quality hair rendering, but it remains difficult to choose parameter values that reproduce a given real hair appearance. In particular, for applications such as games where naive users want to create their own avatars, tuning complex parameters is not practical. Our approach analyses a single flash photograph and estimates model parameters that reproduce the visual likeness of the observed hair. The estimated parameters include color absorptions, three reflectance lobe parameters of a multiple-scattering rendering model, and a geometric noise parameter. We use a novel melanin-based model to capture the natural subspace of hair absorption parameters. At its core, the method assumes that images of hair with similar color distributions are also similar in appearance. This allows us to recast the issue as an image retrieval problem where the photo is matched with a dataset of rendered images; we thus also match the model parameters used to generate these images. An earth-mover's distance is used between luminance-weighted color distributions to gauge similarity. We conduct a perceptual experiment to evaluate this metric in the context of hair appearance and demonstrate the method on 64 photographs, showing that it can achieve a visual likeness for a large variety of input photos. © 2009 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={An increasing number of countries show a trend towards a certain degree of consolidation of powers in financial supervision, which has resulted in the establishment of unified regulators, that are different from the national central banks. By contrast a high involvement of the central bank in supervision seems to be correlated with a multi-authorities regime (central bank fragmentation effect). This paper, using a simple application of a general common agency game, sheds light on which conditions the politicians prefer when implementing an unified sector supervision outside the central bank. From a theoretical point of view the quality of public sector governance plays a crucial role in determining the supervision unification. Focusing on the behaviour of the "good" policymaker (helping hand type), it will prefer a unified financial authority that is different from the central bank if the correspondent welfare gains-linked to at least one of the three effects: moral hazard, conflict of interest, bureaucracy-are considered higher respect to the information losses. The "bad" policymaker (grabbing hand type) will choose the single financial authority if the financial industry likes it, and the central bank is not a captured one. On the other hand, the paper tests the model, confirming the robustness of the institutional position of the central bank in explaining the recent trend in supervision consolidation, with an empirical analysis performed with ordered functions on an updated dataset. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={The Congo Basin contains the world's second largest expanse of tropical rainforest, and yet also within the catchment lies an extensive, geographically isolated forest-savannah mosaic. While the forests in this region have long been considered an important stronghold for leopards, Panthera pardus, the apex predator in this habitat, the forest-savannah mosaic also once harboured important populations of lions, Panthera leo, African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus, and spotted hyaenas, Crocuta crocuta. Uncontrolled hunting by man, however, has led to a dramatic decrease in ungulate populations, especially in the more accessible open habitats. Today, lions and African wild dogs are almost certainly regionally extinct, while spotted hyaenas have been reduced to one small and isolated population in the Republic of Congo. In remote forest regions, wildlife populations have remained less severely affected, but in densely populated areas where demand for wild game is high, intensive commercial hunting has led to a widespread disappearance of leopards, even from within protected areas. Conservation efforts directed towards leopards and spotted hyaenas should promote rigorous protection of remaining populations and their prey to prevent any further range loss. Owing to the present geographical isolation of their former range within this region, however, any effort to re-establish lions or African wild dogs would inevitably need to involve reintroduction. Most suitable habitat is currently without protection and wild prey is scarce, so potential reintroductions would need to be preceded by the creation of suffi ciently large protected areas and their restocking with prey, provided that government and local support for such a proposal could be acquired and guaranteed for the long term. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={A system is seriously required for helping users to find their path on the shopping and entertainment web sites where the amounts of on-line information vastly increase. Therefore, recommender systems, new type of internet based software tool, appeared, and became an appealing subject for researchers. Collaborative filtering (CF) technique based on user is the one of the method widely used by recommender systems but they have some problems for waiting to be developed solutions that are more efficient. One of these mainly problems is data sparsity. While the number of products is increase, the ratio of common rated products is decrease so calculating the computations of neighbourhood become difficult. The other one is scalability which is the performance problem of the existing algorithms on the datasets has large amounts of information. In this article, we tackle these two questions: (1) how the data sparsity can be reduced ? (2) How to make recommendation algorithms more scalable? We present an approach to addressing the both of these problems at the same time by using a new CF model, constructed based on the Artificial Immune Network Algorithm (aiNet). It is chosen because aiNet is capable of reducing sparsity and providing the scalability of dataset via describing data structure, including their spatial distribution and cluster inter-relations. The new user-item ratings dataset reduced by applying aiNet (aiNetDS) given more stable results and produced predictions more quickly than the raw user-item ratings dataset (rawDS). Besides, the effects of using clustering for forming the neighbourhoods to the system performance are investigated. For this, both of these dataset are clustered by using k-means algorithm and then these cluster partitions are used as neighbourhoods. As a result, it has been shown that the clustered aiNetDS is given more accurate and quick results than the others are. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We analyze boosting from a game-theoretic perspective and define a new class of boosting algorithms called H-boosting methods. In the experimental part of this work we apply the new classifier together with classical and state-of-the-art algorithms to classify ovarian cancer and cystic fibrosis patients based on peptide mass spectra. The methods developed here provide automatic, general, and efficient means for processing of large scale LC-MS datasets.

abstract={Is the quality of interconnection between Internet operators affected by their asymmetry? While recent game theoretic literature provides contrasting answers to this question, there is a lack of empirical research. We introduce a novel dataset based on Internet routing policies, and study the interconnection decisions amongst the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that are members of the London Internet Exchange Point (LINX). Our results show that interconnection quality degradation can be significantly explained by asymmetry between providers. We also show that Competition Authorities should also focus on the "centrality of an operator", and not only on its market share. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The propagation characteristics of the atmospheric low frequency (LF, 30-60 days) oscillation (LFO) around the Tibetan Plateau from troposphere to stratosphere and its relationship with the floods over the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River in the summer of 1998 are studied, based on the GAME dataset from Meteorological Research Institute (MRI)/Japan Meteorological Agency, the TRMM satellite rainfall and the 730-station precipitation over China. The results show that the zonal propagation direction of LFOs in horizontal winds varies with seasons in the troposphere during May to August in 1998. The eastward propagation of LFOs is remarkable before the start of the rainy season in the Tibetan Plateau and the eastern Asian continent, while the westward propagation is significant after the start date. The northward LFOs from the south side of the plateau and the southward LFOs from the north are both significant before and after the start date. The plateau is a LFO sink in the meridional and zonal directions, but the west part of it is an intensifying area for the continual westward LFOs only after the start of the rainy season. Besides, the strongest LFOs occur at the tropopause (100 hPa) and rapidly decay after entering the stratosphere. The rainfall over the mid-low reaches of Yangtze River in the summer of 1998 exhibits two LFO cycles. According to the phases of the two rainfall LFO cycles, the composite analyses of precipitation distribution, LF circulations at 500 and 100 hPa, and LF vertical motion along 30°N are performed. It is the joint effect of the mid-upper tropospheric strong 30-60-day filtered cyclone (anticyclone) over the eastern plateau and the LFO anticyclone (cyclone) over the west subtropical Pacific that induces the whole layer LF descending (ascending) motion over the mid-lower reaches of Yangtze River, which provides the favorable condition for the break (maintenance) of precipitation.},

abstract={With the rapidly increasing ease of access to the Internet in people's homes, more and more of our everyday activities are being carried out online. While the home has become what might be called a communication hub, open to question is the impact this virtual mobility is having on our physical mobility. The questions we address in this article concern the extent to which network communication is carried out in our homes and this in relation to (1) activities that demand transport, (2) those of us who utilize these options, and (3) the virtual and physical mobility/communication patterns. Data from a nationwide Norwegian sample are utilized in investigating these questions. The dataset comprises 2700 respondents with access to the Internet at home and who answered questions about daily travel and home-based use of information and communication technology (ICT) for purposes such as information-seeking, shopping, paid work, net-banking, chatting and playing games. The analysis indicates that while use of the Internet for many of these activities is common, it varies between groups. We discuss whether virtual activities have physical equivalents - physical twins - or whether these come in addition to previous equivalent activities. It is shown that the relation between virtual and physical mobility varies depending on type of activity and social group, but, overall, that is not very strong. One possible explanation is that many new ICT services and applications do not have as clear-cut functional equivalents - or physical twins - as many of the earlier ICT technologies had, and, if true, will make it increasingly difficult to track down the interplay between transport and communication. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Background: Alcohol misuse among college students remains a pervasive problem. Relatively little is known about alcohol consumption by incoming students during the summer between high school graduation and the start of the freshman year. It is possible that many students bring unhealthy drinking habits with them to college. Purpose: The present study examined patterns of alcohol use and related consequences among incoming college students during the summer before their freshman year. Methods: The dataset consisted of self-reported two-week drinking histories from 4,539 incoming freshmen at three universities during the summer of 2003. An average of 80% of all incoming students at the schools was surveyed. In the present study, drinking patterns, risk and protective factors, and alcohol-related consequences were examined. Results: Roughly 50% of college-bound students consumed alcohol in the two weeks before the survey. Nearly 30% of all students met or exceeded the threshold for binge drinking (4+ drinks for females; 5+ drinks for males). Among those who drank during the two weeks before the survey, roughly 50% of males and females consumed shots, 50% played drinking games, and 36% suffered hangovers. More than one in ten males and females experienced memory blackouts during the two-week period. Fourteen percent of males and 10% of females drove after drinking. Females were twice as likely as males to drink on an empty stomach to get drunk faster (8.2% and 4.1%) and four times as likely to drink on an empty stomach to save calories (12.8% and 2.9%). Discussion: Many students bring unhealthy drinking habits with them to college and experience blackouts, hangovers, and other consequences during the summer before they arrive on campus. Translation to Health Education Practice: Alcohol education and prevention programs should target students prior to their arrival on college campuses.},

Efforts to address this question have traditionally relied upon setter models borrowed from the congressional literature and have predicted legislative dominance. We offer an alternative simplification of state budget negotiations that follows the "staring match" logic captured by dividethe-dollar games. Our model predicts that governors will often be powerful but that professional legislatures can stand up to the executives when long legislative sessions give them the patience to endure a protracted battle over the size of the budget. In this article, we present our analysis of an original dataset comprising gubernatorial budget proposals and legislative enactments in the states from 1989 through 2004.

Collecting a large amount of data about each strategy profile im-proves confidence, but restricts the range of strategies and profiles that can be explored. We propose a flexible approach, where multiple game-theoretic formulations can be constructed to model the same underlying scenario (observation dataset). The prospect of incorrectly selecting an empirical model is termed generalization risk, and the generalization risk framework we describe provides a general criterion for empirical modeling choices, such as adoption of factored strategies or other structured representations of a game model. We propose a principled method of managing gener-alization risk to derive the optimal game-theoretic model for the observed data in a restricted class of models. Application to a large dataset generated from a trading agent scenario validates the method . Copyright © 2009, International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.},

The article also addresses the issue of an alleged perfect correlation being induced between CFC emission cutbacks and GNP due to the imputation process used by WRI.

The first step in the development of such security methodologies is wide availability of datasets necessary for training and testing of those biologically inspired systems. In this paper we present a manual and automated approach to generation of parameterized datasets containing facial images of avatars representing typical entities in the virtual worlds.

To segment a nonideal iris image accurately, we deploy a variational level set based curve evolution scheme, which uses significantly larger time step for numerically solving the evolution partial differential equation (PDE), and therefore, speeds up the curve evolution process drastically. Daubechies Wavelet Transform (DBWT) is used to extract the textural features, and an iterative algorithm, called the Contribution-Selection Algorithm (CSA), in the context of coalitional game theory is used to select a subset of informative features without compromising the recognition rate. The verification performance of the proposed scheme is validated using the UBIRIS Version 2, the ICE 2005, and the WVU datasets. ©2009 IEEE.},

This paper addresses these questions by applying a dataset that includes information on preferred/rejected coalition partners and the policy-area specific programmatic heterogeneity of all potential coalitions. The results show that pre-electoral commitments have a significant impact on government formation after controlling for endogeneity problems.

abstract={Models of the enforcement of environmental regulations regarding point source pollution suppose that the probability of inspection or audit is independent across facilities. However, there are a number of reasons why regulators may choose to inspect many sites in a particular geographic area at one time. If the probability a site is inspected also depends on its compliance behavior, the expected payoff from choosing to violate will depend upon the compliance decisions of neighboring sites, creating a game of strategic interdependence between firms. In this paper, we use a dataset of inspections at petroleum storage sites in Manitoba between 1981 and 1998 to consider to what extent inspections are spatially correlated and whether inspection probabilities are a function of the inspection and violation history of the site and its neighbors. Further, we examine to what extent firms take into account whether their neighbors have been previously found in violation in determining compliance. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

In this paper, we present an intuitive and powerful animation interface to simultaneously control the deformation of a large number of local regions on a deformable surface with a minimal number of control points. Our method learns suitable deformation subspaces from training examples, and generate new deformations on the fly according to the movements of the control points. Our contributions include a novel deformation regression method based on kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and a Poisson-based translation solving technique for easy and fast deformation control based on examples. Our run-time algorithm can be implemented on GPUs and can achieve a few hundred frames per second even for large datasets with hundreds of training examples. © 2008 ACM.},

In this poster, we consider Web browsing behavior outside of interactions with retrieval systems (i.e., users' "walk") as an alternative source of signal describing users' information needs, and compare it to the query-expressed information needs on a large dataset. Our findings demonstrate that information needs expressed in different behavior modalities are largely non-overlapping, and that past behavior in each modality is the most accurate predictor of future behavior in that modality. Results also show that browsing data provides a stronger source of signal than search queries due to its greater volume, which explains previous work that has found implicit behavioral data to be a valuable source of information for user modeling and personalization.},

abstract={Museums offer vast amounts of information, but a visitor's receptivity and time are typically limited, providing the visitor with the challenge of selecting the (subjectively) interesting exhibits to view within the available time. Mobile, electronic handheld guides offer the opportunity to improve a visitor's experience by recommending exhibits of interest, and adapting the delivered content. The first step in this personalisation process is the prediction of a visitor's activities and interests. In this paper we study non-intrusive, adaptive user modelling techniques that take into account the physical constraints of the exhibition layout. We present two collaborative models for predicting a visitor's next locations in a museum, and an ensemble model that combines the predictions of these models. The three models were trained and tested on a small dataset of museum visits. Our results are encouraging, with the ensemble model yielding the best performance overall. © 2008 IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={A primary challenge to large-scale data integration is creating semantic equivalences between elements from different data sources that correspond to the same real-world entity or concept. Dataspaces propose a pay-as-you-go approach: automated mechanisms such as schema matching and reference reconciliation provide initial correspondences, termed candidate matches, and then user feedback is used to incrementally confirm these matches. The key to this approach is to determine in what order to solicit user feedback for confirming candidate matches. In this paper, we develop a decision-theoretic framework for ordering candidate matches for user confirmation using the concept of the value of perfect information (VPI). At the core of this concept is a utility function that quantifies the desirability of a given state; thus, we devise a utility function for dataspaces based on query result quality. We show in practice how to efficiently apply VPI in concert with this utility function to order user confirmations. A detailed experimental evaluation on both real and synthetic datasets shows that the ordering of user feedback produced by this VPI-based approach yields a dataspace with a significantly higher utility than a wide range of other ordering strategies. Finally, we outline the design of Roomba, a system that utilizes this decision-theoretic framework to guide a dataspace in soliciting user feedback in a pay-as-you-go manner. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Our work addresses the problem of information overload in the spatial domain. Information overload can confuse and overwhelm users by providing too much detail, often complicating simple interaction tasks. Knowing users' interests allows the system to alleviate information overload, and therefore facilitate interaction, by tailoring the information displayed at the interface to individual user preferences. Spatial data (e.g. topographic maps) are rich in content and typically require explicit actions such as zooming and panning to view their extent. This paper presents preliminary results which show that user's spatial interests can viably be ascertained by monitoring mouse movements and clicks as spatial implicit interest indicators. An interest modelling algorithm analyses this interaction information to produce user interest models, reflecting each user's latest interests as they change over time. These models can be used for the personalisation of user datasets and interfaces, balancing the display content with the relevance of the available information in the system to the user and his context.},

abstract={Digital gaming is receiving more and more attention in the academic research. Games are studied in different situations with numerous methods, but little is known how the playing situation affects the user experience (UX) in games. In addition, it is hard to understand and study the psychology of UX in games. The aim of this study is to compare the UX in playing the first-person shooter Halo in a laboratory and at home. Multidimensional UX is profiled according to a psychological framework measuring the level of involvement sense of presence and flow in a between-subjects design. Statistically the structure of the framework is grounded on a large and heterogeneous game-player dataset (n=2182). The results showed that the profile of the sense of presence in the laboratory included higher levels of attention and arousal as compared to that of the natural environment. This finding was independent from any of the measured background variables. Other differences between the two situations were more related to the participants' background. For example, players at home were more involved in the game and they felt higher level of competence. There were no strong emotional differences between the two situations. In the end, the terminology used to explain experiential phenomena is discussed. The situational impact on UX in games should be considered when laboratory studies are designed, participants are recruited and results are compared across the gaming situations. © 2008 IADIS.},

abstract={Application of clustering approaches in cross-disciplinary domains has necessitated the identification of new methods capable of simultaneous examination of multiple conflicting metrics during optimization. In this work, we propose a novel multi-objective clustering approach based on the concepts of microeconomic theory. In a multi-step, normal form game theoretic setup, each randomly initialized cluster is categorized as either a player or a resource in the game. The players in the game compete against each other for allocation of resources, and try to maximize their own utilities. The utility for a strategy of a player is a function of the clustering objectives. A Nash equilibrium based methodology is used to identify a solution that is socially fair. The algorithm is tested on real as well as artificially synthesized spatial data sets to evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm, and the quantitative measure of the quality of clusters in terms of fairness. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Over the past four decades, state investment tax incentives have proliferated. This emergence of state investment tax credits (ITC) and other investment tax incentives raises two important questions: 1) Are these tax incentives effective in achieving their stated objective, to increase investment within the state?; 2) To the extent these incentives raise investment within the state, how much of this increase is due to investment drawn away from other states? To begin to answer these questions, we construct a detailed panel dataset for 48 states for 20+ years. The dataset contains series on output and capital, their relative prices, and establishment counts. The effects of tax variables on capital formation and establishments are measured by the Jorgensonian user cost of capital that depends in a nonlinear manner on federal and state tax variables. Cross-jurisdictional differences in state investment tax credits and state corporate tax rates entering the user cost, combined with a panel that is long in the time dimension, are key to identifying the effectiveness of state investment incentives. Two models are estimated. The Capital Demand Model is motivated by the first-order condition for a profit-maximizing firm and relates at the state level the capital/output ratio to the relative user cost of capital. The Twin-Counties Model exploits both the spatial breaks ("discontinuities") in tax policy at state borders and our panel dataset to relate at the county level the relative user cost to the location of manufacturing establishments. Using the Capital Demand Model, we find that own-state capital formation is substantially increased by tax-induced reductions in the own-state price of capital and, more interestingly, substantially decreased by tax-induced reductions in the price of capital in competitive-states. Similarly, using our Twin-Counties Model, we find that county manufacturing establishment counts around state borders are higher on the side of the border with the lower price of capital, but the difference is economically small, suggesting that establishments are much less mobile than overall capital. Extensions of the Capital Demand Model also reveal that state capital tax policy appears to be a zero-sum game among the states in that an equiproportionate increase in own-state and competitive-states user costs tends to have no effect on own-state capital formation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis included removal of trend and mean, interpolation and re-sampling of the data to provide an equi-spaced time basis, test for normal distribution of datasets, power spectral estimation, estimation of the parameters of 1st and 2nd order autocorrelation models and estimation of the same parameters on the residuals following subtraction of the 1st or 2nd order models. All power spectra showed the highest power at the lowest frequencies; correspondingly the 1st order autocorrelation coefficients were significant at the 5% level except for TE (p = 0.12). The 2nd order coefficients were non-significant for all series. The 1st order autocorrelation coefficients of the residuals (after subtraction of the 1st order autocorrelation component) were all non-significant. With 1st order autocorrelation coefficients averaging between .12 and .37 the non-random part of the variation explained by the 1st order autocorrelation structure is between 1.4% and 13.7% and independent of stimulation of breathing by thermal or mental stimuli. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={Online social networking sites such as Facebook and MySpace have become increasingly popular, with close to 500 million users as of August 2008. The introduction of the Facebook Developer Platform and OpenSocial allows thirdparty developers to launch their own applications for the existing massive user base. The viral growth of these social applications can potentially influence how content is produced and consumed in the future Internet. To gain a better understanding, we conducted a largescale measurement study of the usage characteristics of online social network based applications. In particular, we developed and launched three Facebook applications, which have achieved a, combined subscription base of over 8 million users. Using the rich dataset gathered through these applications, we analyze the aggregate workload characteristics (including temporal and geographical distributions) as well as the structure of user interactions. We explore the existence of 'communities', with high degree of interaction within a community and limited interaction outside the community. We find that a small fraction of users account for the majority of activity within the context of our Facebook applications and a small number of applications account for the majority of users on Facebook. Furthermore, user response times for Facebook applications are independent of source/destination user locality. We also investigate distinguishing characteristics of social gaming applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study analyzing user activities on online social applications. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract={In this work we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel eye tracker for context-awareness and mobile HCI applications. In contrast to common systems using video cameras, this compact device relies on Electrooculography (EOG). It consists of goggles with dry electrodes integrated into the frame and a small pocket-worn component with a DSP for real-time EOG signal processing. The device is intended for wearable and standalone use: It can store data locally for long-term recordings or stream processed EOG signals to a remote device over Bluetooth. We describe how eye gestures can be efficiently recognised from EOG signals for HCI purposes. In an experiment conducted with 11 subjects playing a computer game we show that 8 eye gestures of varying complexity can be continuously recognised with equal performance to a state-of-the-art video-based system. Physical activity leads to artefacts in the EOG signal. We describe how these artefacts can be removed using an adaptive filtering scheme and characterise this approach on a 5-subject dataset. In addition to explicit eye movements for HCI, we discuss how the analysis of unconscious eye movements may eventually allow to deduce information on user activity and context not available with current sensing modalities.

abstract={We present a live demo of the Computer Expression Recognition Toolbox (CERT) developed at University of California, San Diego. CERT measures facial expressions in real-time, and codes them with respect to expressions of basic emotion, as well as over 20 facial actions from the Facial Action Coding System (Ekman & Friesen, 1978). Head pose (yaw, pitch, and roll) is also detected using an algorithm presented at this conference (Whitehill & Movellan, 2008). A sample output is shown in Figure 1. This system was employed in some of the earliest experiments in which spontaneous behavior was analyzed with automated expression recognition to extract new information about facial expression that was previously unknown (Bartlett et al., 2008). These experiments addressed automated discrimination of posed from genuine expressions of pain, and automated detection of driver drowsiness. The analysis revealed information about facial behavior during these conditions that were previously unknown, including the coupling of movements. Automated classifiers were able to differentiate real from fake pain significantly better than naïve human subjects, and to detect driver drowsiness above 98% accuracy. Another experiment showed that facial expression was able to predict perceived difficulty of a video lecture and preferred presentation speed (Whitehill et al., 2008). CERT is also being employed in a project to give feedback on facial expression production to children with autism. A prototype game, called SmileMaze, requires the player to produce a smile to enable a character to pass though doors and obtain rewards (Tanaka et al., 2008). Statistical pattern recognition on large quantities of video data can reveal emergent behavioral patterns that previously would have required hundreds of coding hours by human experts, and would be unattainable by the nonexpert. Moreover, automated facial expression analysis will enable investigations into facial expression dynamics that were previously intractable by human coding because of the time required to code intensity changes. The technical approach to CERT is a texture-based discriminative approach. Such approaches have proven highly robust and fast for face detection and tracking (e.g. Viola & Jones, 2001). Face and detection and detection of internal facial features is first performed on each frame using boosting techniques in a generative framework (Fasel et al.) extending work by Viola and Jones (2001). Enhancements to Viola and Jones include employing Gentleboost instead of AdaBoost, smart feature search, and a novel cascade training procedure, combined in a generative framework. The automatically located faces are then rescaled to 96×96 pixels. The typical distance between the centers of the eyes is roughly 48 pixels. Faces are then aligned using a fast least squares fit on the detected features, and then passed through a bank of Gabor filters 8 orientations and 9 spatial frequencies (2:32 pixels per cycle at 1/2 octave steps). Output magnitudes were then normalized and passed to the facial action classifiers. Facial action detectors were then developed by training separate support vector machines to detect the presence or absence of each facial action. The training set consisted of over 8000 images from both posed and spontaneous expressions, which were coded for facial actions from the Facial Action Coding System. The datasets were the Cohn-Kanade DFAT-504 dataset (Kanade, Cohn & Tian, 2000); The Ekman, Hager dataset of directed facial actions (Bartlett et al., 1999); A subset of 50 videos from 20 subjects from the MMI database (Pantic et al., 2005); and three spontaneous expression datasets collected by Mark Frank D005, D006, D007 (Bartlett et. al. 2006). Performances on a benchmark datasets (Cohn-Kanade) show state of the art performance for both recognition of basic emotions (98% correct detection for 1 vs all, and 93% correct for 7 alternative forced choice), and for recognizing facial actions from the Facial Action Coding System (mean.93 area under the ROC over 8 facial actions, equivalent to percent correct on a 2-alernative forced choice). More information about the facial expression detection system can be found in Bartlett et al., 2006. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Declarative Modelling is an early-phase design technique allowing the user to describe an object or an environment in abstract terms, closer to human intuition. The geometric solutions automatically yielded for such a description are evaluated by the user and may be subsequently used for the construction of a computational model of his/her preferences. Due to the physical limitations of the human evaluator, and the large number of the representations produced, only a subset of the latter are actually evaluated by the user and eventually a small number of them are approved, leading to imbalanced datasets in regard to the learning mechanism invoked. In the current work we discuss and assess the capability of a mechanism adopted for user modelling in a declarative design environment to handle this imbalance. The experimental results in this context indicate considerable efficiency in the prediction for the under-represented class. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Go is an ancient board game that poses unique opportunities and challenges for artificial intelligence. Currently, there are no computer Go programs that can play at the level of a good human player. However, the emergence of large repositories of games is opening the door for new machine learning approaches to address this challenge. Here we develop a machine learning approach to Go, and related board games, focusing primarily on the problem of learning a good evaluation function in a scalable way. Scalability is essential at multiple levels, from the library of local tactical patterns, to the integration of patterns across the board, to the size of the board itself. The system we propose is capable of automatically learning the propensity of local patterns from a library of games. Propensity and other local tactical information are fed into recursive neural networks, derived from a probabilistic Bayesian network architecture. The recursive neural networks in turn integrate local information across the board in all four cardinal directions and produce local outputs that represent local territory ownership probabilities. The aggregation of these probabilities provides an effective strategic evaluation function that is an estimate of the expected area at the end, or at various other stages, of the game. Local area targets for training can be derived from datasets of games played by human players. In this approach, while requiring a learning time proportional to N4, skills learned on a board of size N2 can easily be transferred to boards of other sizes. A system trained using only 9×9 amateur game data performs surprisingly well on a test set derived from 19×19 professional game data. Possible directions for further improvements are briefly discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={As carbon becomes a valuable commodity traded in markets for greenhouse-gas emissions, there will be incentives to adopt land uses that capture carbon payments as well as produce other marketable outputs, including biofuels. These production systems may be more sustainable than many of those in current use, but there is also the risk that the growing demand for biofuels will cause land degradation, deforestation and food scarcity. The land-use patterns that arise as a result of carbon markets will largely depend on the 'rules of the game', which will be determined by governments and international agencies. This paper addresses these issues by reviewing the literature on the potential for terrestrial carbon pools to contribute to mitigating climate change. The review covers studies from forestry, ecology, economics, agriculture and other disciplines, reflecting the complexity of the issues and the range of research priorities that will need to be addressed in the next few decades. There is strong evidence that the potential for land-use systems to contribute to climate mitigation efforts is significant, but for this to occur it will be necessary that landholders receive incentives to change their current land uses. These incentives are linked to scientific, institutional and economic factors. An essential component will be the development of markets that allow the trade of emission reductions from both the energy sector and the land-use change and forestry (LUCF) sector. Technical factors that will contribute to success include: creation and analysis of remote-sensing and socio-economic datasets to estimate credible baselines; development of simple and inexpensive techniques for measuring soil carbon; and development of agreed standards that relate land-use and biophysical characteristics of a site to carbon content. Much research is being done to address these factors, and monitoring and reporting systems for LUCF activities are operational under the Kyoto Protocol, but obstacles remain for widespread implementation. There is a window of opportunity for projects to be developed that restore degraded croplands, avoid deforestation and encourage reforestation. This opportunity has a limited life span that depends on the duration of the transition period to low-carbon energy technologies that will ultimately carry the burden of climate change mitigation. © CAB International 2008.},

Existing methods such as collaborative filtering or multitask learning, however, have a limitation that they cannot readily incorporate a situation where individual tasks are required to model a complex dependency structure among the task-related variables, such as one by Bayesian networks. Motivated by this issue, we propose a general approach for collaboration which can be applied to Bayesian networks, based on a simple use of Bayesian principle.

A critical reappraisal of his approach is made in which the conceptual and methodological limits to the empirical testing are highlighted.

abstract={This paper presents a novel framework of error-correcting output coding (ECOC) addressing the problem of multi-class classification. By weighting the output space of each base classifier which is trained independently, the distance function of decoding is adapted so that the samples are more discriminative. A criterion generated over the Extended Pair Samples (EPS) is proposed to train the weights of output space. We first conduct empirical studies on UCI datasets to verify the presented framework with four frequently used coding matrixes and then apply it in RoboCup domain to enhance the performance of agent control. Color-based image segmentation is also tested in this paper. Experimental results show that our supervised learned decoding scheme improves the accuracy of classification significantly and betters the ball control of agents in a soccer game after learning from experience. Some properties still hold in the new framework: any classifier, as well as distance function, is still applicable. Besides, it is allowed in the new framework to implement nonlinear decoding processes using kernel tricks. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Probably the single most important concern of the biotechnology industry is to improve existing biotechnology applications and tools due to the exponential increase in the size of the datasets. Improving application specific performance, pertaining to sudden and dynamic changes in the execution environment has been a widely researched problem. This research was undertaken to find application specific performance problems in the field of applied Bioinformatics. We specifically narrow down on an important everyday bioinformatics application namely Blast, used commonly by biologists for everyday research. A detailed literature study was undertaken to observe the gaps specific to the applications performance subjected to different quality of service constraints and system specific parameters under the confluence of a dynamic mini grid test bed. A number of gaps were identified; throughput in terms of latency (message passing); scalability (load balancing) and application performance (reliability) needs to be addressed. An experimental mini grid test bed was implemented to simulate various conditions and to test the proposed hypotheses. The implemented architecture utilizes game theoretic optimization and agent based team formation (Coalition) algorithms to improve upon scalability with respect to team formation. Due to the dynamic nature of distributed systems (as discussed in previous works) all interactions are made local within a team transparently. This paper is a proof of concept of an experimental mini-Grid test-bed aimed at improving performances of bioinformatics Blast application in terms of scalability and stability. Experimental results and detailed literature on current approaches are explored to conduct a set of generic experiments to validate our claims. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Social tagging systems have been largely adopted by users as useful and powerful tools to organize, browse and share interested resources on the web. All the tags used and resources collected by a user constitute the user's personal tag space, which contains valuable information that can be used for building and enhancing the user model. In this paper, we propose an approach to mine user profile from one's personal tag space. The proposed approach is based on the theory of concept lattices, which provides a powerful, well-founded, and computationally-tractable framework to model one's personal tag space in which tags and collocated resources are represented and to compute such a transformation. We dejine several properties for each concept generated to evaluate the degree of such concept to depict the user's interest, and then a novel algorithm is introduced to construct a hierarchical user profile from the built lattice. Experiments are carried out on the dataset collected from delicious and a detailed real-life case study is presented. Results show that the hierarchical user profile can describe the target user's interests well enough, as well as organizing and browsing the tags and collocated resources effectively. Several research issues and technical details are discussed to further improve tag-based user profile for personalized services in the end. © 2008 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: The exponential growth of available biological data has caused bioinformatics to be rapidly moving towards a data-intensive, computational science. As a result, the computational power needed by bioinformatics applications is growing exponentially as well. The recent emergence of accelerator technologies has made it possible to achieve an excellent improvement in execution time for many bioinformatics applications, compared to current general-purpose platforms. In this paper, we demonstrate how the PlayStation® 3, powered by the Cell Broadband Engine, can be used as a computational platform to accelerate the Smith-Waterman algorithm. Results: For large datasets, our implementation on the PlayStation® 3 provides a significant improvement in running time compared to other implementations such as SSEARCH, Striped Smith-Waterman and CUDA. Our implementation achieves a peak performance of up to 3,646 MCUPS. Conclusion: The results from our experiments demonstrate that the PlayStation® 3 console can be used as an efficient low cost computational platform for high performance sequence alignment applications. © 2008 Wirawan et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={A generic method to estimate the flow rate (number of particles passing per unit of time) of free falling granular particles in a tube is presented. This principle could be applied in pneumatic planters, fertiliser distribution, yield monitoring of grains and fruits and various industrial applications. The flow of particles in a tube was observed as an intermittent succession of clumps of particles separated by spacings among them. Since the clumping effect prohibits counting individual particles, the hypothesis was that the flow constitutes a random arrival process in time. In other words, the process of particle arrivals at the sensor was assumed equivalent to classical Poisson driven arrival processes from queueing theory, such as telephone calls arriving independently at a helpdesk. The assumption of a Poisson process allows for simple flow rate estimation, since according to theory, the flow density of such a process is equal to the reciprocal value of the mean of the spacing time intervals, which can be measured. An optical single interruption plane sensor was used to measure the time intervals during which clumps and spacings pass. This sensor suffers from inherent errors such as defocus and uncertain optical switching behaviour. Therefore, the sensor was characterised by equalising measured quantities with their theoretical equivalents. This implies that the estimated mean flow rate must be equal to the theoretical mean flow rate, however, the variability and extreme values among experiments indicate the usefulness and appropriateness of the method. To test the validity of the Poisson model assumption, 30 experiments were conducted in which 4000, 4.5 mm identical spherical particles were dropped from a funnel into a fall tube. To assess the performance of the method, it is not possible to compare measured flow rates with reference counterparts, since there are none. However, the initial number of particles per experiment is known and, therefore, this number was estimated using measurements. After characterisation, the original number of 4000 particles per experiment was estimated at 4000 with a standard deviation of 44 (1.1% coefficient of variation) among 30 datasets. The extreme values of the estimations were 4092 (+2.3% error) and 3930 (-1.8% error), respectively.},

abstract={Hyperlinks among webpages are very important information and are widely used for webpage clustering and webpage ranking. With the explosive growth in the number of webpages available online, the exploration of hyperlinks among webpages becomes a very challenging problem. Information visualization provides an effective way of visualizing hyperlinks and can help users gain insights into the relationships of webpages. In this paper, we present some novel computer graphics techniques to visualize the hyperlinks among webpages. We propose a visual encoding scheme for five dimensional hyperlinks data and two constrained 3D layout techniques for incoming and outgoing links of a single webpage. To reveal the hierarchical structure of webpages as well as the hyperlinks information, we extend the treemap representation. Our representations are visually appealing and can effectively reveal linkage patterns among webpages. Experimental results and a user study demonstrate the effectiveness of our system.

abstract={Achieving intuitive control of animated surface deformation while observing a specific style is an important but challenging task in computer graphics. Solutions to this task can find many applications in data-driven skin animation, computer puppetry, and computer games. In this paper, we present an intuitive and powerful animation interface to simultaneously control the deformation of a large number of local regions on a deformable surface with a minimal number of control points. Our method learns suitable deformation subspaces from training examples, and generate new deformations on the fly according to the movements of the control points. Our contributions include a novel deformation regression method based on kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) and a Poisson-based translation solving technique for easy and fast deformation control based on examples. Our run-time algorithm can be implemented on GPUs and can achieve a few hundred frames per second even for large datasets with hundreds of training examples. © 2008 ACM.},

abstract={Automatic structuring is one means to ease access to document collections, be it for organization or for exploration. Of even greater help would be a presentation that adapts to the user's way of structuring and thus is intuitively understandable. We extend an existing user-adaptive prototype system that is based on a growing self-organizing map and that learns a feature weighting scheme from a user's interaction with the system resulting in a personalized similarity measure. The proposed approach for adapting the feature weights targets certain problems of previously used heuristics. The revised adaptation method is based on quadratic optimization and thus we are able to pose certain contraints on the derived weighting scheme. Moreover, thus it is guaranteed that an optimal weighting scheme is found if one exists. The proposed approach is evaluated by simulating user interaction with the system on two text datasets: one artificial data set that is used to analyze the performance for different user types and a real world data set - a subset of the banksearch dataset - containing additional class information. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The "choking game" is defined as self-strangulation or strangulation by another person with the hands or a noose to achieve a brief euphoric state caused by cerebral hypoxia. Participants in this activity typically are youths (Andrew & Fallon, 2007). Serious neurologic injury or death can result from engaging in this activity. Recent news media reports have described numerous deaths among youths attributed to the choking game. Because no traditional public health dataset collects data on this practice, CDC used news media reports to estimate the incidence of deaths from the choking game. This report describes the results of that analysis, which identified 82 probable choking-game deaths among youths aged 6-19 years during 1995-2007. Seventy-one (86.6%) of the decedents were male, and the mean age was 13.3 years. Parents, educators, and health-care providers should become familiar with warning signs that youths are playing the choking game (Urkin & Merrick, 2006). Impact of industry: By learning about the risk factors for and warning signs of the choking game, parents, educators, and health-care providers may be able to identify youth at risk for playing the game and prevent future deaths.},

abstract={The aim of the study was to analyze whether young male volleyballers' age, body build and performance could be simultaneously assessed in a sport-anthropological classification of height and weight. For this purpose, 13 anthropometric variables of 67 players from eight teams participating in Estonian championships for Class C (up to 16-year-olds) were measured. The performance of 64 of them was recorded during a tournament consisting of 28 games using the original computer program Game. Both datasets were systematized on the basis of the players' individual height and weight into 5 SD classes: (1) small weight and small height, (2) medium weight and medium height, (3) big weight and big height, (4) pycnomorphs - big weight and small height, and (5) leptomorphs - small weight and big height. The players' average age was 14.51, which did not significantly differ between classes 2, 3, 4 and 5. The smallest boys (class 1) were significantly younger (χ̄ = 13.77). Gradual increase in weight and height was accompanied by essential increase in all the other measurements. The classes of pycnics and leptosomes displayed differences characteristic of these well-known somatotypes. The players' performance in the game also differed systematically in body build classes. The total number of serves, receptions, spikes and blocks as well as the number of successful serves, spikes and blocks increased gradually from classes 1-3 and was essentially greater in leptomorphs than in pycnomorphs. The greatest number of points for their teams was scored by leptomorphs (37.53%) and players of the big class (30.48%) and the smallest number by the class of small boys (6.70%).},

abstract={Under political uncertainty, legislative coalitions have incentives to insulate policy from future coalitions. While there is evidence of legislators' use of agency design to insulate the bureaucracy from elected officials, little is known about the ultimate consequences of such design choices on the policy participation of interest groups. How such design choices affect group access is important because of the centrality of groups in providing both bureaucratic accountability and information for policy development. Accordingly, we examine the consequences of the so-called "insulation game" on group access to the bureaucracy. We develop an information exchange theory that portrays the impact of agency design choices on group-reported access as a function of the level of design-induced political insulation and the quality of the information offered by a given group. We test our theory with two original datasets that include design parameters of US state environmental agencies and survey data measuring reported agency access by state-level interest groups. Our results suggest that insulating agencies via design does lead to lower reported access to regulators by interest groups, but only among those groups who supply less valuable information. © The Author 2007.

abstract={Motivation: Identification of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) plays an important role in deciphering the mechanisms of gene regulation. Recently, GAME, a Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based approach with iterative post-processing, has shown superior performance in TFBS identification. However, the basic GA in GAME is not elaborately designed, and may be trapped in local optima in real problems. The feature operators are only applied in the post-processing, but the final performance heavily depends on the GA output. Hence, both effectiveness and efficiency of the overall algorithm can be improved by introducing more advanced representations and novel operators in the GA, as well as designing the post-processing in an adaptive way. Results: We propose a novel framework GALF-P, consisting of Genetic Algorithm with Local Filtering (GALF) and adaptive post-processing techniques (-P), to achieve both effectiveness and efficiency for TFBS identification. GALF combines the position-led and consensus-led representations used separately in current GAs and employs a novel local filtering operator to get rid of false positives within an individual efficiently during the evolutionary process in the GA. Pre-selection is used to maintain diversity and avoid local optima. Post-processing with adaptive adding and removing is developed to handle general cases with arbitrary numbers of instances per sequence. GALF-P shows superior performance to GAME, MEME, BioProspector and BioOptimizer on synthetic datasets with difficult scenarios and real test datasets. GALF-P is also more robust and reliable when further compared with GAME, the current state-of-the-art approach. © The Author 2007. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

Visual representation of logged game player data can provide insight in order to discover patterns and behavior that would otherwise be hidden. In this paper, we explored the use of visual data mining and automated data processing to process the logged player data and present the results of finding five unique phenomena in our dataset of 3079 players. These phenomena include pirouettes, flusters, jumpers, learning, and emergent behavior. Using the visual data mining process, we can find occurrences of such behavioral patterns in order to understand player behavior and improve the interactive experience. © 2008 The University of Wolverhampton.},

abstract={Traditional means of communication, education and training, and research have been dramatically transformed with the advent of computerized medicine, and no other medical specialty has been more greatly affected than radiology. Of the myriad of newer computer applications currently available, computer gaming stands out for its unique potential to enhance end-user performance and job satisfaction. Research in other disciplines has demonstrated computer gaming to offer the potential for enhanced decision making, resource management, visual acuity, memory, and motor skills. Within medical imaging, video gaming provides a novel means to enhance radiologist and technologist performance and visual perception by increasing attentional capacity, visual field of view, and visual-motor coordination. These enhancements take on heightened importance with the increasing size and complexity of three-dimensional imaging datasets. Although these operational gains are important in themselves, psychologic gains intrinsic to video gaming offer the potential to reduce stress and improve job satisfaction by creating a fun and engaging means of spirited competition. By creating customized gaming programs and rewards systems, video game applications can be customized to the skill levels and preferences of individual users, thereby creating a comprehensive means to improve individual and collective job performance. © 2008 American College of Radiology.},

The ratio of missing values can be extremely high, even as much as 98%. In this context the following question arises naturally -"Can we apply the known missing value analysis procedures in this context". We present the experimental setup and experimental results of our approach. We also discuss known user modeling techniques together with proposed missing value management procedures.

abstract={Rough set feature selection (RSFS) can be used to improve classifier performance. RSFS removes redundant attributes whilst keeping important ones that preserve the classification power of the original dataset. The feature subsets selected by RSFS are termed reducts. The intersection of all reducts is termed the core. As RSFS works on discrete attributes only, for real-valued datasets discretization of the real attributes is performed before RSFS. The core size of the discretized datasets is determined by the discretization process. Previous work has shown that the core size of the discretized dataset critically affects the performance of RSFS. This paper proposes a type of discretization termed core-generating approximate minimum entropy discretization (C-GAME) which selects a set of minimum entropy cuts capable of generating discrete data with nonempty cores. The paper defines C-GAME and then models it as a constraint satisfaction optimization problem which is solved using the branch and bound algorithm. Experiments have been performed on 2 datasets from the UCI database to investigate the performance of C-GAME as a pre-processing step for RSFS. Results show that, for these datasets, C-GAME outperforms both the recursive minimal entropy partition discretization method (RMEP) and the original decision trees without feature selection. © 2007 IEEE.},

abstract={Go is an ancient board game that poses unique opportunities and challenges for AI and machine learning. Here we develop a machine learning approach to Go, and related board games, focusing primarily on the problem of learning a good evaluation function in a scalable way. Scalability is essential at multiple levels, from the library of local tactical patterns, to the integration of patterns across the board, to the size of the board itself. The system we propose is capable of automatically learning the propensity of local patterns from a library of games. Propensity and other local tactical information are fed into a recursive neural network, derived from a Bayesian network architecture. The network integrates local information across the board and produces local outputs that represent local territory ownership probabilities. The aggregation of these probabilities provides an effective strategic evaluation function that is an estimate of the expected area at the end (or at other stages) of the game. Local area targets for training can be derived from datasets of human games. A system trained using only 9 × 9 amateur game data performs surprisingly well on a test set derived from 19 × 19 professional game data. Possible directions for further improvements are briefly discussed.},

abstract={In this paper we present a flexible architecture for both desktop and mobile systems designed to measure users' implicit levels of interest in spatial information, based on their mouse movements. Users interact with spatial objects through a GIS interface. Our system monitors their actions and compares the spatial location of their mouse interactions during a session to the underlying spatial information displayed to the user. By making this comparison we implicitly determine a user's interests and disinterests. This information can be used to build up a user profile on a session by session basis, allowing the system to personalise future datasets to present to the user based on his profile, reducing information overload, and increasing the ratio of user-relevant content. The case study for our system concerns archaeological information for burial tombs in the ancient city of Tarquinia.},

abstract={We demonstrate a binary classification problem in which standard supervised learning algorithms such as linear and kernel SVM, naive Bayes, ridge regression, k-nearest neighbors, shrunken centroid, multilayer perceptron and decision trees perform in an unusual way. On certain data sets they classify a randomly sampled training subset nearly perfectly, but systematically perform worse than random guessing on cases unseen in training. We demonstrate this phenomenon in classification of a natural data set of cancer genomics microarrays using crossvalidation test. Additionally, we generate a range of synthetic datasets, the outcomes of 0-sum games, for which we analyse this phenomenon in the i.i.d. setting. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate a remedy that yields promising results for classifying such data as well as normal datasets. We simply transform the classifier scores by an additional 1-dimensional linear transformation developed, for instance, to maximize classification accuracy of the outputs of an internal cross-validation on the training set.

Since an exact Bayesian treatment is intractable, several techniques for approximate inference have been proposed in the literature. In this paper we compare several variants of expectation propagation (EP). EP generalizes assumed density filtering (ADF) by iteratively improving the approximations that are made in the filtering step of ADF. Furthermore, we distinguish between two variants of EP: EP-Correlated, which takes into account the correlations between the strengths of the players and EP-Independent, which ignores those correlations. We evaluate the different approaches on a large tennis dataset to find that EP does significantly better than ADF (iterative improvement indeed helps) and EP-Correlated does significantly better than EP-Independent (correlations do matter). © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.},

abstract={The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADF&G) has been conducting a habitat-based stock assessment of yellow-eye rockfish (Sebastes niberrimus) in the eastern Gutf of Alaska since 1989. Yelloweye rockfish occur in rugged rocky terrain on the continental shelf, and are an important commercial species taken in directed, and by-catch bottom-long-line fisheries. The biomass of yelloweye rockfish is derived as the product of density, average weight, and area of habitat. Density is based on line-transect surveys conducted from an occupied submersible. Area estimates of yelloweye habitat are based on the probable distribution of rocky habitat inshore of the 200 m bathymetric contour. Information used to identify rocky habitat include sidescan and multibeam sonar data (ground-truthed using direct observation from the submersible) and commercial logbook data from the directed fishery. In areas with multibeam or sidescan sonar data, the area of rockfish habitat is delineated based on defined substrate types within the mapped area. For areas without these geophysical datasets, position data from commercial fishery logbooks is used. In areas with both logbook and geophysical data, areas of habitat generally overlap but are not identical. Logbook data is mandatory, but self-reported, and may not always be accurate. Geophysical surveys reveal the extent of all rocky habitats, while fishermen target areas of prime habitat. Limiting of surveys to prime habitat may result in inaccurate stock assessments because density may remain stable in the prime habitat, while declining in surrounding habitats. By assessing fish densities in all rockfish habitats, as delineated by geophysical surveys, a better indicator of stock condition is possible. Further unlike logbook data, multibeam data allows us to clearly define boundaries of prime habitats, relevant to management decisions regarding marine reserves or to definition of management units.},

abstract={Addressing landscape-level threats to stream fishes such as habitat and hydrological alterations requires adequate watershed-level species inventories. Where watershed-level ichthyofaunal surveys are prohibitively expensive, existing (historical) data sources may provide an option for compiling species lists. However, it is critical that managers consider potential biases or limitations of species lists compiled from existing data. Here we assess the suitability of species lists compiled from existing data sources for making watershed-level fish management and conservation decisions. For nine Great Lakes watersheds, we developed existing species lists by compiling all available federal and state agency and museum fish survey data. We then compared the size and species composition of existing species lists to current species lists compiled from intensive field surveys, conducted in 2002, of the same watersheds. Species lists compiled from commonly available existing data sources, such as state and federal agency and museum data, missed many species detected during our 2002 field surveys. In most watersheds, more than 10 species were missed (range 5-21) on existing lists. Sampling over multiple years and seasons increased the size of both current (field) and existing species lists. Existing species lists compiled from surveys conducted over multiple years and seasons included an average of 15 species not captured during the 2002 field surveys. However, such multiyear existing datasets are rare and not available for many watersheds. In addition, species lists compiled from older existing surveys (e.g., before 1984) did not accurately represent current species composition of the watersheds and our results indicate several apparent misidentifications or errors on these lists. Lastly, while most game species were detected on existing lists, migratory species and recently introduced species were commonly missed on these lists. We conclude with recommendations for using existing data for watershed-level stream fish management and conservation decisions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

abstract={Relationship Web takes us from "which document" could have information I need to "what's in the resources" that gives me the insight and knowledge I need for decision making. Dr. Vannevar Bush outlined his vision for Memex in a 1945 Atlantic Monthly article [1]. Describing how the human brain navigates an information space in what he called trailblazing, Dr. Bush said, "It operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts, in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of the brain." Now that we can label content to associate semantics (meaning) to data and build information processing in which relationships rather than keywords and entities play the central role, the possibility of realizing the Memex vision seems tantalizingly close. Although through much of the recent past attention has been on search, finding a document is seldom the end goal of a human activity. Aligned with the Memex vision, human need for information is related to a desire and need for information processing that goes well beyond delivering a list of documents that matches the keywords or even the implied intent. Human information seeking is likely to be driven by more demanding activities such as interaction and entertainment, finding associations and answers, performing analysis, gaining insights, or making decisions. The Memex vision provides an interesting paradigm for supporting these objectives. Changing the computing paradigm to one that focuses on relationships is the key to realizing the Memex vision. We term our realization of Memex Relationship Web. In past work we observed the changing focus from documents to entities to relationships. We also investigated a broad variety of issues related to modeling, validating, discovering, and exploiting the many types of relationships between entities in content [2]. The first result of these efforts was the concept of Metadata Reference Links (MREFs), which proposed associating semantic metadata with hypertext links [3]. MREF faced several limitations, but recent significant advances resulting from research, standards, and technology development associated with Semantic Web provide building blocks for realizing the Relationship Web. We outline below some recent relationship-centric research to which we have had the opportunity to contribute, at the same time acknowledging extensive work in each area by many researchers and practitioners. Ontology Development: We now have languages, techniques, methodologies, technologies, and tools for creating and managing ontologies. In domains such as biomedicine, many open-source, extensible, and reusable ontologies have been created and are in use, while in other domains we know how to build ontologies as needed. Equally important, we understanding that agreement (ontological commitment) is critical to interoperability and integration. We can represent agreements that range from "little semantics" to "deep semantics" and that span domain vocabularies, nomenclatures, folkonomies, taxonomies, classifications, and ontologies, each of which provides different capabilities to improve search, integration, and analysis of information. Semantic Metadata Extraction and Annotation: It is now possible to extract focused (persons, addresses, events, etc.) or domain-specific metadata from unstructured, semistructured, and structured data, including enterprise and scientific data, open Web and deep Web data, in a scalable way [4]. In addition to entities, it is also possible to extract Simple Relationships and Complex Relationships [5]. Imagine representing much of the information in large scientific repositories such as PubMed in RDF that models relationships as first class objects. This is now in the process of being realized! Semantic enrichment: Enterprise and scientific databases, along with other deep Web content, store a lot of the world"s information. What if these databases were represented in RDF and, in the process, additional implicit or indirectly represented semantic information were explicitly represented as named relationships? This is indeed being done, making the original data even more valuable, as exemplified by mapping NCBI"s Entrez Gene into an RDF dataset [6]. Modeling and representation of relationships: We now understand various types of relationships and have found way to model, represent, and compute them. An interesting dimension along which we can study relationships, including implicit and formal relationships, was introduced in [7] and recently extended with a type we call Explicit Linguistic Relationship. Representation of complex relationships such as those needed to model complex natural phenomena is also attempted [8]. Query language with support for relationships: Extending query languages with the ability to compute and rank semantic associations and complex relationships [9] is important to support powerful relationship computing. Semantic Web languages such as SPARQL can be extended with powerful operators, as seen by the addition of a path operator in SPARQ2L [10]. Emergent Relationship Web capabilities have already started to power new techniques such as semantic browsing, hypothesis-based document retrieval, and knowledge discovery over all forms of data (text, scientific data, structured data repositories and deep Web data, Web 1.0, Web 2.0 content, and so on). How does the Relationship Web relate to the Semantic Web? We see the Semantic Web as an enabler of the Relationship Web. What metadata, annotation, and labeling are to the Semantic Web, relationships of all forms (implicit, explicit, and formal) are to the Relationship Web. The primary goal of the Semantic Web has been described (by Tim Berners-Lee and many others) as integration of data or labeling of Web resources for more precise exploitation by both machines and humans. At the next level, the Relationship Web organizes Web resources for analysis that goes beyond integration to trailblazing, leading to deeper insights and better decision making. We believe the time is right for a shift from the keyword-indocument-out paradigm to something that will provide more insight into content. Leveraging the power of relationships, we have proposed the idea of a Relationship Web [11]. We have suggested how this will transform search, browsing, and retrieval of Web resources, taking the user one step closer to an automated interpretation of Web content. We anticipate that preliminary forms of a Relationship Web will take shape in specific domains such as the biomedical. We plan to create one such Relationship Web for literature from PubMed pertaining to urological diseases. As the scalability and quality of semantic metadata extraction grows, larger community-wide Relationship Webs over heterogeneous Web content will emerge. This reminds us of a dialog by Jack in Terry Gilliam" 1985 film, Brazil: "Everything's connected, all along the line. Cause and effect. That's the beauty of it. Our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.".},

abstract={The consideration of human feelings in automated music generation by intelligent music systems, albeit a compelling theme, has received very little attention. This work aims to computationally specify a system's music compositional intelligence that tightly couples with the listener's affective perceptions. First, the system induces a model that describes the relationship between feelings and musical structures. The model is learned by applying the inductive logic programming paradigm of FOIL coupled with the Diverse Density weighting metric over a dataset that was constructed using musical score fragments that were hand-labeled by the listener according to a semantic differential scale that uses bipolar affective descriptor pairs. A genetic algorithm, whose fitness function is based on the acquired model and follows basic music theory, is then used to generate variants of the original musical structures. Lastly, the system creates chordal and non-chordal tones out of the GA-obtained variants. Empirical results show that the system is 80.6% accurate at the average in classifying the affective labels of the musical structures and that it is able to automatically generate musical pieces that stimulate four kinds of impressions, namely, favorable-unfavorable, bright-dark, happy-sad, and heartrending-not heartrending.

The storyline depicted an African American teen who presented at the emergency room with burns from a workplace injury. Upon diagnosis, the teen was discovered to have hypertension and counseled to eat more fruits and vegetables and get more exercise. The evaluation was conducted using three separate datasets, one of which provided data on a sample of primetime viewers before and after the storyline aired. Results showed that the storyline affected self-reported behavior change and had modest impacts on knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Interestingly, these effects were stronger for men than for women, possibly due to men's lower knowledge levels at baseline. Issues including identification with characters and the value of even modest effects on large audiences and the implications of our findings for future evaluations of entertainment education (EE) and other health communication programs are discussed.

The determination of the market value of property with the use of such method is in fact a procedure in uncertainty. The uncertainty occurring in the property valuation process may be construed on the basis of the theory of games, using two-player zero sum games - so-called games with Nature. The solutions based on the equilibrium phenomenon may play a significant complementary role in the property valuation process, including, but not limited to that of, valuation error analysis instrument.

abstract={The work presented in this paper is result of a rapid increase of interest in game theoretical analysis and a huge growth of game related databases. It is likely that useful knowledge can be extracted from these databases. This paper argues that applying data mining algorithms together with Game Theory poses a significant potential as a new way to analyze complex engineering systems, such as strategy selection in manufacturing analysis. Recent research shows that combining data mining and Game Theory has not yet come up with reasonable solutions for the representation and structuring of the knowledge in a game. In order to examine the idea, a novel approach of fusing these two techniques has been developed in this paper and tested on real-world manufacturing datasets. The obtained results have been indicated the superiority of the proposed approach. Some fruitful directions for future research are outlined as well. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract={The Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME) reanalysis datasets are the products of four-dimensional data assimilations (4DDA) of meteorological observations made from April 1998 to October 1998. These datasets were created using the most recently updated 4DDA schemes of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) during the GAME reanalysis project (1999-2001) as well as radiosonde observations made during the intensive observation period of the GAME project (April 1998-October 1998). Two versions of reanalyses products have been released officially: Ver. 1.1 and Ver. 1.5. One of the greatest differences between the two versions is the representation of snow cover: Ver. 1.1 used climatological snow data, while Ver. 1.5 used satellite-derived snow information. Here, we describe how snow cover modifications and land surface schemes differ between the two versions and how changes in surface processes affect surface fluxes. The use of satellite-derived snow information produced a difference in surface fluxes over the Tibetan Plateau, especially for May. We also compare surface fluxes estimated by the long-term reanalysis (JRA25) product of the JMA as well as GAME reanalysis product with in situ observations by the Asian Automatic Weather Station (AWS) Network (AAN). Radiosonde observations made 4 times daily were incorporated into the atmospheric field of the 4DDA GAME reanalysis and resulted in a good correspondence between the reanalyses products and surface observations, especially for July. The use of satellite-derived snow information as a boundary condition also had improved flux results over the Tibetan Plateau in May. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

We have also introduced three different areas where collaborative modelling can be further improved. For the first phase of testing, we have created a hybrid system based on three different collaborative recommender techniques. Since this system implements multiple collaboration techniques, we decided to call this approach Combined Collaborative Recommender. Although each prediction technique can produce adequate results, we have proved that the combination of these techniques into a unified system provides a much more stable system. It should also be pointed out that these analyses were done using a very large dataset (more than 2 million ratings) providing reliable results. Results of these optimisations are presented along with pointers for further development. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract={This paper presents a new framework for shape modeling and analysis, rooted in the pattern recognition theory and based on artificial neural networks. Growing and adaptive meshes (GAMEs) are introduced: GAMEs combine the self-organizing networks which grow when require (SONGWR) algorithm and the Kohonen's self-organizing maps (SOMs) in order to build a mesh representation of a given shape and adapt it to instances of similar shapes. The modeling of a surface is seen as an unsupervised clustering problem, and tackled by using SONGWR (topology-learning phase). The point correspondence between point distribution models is granted by adapting the original model to other instances: the adaptation is seen as a classification task and performed accordingly to SOMs (topology-preserving phase). We thoroughly evaluated our method on challenging synthetic datasets, with different levels of noise and shape variations. Finally, we describe its application to the analysis of a challenging medical dataset. Our method proved to be reproducible, robust to noise, and capable of capturing real variations within and between groups of shapes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There is much active research into the design of automated bidding agents, particularly for environments that involve multiple decoupled auctions. These settings are complex partly because an agent's strategy depends on information about other bidders'interests. When bidders' valuation distributions are not known ex ante, machine learning techniques can be used to approximate them from historical data. It is a characteristic feature of auctions, however, that information about some bidders'valuations is systematically concealed. This occurs in the sense that some bidders may fail to bid at all because the asking price exceeds their valuations, and also in the sense that a high bidder may not be compelled to reveal her valuation. Ignoring these "hidden bids" can introduce bias into the estimation of valuation distributions. To overcome this problem, we propose an EM-based algorithm. We validate the algorithm experimentally using agents that react to their environments both decision-theoretically and game-theoretically, using both synthetic and real-world (eBay) datasets. We show that our approach estimates bidders' valuation distributions and the distribution over the true number of bidders significantly more accurately than more straightforward density estimation techniques. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2007.},

Consumers have come to expect the stunning imagery and the achievement of the physically impossible that CG technology enables artists and directors to provide. The demand for 3D content originated from film and games, which were the first platforms for high-profile computer-generated projects. Today, off-the-shelf 3D packages are more usable, affordable and powerful and, therefore, TV programs, networks, and advertisers can now support a visual effects budget. The massive datasets required to produce the highly detailed, realistic 3D models and scenes expected today consume more RAM than could be addressed in a 32-bit workstation, but with 64-bit workstations, memory is no longer a limiting factor. The decreasing cost of computer-generated content also has added to its increasing incidence on television.},

abstract={Collaborative and content-based filtering are the recommendation techniques most widely adopted to date. Traditional collaborative approaches compute a similarity value between the current user and each other user by taking into account their rating style, that is the set of ratings given on the same items. Based on the ratings of the most similar users, commonly referred to as neighbors, collaborative algorithms compute recommendations for the current user. The problem with this approach is that the similarity value is only computable if users have common rated items. The main contribution of this work is a possible solution to overcome this limitation. We propose a new content-collaborative hybrid recommender which computes similarities between users relying on their content-based profiles, in which user preferences are stored, instead of comparing their rating styles. In more detail, user profiles are clustered to discover current user neighbors. Content-based user profiles play a key role in the proposed hybrid recommender. Traditional keyword-based approaches to user profiling are unable to capture the semantics of user interests. A distinctive feature of our work is the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles representing user interests in a more effective way, compared to classical keyword-based profiles, due to a sense-based indexing. Semantic profiles are obtained by integrating machine learning algorithms for text categorization, namely a naïve Bayes approach and a relevance feedback method, with a word sense disambiguation strategy based exclusively on the lexical knowledge stored in the WordNet lexical database. Experiments carried out on a content-based extension of the EachMovie dataset show an improvement of the accuracy of sense-based profiles with respect to keyword-based ones, when coping with the task of classifying movies as interesting (or not) for the current user. An experimental session has been also performed in order to evaluate the proposed hybrid recommender system. The results highlight the improvement in the predictive accuracy of collaborative recommendations obtained by selecting like-minded users according to user profiles. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

An ordinary table-top display (cathode ray tube; CRT) and a near-eye display (NED) suitable for mobile gaming are compared in two different driving games. A measurement model based on a large dataset (n=2182) is applied to study psychological aspects of the game adaptation. This model integrates two constructs considered important for the game adaptation: involvement and presence. The results show that the content affected the subjective sense of presence. However, the form did not have an effect on the presence. These results indicate that NED's are capable of supporting similar adaptation to the game worlds as compared to CRT's. However, the results also weakly indicate that playing with a CRT increases the evaluations of interaction. The study shows the advantages of using multidimensional measures in studying a rich human-computer interaction. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

abstract={Actors in health organizations often participate in language games which encompass clinical, professional, and organizational subject matter. Such language games intersect within the hospital environment. This paper appraises issues of clinical risk through the re-examination of the language games which formed a part of one of Britain's worst medical disasters, namely the Bristol Royal Infirmary tragedy. A textual, grounded analysis of transcripts from the oral hearings of the 'Bristol Inquiry' (n = 74) provides the paper with a qualitative dataset, within which medical language games are analysed. The paper concludes that clinical actors work within discourses of risk (McDonald et al. 2005) that are partly constructed within, and by, participation in language games (Wittgenstein 1953). In the case of the Bristol Royal Infirmary tragedy, these games manifested contrasting interpretations of risk and safety which reflected a tainted interpretation of data by different parties at different times of the unfolding tragedy. Sensemaking of reputation appears to have played an important part in the construction of these interpretations of risk.},

We describe a brief history of the game, an overview of recent user studies, and the results of recent work on the problem of continuous, user-independent sign language recognition in classroom settings. Our database of signing samples was collected from user studies of deaf children playing a Wizard of Oz version of the game at the Atlanta Area, School for the Deaf (AASD). Our data, set is characterized by disfluencies inherent in continuous signing, varied user characteristics including clothing and skin tones, and illumination changes in the classroom. The dataset consisted of 541 phrase samples and 1,959 individual sign samples of five children signing game phrases from a 22 word vocabulary. Our recognition approach uses color histogram adaptation for robust hand segmentation and tracking. The children wear small colored gloves with wireless accelerometers mounted on the back of their wrists. The hand shape information is combined with accelerometer data and used to train hidden Markov models for recognition. We evaluated our approach by using leave-one-out validation; this technique iterates through each child, training on data from four children and testing on the remaining child's data. We achieved average word accuracies per child ranging from 91.75% to 73.73% for the user-independent models. Copyright 2006 ACM.},

abstract={The cloud microphysical properties retrieved from MODIS sub-sampling radiance dataset (MOD02SSH) over the extended GAME region are shown in this paper. The spatial distributions and temporal variations of the cloud optical thickness (τc) and effective particle radius (re), are important observation targets to understand the role of clouds in the radiation budget estimations, especially in the cloud-aerosol interaction studies, because they will have information of cloud growth process. Thus, the wide-area and relatively high-temporal observations of the cloud properties are necessary. The most passed researches that retrieved near-global distributions of the cloud properties, used the reduced data volume satellite radiance subset, such as the globally map-projected radiances dataset at the discretized degrees in latitude and longitude (e.g. 0.5 degrees) or narrow-swath (around nadir) radiance subset. In fact, these subsets reduced the computing time but unexpectedly reduced the observation samplings. In this study, we used MODIS 5-km subsampling radiance subsets (MOD02SSH) for the retrievals. The MOD02SSH conserves scene texture with moderately reduced data volume of 1/25 from original MODIS scene, so that they will be suitable for the more precise estimations of τc and re over synoptic to global scale. We retrieved τc and re from one-month MOD02SSH over the extended GAME region (60E-180E longitude and 20S to 60N latitude) in July 2004. In the obtained τc versus re scatter plots, we found interesting features that will be explained as the cloud properties under the pristine and polluted environments in the region. The non-hydrostatic spectral microphysics cloud model simulates these phenomena well. In the presentation, we will discuss about the MODIS radiance dataset for the cloud analysis, retrieval algorithm, then show the typical and interesting features appeared in observed τc-re scatter plots over the extended GAME regions.},

We propose a monotonie composite interest measure for discovering MDCOPs and a novel MDCOP mining algorithm. Analytical and experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is correct and complete. Results also show the proposed method is computationally more efficient than naïve alternatives. © 2006 IEEE.},

abstract={We upgrade the East Asia rain-gauge-based daily analysis of precipitation (Xie et al., 2006) for 1998 by utilizing daily rain-gauge precipitation data over Southeast and South Asia those are archived in GAME-T data center. This GAME enhanced version shows significant improvements in precipitation amounts in those regions where we input additional data, especially along Himalayas. We compare TRMM/PR monthly product with the GAME Enhanced version for future improvement of the orographic rainfall patterns in our rain gauge analysis. We found that TRMM/PR underestimates wet (summer) season of monsoon rainfall ∼100 mm/month. Then we validate precipitation derived from JRA-25, the ongoing Japanese 25-year reanalysis project, with the new gauge-based data set for 1998. JRA-25 reproduce precipitation pattern well in time and space, but it tends to overestimate precipitation in most of the Asian monsoon region. The simulated precipitation along Himalayas shifts southward. JRA-25 reproduces the trend of extreme events that leads a flood of the Yangtze River (July 1998), but it overestimates at extreme events. The change of the precipitation amount due to re-gridding (T106 to 2.5degree) is sometimes comparable with the difference between simulation and observation. We need to be careful about the bias caused by the regridding in extreme events. APHRODITE'S (Asian Precipitation - Highly Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of the) water resources, a project to develop a long-term rain-gauge-based daily precipitation dataset over Asia n started, and it consolidates the data-model interfaces.

abstract={Virtual 3D environments are found in a wide range of applications, like entertainment software, industrial simulations and virtual reality in medical imaging. Modern graphics hardware supports real-time rendering of highly complex virtual worlds; at the same time, extensive interaction capabilities are required to make an application useful. Graphical scenes are commonly composed of many reusable and recurring elements in a well-defined hierarchical way. In this work, a similar approach is proposed for modeling interaction capabilities. Comparable to the elements of a graphical scene, interaction mechanisms often consist of multiple components. By modeling these components as reusable objects, complex interaction mechanisms can easily be realized. The usefulness of this method is demonstrated in an application for visualizing 3D medical data, in which it has been applied to design both the 3D user interface and several interactive tools for manipulating medical datasets.},

abstract={Land surface process is of great importance in global climate change, moisture and heat exchange in the interface of the earth and atmosphere, human impacts on the environment and ecosystem, etc. Soil freeze/thaw plays an important role in cold land surface processes. In this work the diurnal freeze/thaw effects on energy partition in the context of GAME/ Tibet are studied. A sophisticated land surface model is developed, the particular aspect of which is its physical consideration of soil freeze/ thaw and vapor flux. The simultaneous water and heat transfer soil sub-model not only reflects the water flow from unfrozen zone to frozen fringe in freezing/thawing soil, but also demonstrates the change of moisture and temperature field induced by vapor flux from high temperature zone to low temperature zone, which makes the model applicable for various circumstances. The modified Picard numerical method is employed to help with the water balance and convergence of the numerical scheme. Finally, the model is applied to analyze the diurnal energy and water cycle characteristics over the Tibetan Plateau using the Game/Tibet datasets observed in May and July of 1998. Heat and energy transfer simulation shows that: (i) There exists a negative feedback mechanism between soil freeze/thaw and soil temperature/ground heat flux; (ii) during freezing period all three heat fluxes do not vary apparently, in spite of the fact that the negative soil temperature is higher than that not considering soil freeze; (iii) during thawing period, ground heat flux increases, and sensible heat flux decreases, but latent heat flux does not change much; and (iv) during freezing period, soil temperature decreases, though ground heat flux increases. © Science in China Press 2006.},

abstract={We study mediation in international conflict as a process of strategic interaction among the two disputants and the (would-be) mediator. We develop a rational model that examines the choice, process, and outcome of mediation. We start with a conflict game of incomplete information played by rational players that examines the conditions under which disputants and would-be mediators would consider mediation a preferred strategy. The mediation game that follows models the mediator's choice of mediation strategy and the possible responses of the disputants offers. Finally, we explore the conditions under which a mediated solution emerges and the conditions under which mediation fails.The credibility of the mediator-defined as the extent to which disputants believe the mediator's statements, threats, or promises and her ability to deliver the promised agreement-emerges as a key factor that drives the model. Each disputant has an assessment of the mediator's credibility. Broadly speaking, the more credible the mediator is perceived by the disputant, the more accepting the disputant will be of her offers. Yet, the mediator does not know how credible she is in the view of the disputants. This uncertainty affects the mediator's decision to intervene and her choice of strategies. We derive testable propositions from this model and test them on a dataset consisting of mediation efforts in international conflicts over the years 1945-1995. The findings generally support the propositions derived from the model, and we explore the theoretical and empirical implications of these findings. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract={Close-range mapping applications such as cultural heritage restoration, virtual reality modeling for the entertainment industry, and anatomical feature recognition for medical activities require 3D data that is usually acquired by high resolution close-range laser scanners. Since these datasets are typically captured from different viewpoints and/or at different times, accurate registration is a crucial procedure for 3D modeling of mapped objects. Several registration techniques are available that work directly with the raw laser points or with extracted features from the point cloud. Some examples include the commonly known Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and a recently proposed technique based on matching spin-images. This research focuses on developing a surface matching algorithm that is based on the Modified Iterated Hough Transform (MIHT) and ICP to register 3D data. The proposed algorithm works directly with the raw 3D laser points and does not assume point-to-point correspondence between two laser scans. The algorithm can simultaneously establish correspondence between two surfaces and estimates the transformation parameters relating them. Experiment with two partially overlapping laser scans of a small object is performed with the proposed algorithm and shows successful registration. A high quality of fit between the two scans is achieved and improvement is found when compared to the results obtained using the spin-image technique. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm for registering 3D laser scanning data in close-range mapping applications to help with the generation of complete 3D models.},

abstract={The Irish hare Lepus timidus hibernicus is of priority conservation concern in Northern Ireland, based on a perceived decline in abundance during the 20th century and on two surveys in 1994-1996 and 2002 that suggested low densities. We reanalysed a 10-year time series [Northern Ireland Rabbit Survey (NIRS)] that has been key evidence of decline, to derive an annual index of abundance during 1986-1995. This showed a rise to a double peak followed by a trough. We compared these Northern Ireland data with two datasets for Lepus timidus scoticus. A 40-year annual index derived from hare bags on Scottish shooting estates [National Game-Bag Census (NGC)] showed strong fluctuations, each lasting several years. Autocorrelation analysis of the NGC data showed elements of cyclical behaviour, with distinct phases and a 16-year period. A previously published 30-year survey of introduced L. t. scoticus in northern England also showed large multi-year fluctuations and phasic behaviour, albeit on a shorter time scale. The NIRS index was strongly correlated with NGC data for the same years, suggesting that it too reflected part of a natural population dynamic. The Species Action Plan for L. t. hibernicus in Northern Ireland includes the aims of maintaining the existing range and demonstrating increase by 2005, and of doubling the population by 2010. We suggest that these aims and the supporting monitoring strategy are inappropriate for a species that shows multi-annual fluctuations in abundance throughout its geographical range. It is important to distinguish self-correcting population processes from trends requiring remedial conservation action. © 2006 The Authors.},

abstract={The role of network structure has grown in significance over the past ten years in the field of information retrieval, stimulated to a great extent by the importance of link analysis in the development of Web search techniques [4]. This body of work has focused primarily on the network that is most clearly visible on the Web: the network of hyperlinks connecting documents to documents. But the Web has always contained a second network, less explicit but equally important, and this is the social network on its users, with latent person-to-person links encoding a variety of relationships including friendship, information exchange, and influence. Developments over the past few years - including the emergence of social networking systems and rich social media, as well as the availability of large-scale e-mail and instant messenging datasets - have highlighted the crucial role played by on-line social networks, and at the same time have made them much easier to uncover and analyze. There is now a considerable opportunity to exploit the information content inherent in these networks, and this prospect raises a number of interesting research challengesWithin this context, we focus on some recent efforts to formalize the problem of searching a social network. The goal is to capture the issues underlying a variety of related scenarios: a member of a social networking system such as MySpace seeks a piece of information that may be held by a friend of a friend [27, 28]; an employee in a large company searches his or her network of colleagues for expertise in a particular subject [9]; a node in a decentralized peer-to-peer file-sharing system queries for a file that is likely to be a small number of hops away [2, 6, 16, 17]; or a user in a distributed IR or federated search setting traverses a network of distributed resources connected by links that may not just be informational but also economic or contractual [3, 5, 7, 8, 13, 18, 21]. In their most basic forms, these scenarios have some essential features in common: a node in a network, without global knowledge, must find a short path to a desired "target" node (or to one of several possible target nodes). To frame the underlying problem, we go back to one of the most well-known pieces of empirical social network analysis - Stanley Milgram's research into the small-world phenomenon, also known as the "six degrees of separation" [19, 24, 25]. The form of Milgram's experiments, in which randomly chosen starters had to forward a letter to a designated target individual, established not just that short chains connecting far-flung pairs of people are abundant in large social networks, but also that the individuals in these networks, operating with purely local information about their own friends and acquaintances, are able to actually find these chains [10]. The Milgram experiments thus constituted perhaps the earliest indication that large-scale social networks are structured to support this type of decentralized search. Within a family of random-graph models proposed by Watts and Strogatz [26], we have shown that the ability of a network to support this type of decentralized search depends in subtle ways on how its "long-range" connections are correlated with the underlying spatial or organizational structure in which it is embedded [10, 11]. Recent studies using data on communication within organizations [1] and the friendships within large on-line communities [15] have established the striking fact that real social networks closely match some of the structural features predicted by these mathematical models. If one looks further at the on-line settings that provide the initial motivation for these issues, there is clearly interest from many directions in their long-term economic implications - essentially, the consequences that follow from viewing distributed information retrieval applications, peer-to-peer systems, or social-networking sites as providing marketplaces for information and services. How does the problem of decentralized search in a network change when the participants are not simply agents following a fixed algorithm, but strategic actors who make decisions in their own self-interest, and may demand compensation for taking part in a protocol? Such considerations bring us into the realm of algorithmic game theory, an active area of current research that uses game-theoretic notions to quantify the performance of systems in which the participants follow their own self-interest [20, 23]. In a simple model for decentralized search in the presence of incentives, we find that performance depends crucially on both the rarity of the information and the richness of the network topology [12] - if the network is too structurally impoverished, an enormous investment may be required to produce a path from a query to an answer.},

abstract={Species that are frequently introduced to an exotic range have a high potential of becoming invasive. Besides propagule pressure, however, no other generally strong determinant of invasion success is known. Although evidence has accumulated that human affiliates (domesticates, pets, human commensals) also have high invasion success, existing studies do not distinguish whether this success can be completely explained by or is partly independent of propagule pressure. Here, we analyze both factors independently, propagule pressure and human affiliation. We also consider a third factor directly related to humans, hunting, and 17 traits on each species' population size and extent, diet, body size, and life history. Our dataset includes all 2362 freshwater fish, mammals, and birds native to Europe or North America. In contrast to most previous studies, we look at the complete invasion process consisting of (1) introduction, (2) establishment, and (3) spread. In this way, we not only consider which of the introduced species became invasive but also which species were introduced. Of the 20 factors tested, propagule pressure and human affiliation were the two strongest determinants of invasion success across all taxa and steps. This was true for multivariate analyses that account for intercorrelations among variables as well as univariate analyses, suggesting that human affiliation influenced invasion success independently of propagule pressure. Some factors affected the different steps of the invasion process antagonistically. For example, game species were much more likely to be introduced to an exotic continent than nonhunted species but tended to be less likely to establish themselves and spread. Such antagonistic effects show the importance of considering the complete invasion process. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Terrain modeling and rendering is essential in construction of realistic virtual environment, for interactive computer games application. Advanced high resolution scanning technologies such as LIDAR enable us to obtain dense and accurate irregular terrain dataset. However, unlike the regular sampled dataset such as DEM and DTED, irregular dataset cannot be rendered in real-time due to random distribution of samples. Moreover, because they generally have huge amount of point data, it is very hard to manipulate them in consumer PC. We propose a fast and efficient terrain rendering method using large-scale irregular dataset for computer games application. First, it reconstructs the geometry by converting irregular dataset into regular one, through resampling input data with regular interval considering the spatial distribution of sample points. It can generate animated scene by applying quad-tree based rendering method to converted dataset. Experimental results show that its image quality is not deteriorated in comparison to the result of rendering reconstructed geometric models. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

We propose a computationally efficient method to achieve this goal. Our method consists of two steps. In the first step we estimate the density function of the rare class alone with an adaptive bandwidth kernel density estimator. The adaptive choice of the bandwidth is inspired by the ancient Chinese board game known today as Go. In the second step we adjust this density locally depending on the density of the background class nearby. We show that the amount of adjustment needed in the second step is approximately equal to the adaptive bandwidth from the first step, which gives us additional computational savings. We name the resulting method LAGO, for "locally adjusted Go-kernel density estimator." We then apply LAGO to a real drug discovery dataset and compare its performance with a number of existing and popular methods. © 2006 American Statistical Association and the American Society for Quality.},

abstract={This paper presents a novel framework of error-correcting output coding (ECOC) addressing the problem of multi-class classification. By weighting the output space of each base classifier which is trained independently, the distance function of decoding is adapted so that the samples are more discriminative. A criterion generated over the Extended Pair Samples (EPS) is proposed to train the weights of output space. Some properties still hold in the new framework: any classifier, as well as distance function, is still applicable. We first conduct empirical studies on UCl datasets to verify the presented framework with four frequently used coding matrixes and then apply it in RoboCup domain to enhance the performance of agent control. Experimental results show that our supervised learned decoding scheme improves the accuracy of classification significantly and betters the ball control of agents in a soccer game after learning from experience. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract={Despite a technology bias which focuses on external electronic threats, insiders pose the greatest threat to commercial and government organizations. One means of preventing insider theft is by stopping potential insiders from becoming actual thieves. In most cases, individuals do not begin work at an organization with the intent of doing harm. Instead, over time something changes resulting in their becoming an insider threat. By detecting warning signs it is possible to discover potential insiders before they become actual insiders. Using the Author Topic [1] clustering algorithm, we discern employees interests from their daily emails. These interests provide a means to create two social networks that are used to locate potential insiders by finding individuals who either (1) feel alienated from the organization (a key warning sign of a possible disgruntled worker) or (2) have a hidden interest in a sensitive(e.g. proprietary or classified) topic. In both cases, this is revealed when someone demonstrates an interest in a topic but does not share that interest with anyone in the organization. The dataset used for this research is the Enron email corpus. Unlike most organizations, Enron has a known whistleblower, Sherron Watkins, who was considered an insider threat by her boss, Andy Fastow, who was engaged in the illegal business practices [2]. The first step of the research resolves the Enron email into a collection of stemmed words and frequency counts (i.e. the number of times each word and each individual occurs in each email). These frequency counts are then fed into Author Topic producing four probability distributions: the probability of a word given a topic (p(w|z)), the probability of an individual given a topic (p(u|z)), the probability of a topic (p(z)) and the probability of a topic given a document (p(z|d)). The second step creates two social networks for each topic. The first, the implicit interest network, is constructed by linking individuals who have shown an interest in the topic. An individual has an interest in a topic if the conditional probability for an individual (p(u|z)) is 1.64 standard deviations above average conditional probability for that topic. The second, the explicit email network, is constructed by linking individuals who have passed an email related to that topic. An email is considered to be related to a topic if the conditional probability for that email (p(d|z)) is 1.64 standard deviations above average conditional probability for that topic. Individuals who have links in the implicit interest network but not the explicit email network and classified as having a clandestine interest in that topic. In looking for potential insiders using the Enron dataset, the first step is selecting the social networks related to a sensitive topic. For this investigation, this topic concerns the off-book partnerships called the Raptors. Four topics emerge with a non-zero conditional probability for the word "raptor". The next step is checking which individuals have clandestine interests in these topics. These individuals have a link in the implicit interest network but none in the explicit email network. This reduces the list of potential insiders from over 34,000 to 71. This process is then repeated using the topics that concern socializing in order to determine which employees may be feeling alienated. Since there is no clear word that defines socializing, several words are used including dinner, drink, fun, tonight, love, weekend, family and game. Two topics emerge with a non-zero probability for all of these words. When the individuals with clandestine interests in socializing are compared with individuals with a clandestine interest in the off-book partnerships, only three individuals emerge with a clandestine interest in both. Sherron Watkins is one of the three individuals. Author Topic emerges from this research as an effective tool at revealing potential insiders by datamining email. The topics generated by Author Topic are easily identifiable both based on the most probable words as well as the most probable individuals. In addition, Author Topic effectively reveals Sherron Watkins as a potential insider by flagging both her interest in the Raptor topic as well as her failure to communicate that interest via email to any of her colleagues. However, it is one thing to show that the signs existed that an individual was an insider after the fact. What is needed is to show that Author Topic would have revealed her before the fact. The analysis shows this as well since Sherron Watkins is one of only 3 individuals (out of a possible 34,000) with both a clandestine interest in the Raptor topic and a clandestine interest in socializing. If there was cause for concern that someone might leak information about the Raptors, this analysis would have generated, prior to the leak, a short list of people to pay closer attention to. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

Given two or more animation drawings represented by DBSC, the intermediate frames can be automatically generated to form a smoother sequence, either linearly or non-linearly. Moreover, compared to other models like polygon and triangle mesh, DBSC allows more flexible manipulation of brushstroke. With smaller dataset, DBSC has advantages to store and transmit the model across the network thus may be suitable to online games and animation.},

abstract={Recent research has focused on detecting the "gaming" behavior of students while using an intelligent tutoring system. For instance, Baker, Corbett & Koedinger (2004) reported detecting "gaming" by students, and argued that it explained lower learning results for these students. In this paper, we report that while our computer system's correlation with a student's actual state test score is well correlated (r=.7), we found that we were systematically under-predicting their scores. We wondered if that underprediction had to do with students engaging in some form of gaming. In this paper, we look to see if some of the online metrics (e.g. rate of asking for hints) Baker et al reported correlated with our under-prediction of student's scores. We report results from the Assistment Project's data set of about 70 students collected from May, 2004. We performed a stepwise regression to predict what metrics help to explain our poor prediction of state exam scores. We conclude that while none of the metrics we used were statistically significant, several of the metrics were correlated with our under-prediction, suggesting that there is information in these signals but that it might be too weak for the small sample size we have. For future work, we need to replicate this method with the dataset we are collecting this year that has 600 students using the system for 10 times as long.},

abstract={The increasing interest in time series data mining in the last decade has resulted in the introduction of a variety of similarity measures, representations, and algorithms. Surprisingly, this massive research effort has had little impact on real world applications. Real world practitioners who work with time series on a daily basis rarely take advantage of the wealth of tools that the data mining community has made available. In this work, we attempt to address this problem by introducing a simple parameter-light tool that allows users to efficiently navigate through large collections of time series. Our system has the unique advantage that it can be embedded directly into any standard graphical user interfaces, such as Microsoft Windows, thus making deployment easier. Our approach extracts features from a time series of arbitrary length and uses information about the relative frequency of its features to color a bitmap in a principled way. By visualizing the similarities and differences within a collection of bitmaps, a user can quickly discover clusters, anomalies, and other regularities within their data collection. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a set of comprehensive experiments on real datasets from a variety of domains. Copyright © by SIAM.},

abstract={We investigate differences in the dynamics of marketing decisions across geographic markets empirically. We begin with a linear-quadratic game involving forward-looking firms competing on prices and advertising. Based on the corresponding Markov perfect equilibrium, we propose estimable econometric equations for demand and marketing policy. Our model allows us to measure empirically the strategic response of competitors along with economic measures such as firm profitability. We use a rich dataset that combines sales, marketing mix, factor cost, and advertising cost data for eighteen geographic markets in the frozen entrée category. We find that larger markets tend to be less price-sensitive and more profitable than smaller markets. We also find evidence of positive carryover of own advertising on own demand. In terms of consumer substitution patterns, we find that the role of advertising (in our data) seems to be more category-building (complementary) than share-stealing (competitive). The complementary role is stronger in larger markets. On the supply side, we find that firms make smaller adjustments to own advertising as goodwill goes up. Consistent with cross-advertising effects on demand, firms make smaller (larger) adjustments to advertising in response to competitive goodwill in the less competitive larger (in the more competitive smaller) markets. Finally, we find that consumer welfare decreases (increases) in larger (smaller) markets when firms move to a zero-advertising regime. © 2005 INFORMS.},

abstract={Introduction: The number of wild boars in Europe has dramatically increased in the past 2 decades, consequently new habitats have been occupied by this species. Wild boars are omnivores and thus, have a wide spectrum of food including meat from small rodents or perished foxes. Foxes in turn are known to be the major reservoir hosts for Trichinella britovi. If an infected dead fox is found by a sounder, it can be assumed that the parasite is effectively transferred to the majority of the group. The fact that meat from wild boar is frequently consumed raw or undercooked presents a potential risk of Trichinella infections for humans. Although in some areas approaches for routine Trichinella inspection of game are established, the amount of uninspected wild boar meat - especially for private consumption - must still be considered high. This work focuses on the areas of Trichinella findings in red foxes and the overlapping distribution of wild boars in Austria for the definition of potential risk areas. Materials and methods: Data from several surveys on Trichinella in foxes conducted by the Institute of Parasitology and Zoology (University of Veterinary Medicine Vienna) were combined resulting in a large dataset on district level. The average numbers of wild boars shot or found dead per km 2 from 1989 to 1993 were compared with the average in the years 1999-2003. Combining datasets over several years served to smoothen the data by qualifying outliers. Results: Trichinella spp. were found in red foxes in 31 of the 121 districts of Austria. From 1989 to 1993 wild boars were registered in 94 districts with a higher density in the Northeast of Austria. During this period 18 wild boar districts overlapped with Trichinella districts. 10 years later, 1999 to 2003, the wild boar density increased and their range was extended southeastwards to 100 districts leading to 21 overlapping areas. Additionally, 2 districts recently colonized by wild boars are located in immediate neighbourhood to Trichinella positive areas. Conclusion: In Austria the population of wild boars is increasing. This is presumably due to the absence of natural selection among the offspring in cold winters and due to the availability of nutrition. A spread to previously free regions (e.g. alpine regions of Southwest Austria) is the consequence. These new areas are especially known to be the centre zones of Trichinella spp. infections in red foxes. In the course of this study 3 new overlapping districts were found. In 2 districts bordering Trichinella endemic areas a concomitance of the parasite and of wild boars cannot be excluded. Similar to wild boars the fox population is also increasing. In Austria the number of vulpine road-kills per registered car increased since 1991 by the factor 2.24. In situations of endemic stability of Trichinella spp. in red foxes a higher potential risk is obviously emerging from increased contact rates based on an increasing density both of wild boars and red foxes. Pigs and wild boars are susceptible to a variety of Trichinella spp. that also infect other mammals including humans, such as T. britovi, T. spiralis and T. pseudospiralis. Human infections with these parasites from wild boar meat have been reported from several European countries. In subarctic regions wild boars also can serve as hosts for Trichinella nativa. Therefore the potential risk of zoonotic transmission should be kept in mind and the distribution and spread of the wild boars especially into known Trichinella spp. areas should be observed in the future. The successfully implemented Trichinella-inspection model for Lower Austria could be adopted in these areas.},

This paper defines and applies a new equilibrium concept in games with private information, cursed equilibrium, which assumes that each player correctly predicts the distribution of other players' actions, but underestimates the degree to which these actions are correlated with other players' information. We apply the concept to common-values auctions, where cursed equilibrium captures the widely observed phenomenon of the winner's curse, and to bilateral trade, where cursedness predicts trade in adverse-selections settings for which conventional analysis predicts no trade. We also apply cursed equilibrium to voting and signalling models. We test a single-parameter variant of our model that embeds Bayesian Nash equilibrium as a special case and find that parameter values that correspond to cursedness fit a broad range of experimental datasets better than the parameter value that corresponds to Bayesian Nash equilibrium.},

A TAC agent simulates one vision of future travel agents: it represents a set of clients in simultaneous auctions, trading complementary (e.g., airline tickets and hotel reservations) and substitutable (e.g., symphony and theater tickets) goods. RoxyBot faced two key technical challenges in TAC: (i) allocation - - assigning purchased goods to clients at the end of a game instance so as to maximize total client utility, and (ii) completion - - determining the optimal quantity of each resource to buy and sell given client preferences, current holdings, and market prices. For the dimensions of TAC, an optimal solution to the allocation problem is tractable, and RoxyBot uses a search algorithm based on A* to produce optimal allocations. An optimal solution to the completion problem is also tractable, but in the interest of minimizing bidding cycle time, RoxyBot solves the completion problem using beam search with a greedy heuristic, producing approximately optimal completions. RoxyBot's completer relies on an innovative data structure called a priceline. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.},

Nested random expected utility models (REUMs) are estimated with a panel dataset of individual choices of lottery-rationed harvest rights for wild game. Empirical results indicate that the types and timing of tariff payments affect participation, choices over rationed and open access alternatives and the benefits derived from changes in the quality and quantity of the lottery-rationed access opportunities. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Since the papers of Basu et al. (1985) and Lal and Srinivasan (1993), marketing academics have been interested in the design and implementation of optimal compensation plans. The literature has focused on agency theory as a foundation to help describe and understand this process. Although there has been much theoretical work on this topic, empirical evidence to support this theory remains sparse. Studies by Coughlan and Narasimhan (1992) and John and Weitz (1988, 1989) have found some early evidence that supports agency theory. In this paper we revisit the issue of salesforce compensation on both theoretical and empirical fronts. On the theory side we build a game theoretic model of salesforce compensation that accounts for risk aversion on the part of both the principal and the agent. We further show that accounting for the firm size within the analytical framework yields new insights into the nature of compensation design. The results obtained from our model, while substantiating past findings, offer some new insights into the compensation design process. In particular we find that firm demographics play an important role in the design of the optimal compensation scheme. We then use two datasets collected ten years apart by the Dartnell Corporation to investigate and test hypotheses generated by our model and the extant literature. Our results show that the basic tenets of agency theory continue to hold over time and that our new theoretical hypotheses are consistent with the data. Using the two datasets we also find that inter-temporal changes in salesforce compensation coincide with the advent and adoption of new technologies. Our research thus adds to our substantive knowledge of the drivers of salesforce compensation, while adding to the theoretical structure through taking account of the possibility of principal risk aversion. © Springer Science + Business Media, Inc. 2005.},

abstract={Distributed Interactive Applications (DIAs) have been gaining commercial success in recent years due to the widespread appeal of networked multiplayer computer games. Within these games, participants interact with each other and their environment, producing complex behavioural patterns that evolve over time. These patterns are non-linear, and often appear to exhibit dependencies under certain conditions. In this paper, we analyse the behavioural patterns of two users interacting in a DIA. Our motivation behind this analysis is to construct models of user behaviour that can be used within Entity-State-Update (ESU) mechanisms. By representing their behaviour as time-series datasets, we investigate the use of simple statistical dependence measures to help partition the datasets and identify three different types of behavioural states exhibited by the two users. It is our intention that future research on ESU mechanisms can utilize this behavioural partitioning to reduce the network traffic in a DIA based on a hybrid-model approach. © 2004 IEEE.},

abstract={Support Vector Machines (SVM) for pattern recognition are discriminant binary classifiers. One of the approaches to extend them to multi-class case is pairwise classification. Pairwise comparisons for each pair of classes are combined together to predict the class or to estimate class probabilities. This paper presents a novel approach, which considers the pairwise SVM classification as a decision-making problem and involves game theory methods to solve it. We prove that in such formulation the solution in pure minimax strategies is equivalent to the solution given by standard fuzzy pairwise SVM method. On the other hand, if we use mixed strategies we formulate new linear programming based pairwise SVM method for estimating class probabilities. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method in experiments with several benchmark datasets, including datasets for optical character recognition and multi-class text categorization problems. ©2004 IEEE.},

abstract={We have investigated the performance of five well known scoring functions in predicting the binding affinities of a diverse set of 205 protein-ligand complexes with known experimental binding constants, and also on subsets of mutually similar complexes. We have found that the overall performance of the scoring functions on the diverse set is disappointing, with none of the functions achieving r2 values above 0.32 on the whole dataset. Performance on the subsets was mixed, with four of the five functions predicting fairly well the binding affinities of 35 proteinases, but none of the functions producing any useful correlation on a set of 38 aspartic proteinases. We consider two algorithms for producing consensus scoring functions, one based on a linear combination of scores from the five individual functions and the other on averaging the rankings produced by the five functions. We find that both algorithms produce consensus functions that generally perform slightly better than the best individual scoring function on a given dataset.},

abstract={The regressivity of lotteries has become an increasingly important issue in the U.S. as the number of state-run lotteries has increased. Despite this, we still know relatively little about the nature of lottery regressivity. I use a new dataset on Powerball lotto sales to analyze how regressivity varies with jackpot size within a single lotto game. I find that this large-stakes game is significantly less regressive at higher jackpot sizes. Out-of-sample extrapolation of this result suggests the possibility of progressivity at jackpots substantially higher than those currently experienced. This may indicate that concerns about regressivity might be allayed by concentrating lotto games to produce higher average jackpots.},

abstract={Ptarmigan and grouse species (Lagopus spp.) are thought to be able to compensate for a modest harvest because there is a surplus of breeding birds that are prevented from breeding by territory holders. To estimate the degree of harvest-mortality compensation reliably we experimentally harvested 0%, 15% and 30% of the willow ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) on 13 estates ranging from 20 to 54 km2 in size during four hunting seasons in Norway according to a regional block design. Population overwinter growth rate was strongly negatively density dependent, but despite this, and contrary to earlier findings, only 33% of the harvest was compensated for. The lack of compensation was probably caused by long-distance juvenile dispersal that was unaffected by the harvest. The need for large-scale management experiments to detect the effects of harvest was clearly demonstrated: lack of compensation was found only when we used the whole dataset and not when the data were analysed by year or block. Our study shows that it is very difficult to demonstrate a population's lack of harvest compensation and warns against using small-scale, out-of-season or poorly replicated studies as a basis for future harvest-management decisions.},

abstract={This paper reviews a range of approaches to the analysis of government termination, by any account a very important substantive concern for political science, One essential preliminary matter is the distinction between government duration and government durability - the former an essentially empirical concept, the latter essentially theoretical. It is also important to note that empirical research into government termination is heavily conditioned by the precise definition of what marks the end of one government and the beginning of the next. Approaches to analyzing government termination can be divided into those that are fundamentally empirical and those based on a priori modeling. Both research traditions are reviewed. The empiricist approach has evolved into a body of work that applies increasingly sophisticated event-history models to a dataset that has become to a large extent common within the profession. The a priori approach has developed within the traditions of noncooperative game theory to model the responses of key actors to new information, for example, about the likely results of an election that might be called if the government were to fall. There is clearly unfulfilled potential to merge these two research traditions into a single more comprehensive account of government termination.},

abstract={The radar backscattering coefficient is mainly determined by surface soil moisture, vegetation and land surface roughness under a given configuration of the satellite sensor. It is observed that the temporal variations of the three variables are different, the variation of vegetation and roughness are at the longer temporal scales corresponding to climate and cultivation practices, while soil moisture varies at a shorter temporal scale in response to weather forcing. Based on this hypothesis, a robust method for the determination of relative soil moisture is proposed for application to the ERS Wind Scatterometer database and the Pathfinder AVHRR dataset. Ground measured soil moisture data collected during GAME/Tibet field experiment are used to validate the proposed method. The results show that the estimated relative soil moisture corresponds closely to local precipitation at two GAME/Tibet field sites. The volumetric soil moisture converted from the Wind Scatterometer estimated relative soil moisture is in good agreement with the measured 0-4 cm topsoil volumetric soil moisture. The regional distributions of relative soil moisture are evaluated and correlated well to the ground measured volumetric soil moisture. It is concluded that the large footprint Wind Scatterometer dataset can capture ground soil wetness variation in arid and semi-arid zone with the aid of vegetation information derived from other sensors.},

abstract={The generation of a fully textured 3-D model of a person's face presents difficult technical challenges, but has many applications in several fields, such as video games, immersive telepresence, and medicine. Current commercial systems rely on booth-like set-ups, equipped with laser-based scanners, or project a pattern on the subject's face. The major drawbacks of such systems are the cost of the hardware they require, and the lack of operational flexibility. We present here a fully automatic system to generate a 3-D model from a sequence of images taken by a single camera. Unlike other methods, we do not use a generic 3-D face subject to deformation, but instead proceed in a fully bottom-up fashion. The approach is a two-stage process. First, we estimate for each view the pose of the object with respect to the camera. This is accomplished by robust feature matching and global bundle adjustment. Then, we consider sets of adjacent views, which we treat as stereo pairs, and generate partial depth maps, which are then integrated into a single 3-D model. The texture is obtained by merging the images themselves. We describe the algorithm in detail, and show results on a number of real datasets. © 2002 IEEE.},

abstract={Selection and negotiation of purchasing bids is a complex decision making process that requires consideration of a variety of vendor attributes such as price, delivery performance, and quality. Although several decision models have been utilized for vendor evaluation and selection, this paper proposes a buyer-seller game model that has distinct advantages over existing methods for bid selection and negotiation. The model effectively evaluates alternative bids based on the ideal targets set by the buyer. The alternative bid ratings are then utilized in an integer programming model in selecting an optimal set of bids that satisfy the buyer's demand requirements. The model also assists in proposing effective negotiation strategies for unselected bids in order to make them competitive. Finally, the paper proposes four variations of the model for evaluating different bid scenarios thereby providing flexibility for the buyer in selecting the appropriate method. The model application is demonstrated through a previously published dataset from a pharmaceutical company. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Conservation biologists often wish to predict how vertebrate populations will respond to local or global changes in conditions such as those resulting from sea-level rise, deforestation, exploitation, genetically modified crops, global warming, human disturbance or from conservation activities. Predicting the consequences of such changes almost always requires understanding the population growth rate and the density dependence. Traditional means of directly measuring density dependence are often extremely difficult and have the problem that if the environment changes then it is necessary to remeasure the density dependence. We describe an alternative approach that does not require such long datasets and can be used to predict the density dependence under novel conditions. Game theory can be used to describe behavioural decisions that individuals make in response to interference, prey depletion, territorial behaviour or social dominance, and the resultant fitness consequences. It is then possible to predict how survival or reproductive output changes with population size. From this we can then make predictions about the responses of populations to environmental changes. We will illustrate how this can be applied to a range of species and a range of applied problems.},

abstract={The Mohave ground squirrel, Spermophilus mohavensis, is listed as threatened by the California Fish and Game Commission. Challenges to this listing have focused on the general lack of information on this species, which prompted this review of sampling data. We found that current datasets, while a rich source of data on squirrel occurrences, are of limited use for developing Mohave ground squirrel habitat models because survey methods varied in reliability, surveys that did not find squirrels are rarely reported, and many important environmental variables were inconsistently reported. To improve the utility of future datasets, we recommend that reports attempt to include 40 variables related to trap characteristics, trapping protocol, demographic features, health information, weather parameters, and site descriptions. We also found that trapping success decreased significantly between 1980 and 2000 across most of the Mohave ground squirrel range, and this decline was not correlated with winter rainfall which generally increased between 1984 and 1998. We recommend that the results of project surveys and trapping studies should be maintained by the CDFG, allowing for future population trend analyses and development of habitat models. We also recommend that studies be initiated to determine if the decline in trapping success continues into the near future and to identify the causes of this trend.},

abstract={Putnam's metaphor of a two-level game that state representatives play when they face the dual constraints of international bargaining and domestic pressures has been applied across different political systems. This paper argues that it is important to take into account differences in state structures and political processes in the study of international negotiations. That state structures and processes are important has become a common theme in current research on foreign policy, decision making, and international conflict. Building on this literature, this study involves a meta-analysis of existing case studies of two-level games. The previously completed cases provide evidence of variation in the characteristics of two-level games. Independent measures of the institutional structures of the states involved in the set of case studies are collected from the POLITY III dataset. Hypotheses on how differences in state structures might influence the characteristics of two-level bargaining are then examined. The study finds that differences in state structures do influence the dynamics of two-level games. Some of the results support the conventional wisdom on this relationship, while other results suggest counter-intuitive insights. A framework conceptualizing state characteristics at three levels is proposed for future research. © 2001 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N.V.

This dataset also has some validation data (soil temperature and snow depth). All models succeeded in forecasting the soil freezing process, since there were no large differences in the ground surface flux. However, there were large differences in the Bowen ratio due to the differences in parametarization of stomatal resistance. It is expected that these differences in the Bowen ratio will cause a large difference when these land surface schemes are coupled with GCM or reg-CM. Large differences in snow amount are attributable to the differences in the estimation of albedo. © 2001, Meteorological Society of Japan.},

abstract={Elk (Cervus elaphus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are highly valued for their game, aesthetic, and spiritual qualities by sportsman, wildlife enthusiasts, and Native Americans in North America. As part of the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project (ICBEMP) of the US Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, we: (1) defined key habitat associations of those species that could be used for a broad-scale (58 million hectares) analysis of management practices and (2) determined how three ecosystem management alternatives of a supplemental draft environmental impact statement (SDEIS) might affect the regional distribution of habitat for those species across the Basin over the next 100 years. For the three species, we developed a Bayesian Belief Network model that used available SDEIS datasets to estimate historical, current, and future habitat capability under the management alternatives in each of the 7467 subwatersheds (mean 8000 ha) in the study area. The model quantified "inherent habitat capability" as a function primarily of forage habitat capability, with cover as a minor influence. Forage habitat capability was a function of the percentage area of rangeland and early seral forest community types, and the qualitative influences of livestock overgrazing, wildfire, and prescribed fire. For the current and future periods, an "adjusted habitat capability" was estimated by adjusting inherent habitat capability for the negative effects of poor security from human disturbance. Open road density, cover area, and a terrain relief index were used to estimate the security effect. Habitat capability was reported by 15 ecological regions within the study area as mean subwatershed capability. Under all management alternatives, habitat capability increased about 5% for all three ungulate species over the next 100 years. Limitations of the coarse analysis scale restrict application of the model to large-scale assessments. Lacking regional population data, verification of model output was not feasible at the scale of analysis. However, the model was considered useful for tracking regional changes given the available habitat data and regional-scale objectives of the effort.},

abstract={The focus of the article is the fiscal performance of minority governments. Hypotheses are generated by embedding George Tsebelis's veto player model in a war of attrition game. It is shown that Tsebelis hypotheses also hold in the extended model: Increasing the burden-sharing conflict between veto players (a minority government and a parliamentary majority) and decreasing the disutility of the status quo (the cost of maintaining a budget deficit) both lower the probability of fiscal stabilization. The extended model has two additional implications. First, the probability of fiscal stabilization decreases positively in the ratio of disutility over burden-sharing. Second, the probability of fiscal stabilization increases in the discount factor of the veto players. The full set of implications from the extended model is tested on a dataset consisting of 13 west European countries over the years 1978-95. The data do not seem to falsify the implications.},

abstract={For information retrieval (IR) tasks, user models are used to estimate user's true intention and demand. Unfortunately, most user models are constructed in a specialized form that is not applied to other systems or domains. This specialization makes difficulty in sharing user models as common resources for developing information retrieval systems and for researching cognitive characteristics in various users. In order to solve this problem, we need a general user modeling method. In this paper, a user model based on probabilistic framework is proposed. We call this model as generative user model. The generative user model represents user's mental depth by latent (hidden) variables. It also have visible variables that mean word set and qualifier of each word as a subjective probability distribution. The model can handle uncertainty of user's subjectivity by probabilistic framework. Recent statistical studies for such latent models give learning algorithm. Our generative user model can be constructed from dataset taken by information retrieval tasks. As an example, we also introduce two different kinds of information retrieval systems, ART MUSEUM (Multimedia Database with Sense of Color and Construction upon the Matter of ART) and DSIU (Decision Support for Internet Users). The generative user model is applied to these systems. The properties of the model and interactive learning mechanism are shown.},

abstract={The issue of "power" in the marketing channels for consumer products has received considerable attention in both academic and practitioner journals as well as in the popular press. Our objective in this paper is to provide an empirical method to measure the power of channel members and to understand the reasons (demand factors, cost factors, nature of channel interactions) for this power. We confine our analysis to pricing power in channels. We use methods from the game-theory literature in marketing on channel interactions to obtain the theoretical framework for our empirical model. This literature provides us a definition of power - one that is based on the proportion (or percentage) of channel profits that accrue to each of the channel members. There can be a variety of possible channel interactions between manufacturers and retailers in channels. The theoretical literature has examined some of these games. For example, Choi (1991) examines how channel profits for manufacturers and retailer vary if channel interactions are either vertical Nash, or if they are Stackelberg leader-follower with either the manufacturer or the retailer being the price leader. Each of these three channel interaction games has different implications for profits made by manufacturers and retailers, and consequently for the relative power of the channel members. In contrast to the previous literature that has focused largely on the above three channel interaction games, our model extends the game-theoretic literature by allowing for a continuum of possible channel interactions between manufacturers and a retailer. Furthermore, for a given product market, we empirically estimate from the data where the channel interactions lie in this continuum. More critically, we obtain measures of how channel profits are divided between manufacturers and the retailer in the product market, where a higher share of channel profit is associated with higher channel power. We then examine how channel power is related to demand conditions facing various brands and cost parameters of various manufacturers. In going from game-theory-based theoretical models of channel interactions to empirical estimation, we use the "new empirical industrial organization" framework (Bresnahan 1988). As part of this structural modeling framework, we build retail-level demand functions for the various brands (manufacturer and private label) in a given product category. Given these demand functions, we obtain optimal pricing rules for manufacturers and the retailer. In determining their optimal prices, manufacturers and the retailer account for how all the players in the channel choose their optimal prices. That is, we account for dependencies in decision making across channel members. These dependencies are characterized by a set of "conduct parameters," which are estimated from market data. The conduct parameters enable us to identify the nature of channel interactions between manufacturers and the retailer (along the continuum mentioned previously). In addition to the demand and conduct parameters, manufacturers' marginal costs are also estimated in the model. These marginal cost estimates, along with the manufacturer prices and retail prices available in our dataset, enable us to compute the division of channel profits among the channel members. Hence, we are able to obtain insights into who has pricing power in the channel. In the empirical application of the model, we analyze a local market for two product categories: refrigerated juice and tuna. In both categories, there are three major brands. The difference between them is that the private label has an insignificant market share in the tuna category. Our main empirical results show that the usual games examined in the marketing literature do not hold for the given data. We also find that the retailer's market power is very significant in both these product categories, and that the estimated demand and cost parameters are consistent with the estimated pattern of conduct between the manufacturers and the retailer. Given the evidence from the trade press of intense manufacturer competition in these categories, as well as the "commodity" nature of these products, the result of retailer power appears intuitive.},

abstract={Geographic information systems (GIS) are quickly becoming an important tool for policy analysis and program evaluation in urban administration and social science. This chapter explores the use of GIS in the analysis of neighborhood stability and evaluation of Housing Conservation District program in St. Louis City. There are three key benefits of using GIS in this type of analysis. First, thematic mapping permits the visualization of data clusters that may be associated with certain public policies. In addition, statistical procedures can find the absence or presence of clustering. The visual presentation of data in map form is particularly powerful for both influencing public policy and conveying information in a non-technical way to a variety of policy stakeholders. Second, GIS permits the combination of different units and levels of analysis into a single dataset through various kinds of table joins. Finally, the location information in GIS can be used to create contiguity and distance matrices for spatial econometric analysis. Taking advantage of these three benefits of GIS, it becomes clear in this study that the long-term emphasis on downtown and entertainment district development has not curbed population emigration from the city and that Housing Conservation Districts may be responsible for higher property vacancy rates.},

abstract={The primary focus of this article is to break the ties to examining democracies to the exclusion of other regime types. Inspired by work in the two-level games approach to the larger question of foreign policy behavior, we broaden the two-level approach by examining the impact of domestic factors on decisionmaking across regime types and how they relate to the use and extent of violence in international crisis. Our analysis is bounded substantively and conceptually, however, by our exclusive focus in this article on decisionmaking in international crises. We use the 895 foreign policy crisis cases of the International Crisis Behavior (ICB) dataset for our analysis, which entails an examination of process and decisionmaking structural variables using cross-tabulations and a series of logistic regression models. We find that democracies exhibit many behaviors similar to non-democracies in crisis. The prevalent effects of action-reaction processes that result from the initial impact of the crisis-trigger suppress cross-regime type differences, at least in the initial stages of a crisis. Differences across regime types manifest themselves when looking at the entire crisis time period.},

However, the conventional methods of region-based segmentation and gradient-based boundary finding are often frustrated by poor image quality. Here we propose a method to integrate the two approaches using game theory in an effort to form a unified approach that is robust to noise and poor initialization. This combines the perceptual notions of complete boundary information using edge data and shape priors with gray-level homogeneity using two computational modules. The novelty of the method is that this is a bidirectional framework, whereby both computational modules improve their results through mutual information sharing. A number of experiments were performed both on synthetic datasets and datasets of real images to evaluate the new approach and it is shown that the integrated method typically performs better than conventional gradient-based boundary finding. © 1999 IEEE.},

An observer watching a gambler on a winning streak may suspect that the game is fixed, but it is not necessary to depart from standard probability theory to account for series of low-probability events. Enduring rivalries research often uses frequency counts of militarized disputes to identify rivalries as "enduring." Nevertheless, discernible patterns in dispute data could be hot hands. Using the same datasets and definitions as the original researchers, we test the hypothesis that the number of enduring rivalries reported in the literature is significantly different from the number generated by a model in which disputes are randomly distributed. We compare the null model to existing definitions of enduring rivalry using a Poisson process. We find that we cannot reject the hypothesis that dispute series identified as enduring rivalries result from a stochastic process.},

Such applications must often share the interconnect with traditional compute intensive parallel/distributed applications that are usually driven by latency requirements in contrast to jitter, loss rate, or throughput requirements. The challenge is to develop a communication infrastructure that effectively manages the network resources to enable the diverse QoS requirements to be met. The major components of QUIC include (1) use of powerful, processors embedded in the network interfaces, (2) scheduling paradigms for concurrently satisfying distinct QoS requirements over multiple streams, (3) re-configurable hardware support to enable complex scheduling decisions to be made in the desired time frames, and (4) a flexible and extensible virtual communication machine that provides a uniform interface for dynamically adding hardware/software functionality to the network interfaces (NIs). This papers reviews the goals, approach and current status of this project.},

abstract={Heritabilities of traits related to game-bird hunting, measured in the natural ability test of the North American Versatile Hunting Dog Association (NAVHDA), were calculated using midparent offspring regressions for five breeds of continental huntIng dogs. Heritabilities of use of nose, search, and waterwork were moderate (0.250.39). Heritability of pointing was high (>0.40) in one breed but only moderate in the combined dataset. Desire, cooperation, and tracking were not significantly correlated between midparent average and offspring. One of the breeds, large munsterlander, was analyzed for improvement over the past 15 years. The NAVHDA testing system is used to select breeding stock in the large munsterlander and improvement in scores was significant.},

abstract={In this paper we propose a methodology for organising the users of an information providing system into groups with common interests (communities). The communities are built using unsupervised learning techniques on data collected from the users (user models). We examine a system that filters news on the Internet, according to the interests of the registered users. Each user model contains the user’s interests on the news categories covered by the information providing system. Two learning algorithms are evaluated: COBWEB and ITERATE. Our main concern is whether meaningful communities can be constructed. We specify a metric to decide which news categories are representative for each community. The construction of meaningful communities can be used for improving the structure of the information providing system as well as for suggesting extensions to individual user models. Encouraging results on a large data-set lead us to consider this work as a first step towards a method that can easily be integrated in a variety of information systems. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1998.},

abstract={The technology for three-dimensional model design of real world scenes and its photorealistic rendering are current topic of investigation. Development of such technology is very attractive to implement in vast variety of applications: military mission planning, crew training, civil engineering, architecture, virtual reality entertainments - just a few was mentioned. 3D photorealistic models of urban areas are often discussed now as upgrade from existing two-dimensional geographic information systems. Possibility of site model generation with small details depends on two main factors: available source dataset and computer power resources. In this paper PC based technology is presented, so the scenes of middle resolution (scale of 1:1000) be constructed. Types of datasets are the gray level aerial stereo pairs of photographs (scale of 1:14000) and tree color on ground photographs of buildings (scale ca.1:1000). True color terrestrial photographs are also necessary for photorealistic rendering, that in high extent improves human perception of the scene.},

In this paper, we present our interactive tools which enable extraction of surfaces for different organs, including bones, muscles, fascia, and skin, from the VHD. The reconstructed surfaces then are used for defining the inter-relationship of organs, a process we refer to as topological modeling. A data base is constructed, which encapsulates structural, topological, mechanical and other relevant information about organs. A 3D interactive tool enables the building and editing of this data base. Such a data base can later be used for different applications in fields such as medicine, sports, education, and entertainment.},

abstract={Modeling with medical images in this context provides both structural and topological information of different elements. In addition to displaying these elements, the interest is in using them for physically based deformation simulation, motion generation and analysis, and model validation. The Visible Human Dataset (VHD) has provided a referential standard as medical image data for modeling. Surface based models fitting to the boundary of the medical image data are extracted and interactive 3D tools are employed for their investigation, analysis and manipulation. A comprehensive database consisting of the structural as well as topological description of a body part (here the upper limb) is built. In addition to the medical field, topological modeling of human anatomy applies to other areas such as sports, education and entertainment involving animation/simulation. © The authors 1996.},

abstract={Seed mass is correlated with a number of other plant traits, including dispersal mode, growth form and specific leaf area. Specific leaf area is the main determinant of potential relative growth rate and an indicator of the site quality to which a species is adapted. The relationships with dispersal mode and growth form have consistent form in five datasets from three continents, and each account for about 20-30% of variation in log seed mass. Thus, there is also very substantial variation within growth form and dispersal categories. Much, but not all, of the 20-30% is associated with shifted family composition between growth forms or dispersal modes. Experiments have shown that seedlings of larger-seeded species are better able to survive hazards including deep shade, drought, physical damage and the presence of competing vegetation. If there is a common mechanism under these different hazards, it seemingly must be a 'reserve effect', whereby during deployment and early growth larger-seeded species hold a bigger percentage of seed reserves uncommitted to seedling structure and available to support respiration or repair damage. A reserve effect has not yet been demonstrated directly. It remains possible that different mechanisms operate under different hazards. Under a reserve effect, advantages of larger seed size should be temporary, and temporary advantage has indeed been observed with regard to seedling survival under dense shade. Although larger seed mass confers benefits on seedlings, larger seeds must necessarily be produced in smaller numbers per unit of resource allocated. Seed mass is presumed to have evolved as a compromise between these counterposed pressures. Yet there has proved to be surprisingly little difference in average seed mass between very different vegetation regions, at least in temperate climates. Rather, there is startlingly wide variation in seed mass among species growing interspersed with each other. Recent applications of game theory may be capable of accounting for this wide variation between coexisting species, but at present these models are driven by competition among seedling species (as opposed to between seedlings and adults). It remains unclear whether competition among seedlings is a decisive influence on species composition in most of the world's vegetation types.},

abstract={Four experiments tested the hypothesis that people's appreciation for the statistical law of large numbers may at times lead them to ignore other important statistical information when making inferential judgments. In Experiment 1 subjects were presented with either a small or a large dataset that detailed the performance of two racquetball players, each of whom played a different number of games in two different leagues. Results indicated that, compared to large dataset subjects, small dataset subjects were more likely to aggregate across situations and thus less likely to take into account the confounding effects of the league. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this effect occurs even under conditions in which people are explicitly informed about the differing situational constraints. Experiment 3 again replicated the effect, and examined more closely the effects of sample size on within-situation performance assessments as well as on statistical inference strategies. Experiment 4 replicated the sample size effect in a more socially relevant judgment domain involving inferences about intelligence. These results illuminate an intriguing and ironic relation between different aspects of everday statistical reasoning. Discussion focuses on the implications for inference processes and social judgment. © 1992.},
