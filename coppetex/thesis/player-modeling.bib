Findings suggest that the meaning work takes on for workers in their experience of it, rather than a specific set of attributes, constitutes competence.

In doing so, we respond to a recent call for research that is specific about human resource management-firm effectiveness relationships. Moderated relationships between competence, commitment and control are proposed as predictors of intellectual capital. Implications for future theory and practice are highlighted.},

How far have countries progressed toward lifelong learning for all? Who is being left behind, and in what ways? How might schools evolve to address remaining gaps?  In this special edition of Education Policy Analysis prepared as background for the 2001 meeting of OECD education ministers, these questions and others are explored. The analysis shows that progress and success in realising lifelong learning for all depend on clarity in framing objectives for lifelong learning and appropriate information for monitoring policy experience and examining policy options. The five chapters in this book draw upon the policy experience and trends in OECD countries to examine: -- promising directions for lifelong learning policies; -- country performance in realising lifelong learning outcomes; -- differences in participation in lifelong learning, including along a so-called "digital divide"; -- competencies demanded in the knowledge economy; -- alternate futures for schools.},

  abstract = {Although tacit knowledge constitutes the major part of what we know, it is difficult for organizations to fully benefit from this valuable asset. This is because tacit knowledge is inherently elusive, and in order to capture, store, and disseminate it, it is argued that it first has to be made explicit. However, such a process is difficult, and often fails due to three reasons: (1) we are not necessarily aware of our tacit knowledge, (2) on a personal level, we do not need to make it explicit in order to use it, and (3) we may not want to give up a valuable competitive advantage. During an empirical study of recommender system usage, it was noticed how such technology could be used to circumvent these problems, and make tacit knowledge, in the form of our professional interests, available to the organization as a whole. Using Polanyi's theories, it will be shown how intranet documents can be used to make tacit knowledge tangible without becoming explicit, suggesting that tacitly expressed entities are not necessarily beyond the reach of information technology.},

The generally accepted view sees data as simple facts that become information as data are combined into meaningful structures, which subsequently become knowledge as meaningful information is put into a context and when it can be used to make predictions. According to this view, data are a prerequisite for information, and information is a prerequisite for knowledge. This paper explores the conceptual hierarchy of data, information, and knowledge, showing that data emerge only after we have information, and that information emerges only after we already have knowledge. The reversed hierarchy of knowledge is shown to lead to a different approach in developing information systems that support knowledge management and organizational memory. It is also argued that this difference may have major implications for organizational flexibility and renewal.},

Which paint color is most likely to tell you that a used car is in good shape? How can officials identify the most dangerous New York City manholes before they explode? And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak?  The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. ``Big data'' refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena\textemdash{}from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books\textemdash{}into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven't even done yet, based on big data's ability to predict our future behavior.  In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards.Big Datais the first big book about the next big thing. www.big-data-book.com},

Big data systems use many machines working in parallel to store and process data, which introduces fundamental challenges unfamiliar to most developers.

O m{\'e}todo escolhido para tal an{\'a}lise foi o de entrevistas em profundidade onde os gerentes tiveram a liberdade para expressar os fatos j{\'a} vivenciados dentro de cada uma das nove {\'a}reas de conhecimento sugeridas pelo PMI. A conclus{\~a}o obtida foi que as {\'a}reas de conhecimento mais significativas para o sucesso da implementa{\c c}{\~a}o de gerenciamento de projetos s{\~a}o: escopo, recursos humanos, comunica{\c c}{\~a}o e tempo; por motivos como a falta de informa{\c c}{\~o}es hist{\'o}ricas e falta de m{\~a}o de obra qualificada tamb{\'e}m verificou-se que a {\'a}rea de conhecimento de riscos {\'e} pouco abordada ou utilizada durante a implementa{\c c}{\~a}o de gerenciamento de projetos.},

  abstract = {We present Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs), a distributed memory abstraction that lets programmers perform in-memory computations on large clusters in a fault-tolerant manner. RDDs are motivated by two types of applications that current computing frameworks handle inefficiently: iterative algorithms and interactive data mining tools. In both cases, keeping data in memory can improve performance by an order of magnitude. To achieve fault tolerance efficiently, RDDs provide a restricted form of shared memory, based on coarse-grained transformations rather than fine-grained updates to shared state. However, we show that RDDs are expressive enough to capture a wide class of computations, including recent specialized programming models for iterative jobs, such as Pregel, and new applications that these models do not capture. We have implemented RDDs in a system called Spark, which we evaluate through a variety of user applications and benchmarks.},

This description helps to detect, predict, and express the behavior and feelings of players and personalizes games to their preferences. These models can be automatically created using computational and artificial intelligence techniques which are often enhanced based on the theories derived from human interaction with the games (Yannakakis et al. 2013). It offers two major benefits. First, it helps in content customization to cover broader range of players with different skill levels and adapt challenges on the fly in response to the player's actions (Bakkes et al. ...},

These are the role of computer-based intermediaries (for back up support in problem solving), distributed communication in human-centered multi-agent systems and using computer-based artifacts to model breakdowns in human decision making. The role of intermediaries and distributed communication is illustrated by way of an intelligent distributed multi-agent multimedia euchre application on the net. In addition, aspects of a sales recruitment and benchmarking application are described to illustrate how computer-based artifact is used to overcome breakdowns in the sales, customer service and telesales recruitment decision making. In fact the modeling of the breakdowns is the prime motivator for the sales managers and sales personnel to use the computerized system for management of recruitment and benchmarking. The sales recruitment system described in this chapter (and developed by the first author) has been used in the industry for approximately the past three years.},

The aim of the project is to study the cognitive impacts of awareness tools, i.e., artifacts that allow users of a collaborative system to be aware of what is going on in the joint virtual environment. The focus is on finding an effect on performance as well as on the representation an individual builds of what his partner knows, plans and intends to do (i.e., mutual modeling). We find that using awareness tools has a significant effect by improving task performance. However, the players who were provided with this tool did not show any improvement of their mutual modeling. Further analysis on contrasted groups revealed that there was an effect of the awareness tool on mutual modeling for players who spent a large amount of time using the tool.},

  doi = {10.1007/s00530-012-0275-z},
  abstract = {In games, the goals and interests of players are key factors in their behavior. However, techniques used by networked games to cope with infrequent updates and message loss, such as dead reckoning, estimate a player's movements based mainly on previous observations. The estimations are typically made by using dynamics of motion, taking only inertia and some external factors (e.g., gravity, wind) into account while completely ignoring the player's goals (e.g., chasing other players or collecting objects). This paper proposes AntReckoning: a dead reckoning algorithm, inspired from ant colonies, which models the players' interests to predict their movements. AntReckoning incorporates a player's interest in specific locations, objects, and avatars in the equations of motion in the form of attraction forces. In practice, these points of interest generate pheromones, which spread and fade in the game world, and are a source of attraction. To motivate and validate our approach we collected traces from Quake III. We conducted specific experiments that demonstrate the effect of game-related goals, map features, objects, and other players on the mobility of avatars. Our simulations using traces from Quake III and World of Warcraft show that AntReckoning improves the accuracy by up to 44 \% over traditional dead reckoning techniques and can decrease the upload bandwidth by up to 32 \%.},

In our preliminary experiment, we collected player emotion intensities using a brain-computer interface while playing a survival horror game.

Based on these insights, we introduce the concept of an anticipation-based event selection modeling that aims to choose an event with maximum fear-inducing capability using anticipative emotion.},

To achieve this goal, we propose a methodology to model the player's preferences on virtual camera movements and we employ the resulting models to tailor the viewpoint movements to the player type and her game-play style. Ultimately, the methodology is applied to a 3D platform game and is evaluated through a controlled experiment; the results suggest that the resulting adaptive cinematographic experience is favoured by some player types and it can generate a positive impact on the game performance.},

  abstract = {Dynamic game difficulty balancing, also known as dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) or dynamic game balancing (DGB), is the process of automatically changing parameters, scenarios, and behaviors in a video game in real-time, based on the player's ability, in order to avoid making the player bored (if the game is too easy) or frustrated (if it is too hard). However, letting AI players break the rules to which players are bound can cause the AI to cheat\textemdash{}for example, AI players might be given unlimited speed in racing games to stay near the human player. The goal of dynamic difficulty balancing is to keep the user interested from the beginning to the end, providing a good level of challenge.
Traditionally, game difficulty increases steadily along the course of the game (either in a smooth linear fashion, or through steps represented by levels). The parameters of this increase (rate, frequency, starting levels) can only be modulated at the beginning of the experience by selecting a difficulty level. Still, this can lead to a frustrating experience for both experienced and inexperienced gamers, as they attempt to follow a preselected learning or difficulty curve. Dynamic difficulty balancing attempts to remedy this issue by creating a tailor-made experience for each gamer. As the users' skills improve through time (as they make progress via learning), the level of the challenges should also continually increase. However, implementing such elements poses many challenges to game developers; as a result, this method of gameplay is not widespread.},

  abstract = {Player modeling'' is a loose concept. It can equally apply to everything from a predictive model of player actions resulting from machine learning to a designer's description of a player's expected reactions in response to some piece of game content. This lack of a precise terminology prevents practitioners from quickly finding introductions to applicable modeling methods or determining viable alternatives to their own techniques. We introduce a vocabulary that distinguishes between the major existing player modeling applications and techniques. Four independent facets define the kind for a model: the scope of application, the purpose of use, the domain of modeled details, and the source of a model's derivation or motivation. This vocabulary allows the identification of relevant player modeling methods for particular problems and clarifies the roles that a player model can take. It is intended to be a general vocabulary, applicable to all game genres and research approaches.},

  abstract = {More than a decade after the early research efforts on the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in computer games and the establishment of a new AI domain the term ``game AI'' needs to be redefined. Traditionally, the tasks associated with game AI revolved around non player character (NPC) behavior at different levels of control, varying from navigation and pathfinding to decision making. Commercial-standard games developed over the last 15 years and current game productions, however, suggest that the traditional challenges of game AI have been well addressed via the use of sophisticated AI approaches, not necessarily following or inspired by advances in academic practices. The marginal penetration of traditional academic game AI methods in industrial productions has been mainly due to the lack of constructive communication between academia and industry in the early days of academic game AI, and the inability of academic game AI to propose methods that would significantly advance existing development processes or provide scalable solutions to real world problems. Recently, however, there has been a shift of research focus as the current plethora of AI uses in games is breaking the non-player character AI tradition. A number of those alternative AI uses have already shown a significant potential for the design of better games. This paper presents four key game AI research areas that are currently reshaping the research roadmap in the game AI field and evidently put the game AI term under a new perspective. These game AI flagship research areas include the computational modeling of player experience, the procedural generation of content, the mining of player data on massive-scale and the alternative AI research foci for enhancing NPC capabilities.},
