\chapter{Conclusions}
The goal of your conclusion isn’t to introduce any new ideas, but to sum up everything you’ve written. Specifically, your conclusion should accomplish three major goals:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Restate the main idea of your essay, or your thesis statement
    \item Summarize the sub-points of your essay
    \item Leave the reader with an interesting final impression
\end{enumerate}
